# TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers

 

TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.

For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like `string` and `number`, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.

This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.

This tutorial provides a brief overview of TypeScript, focusing on its type system.

## Types by Inference

TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases.
For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.



```id
tslet helloWorld = "Hello World";        let helloWorld: stringTry
```



By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. This offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. That’s how TypeScript knows that `helloWorld` is a `string` in the above example.

You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion. Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.

## Defining Types

You can use a wide variety of design patterns in JavaScript. However, some design patterns make it difficult for types to be inferred automatically (for example, patterns that use dynamic programming). To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an extension of the JavaScript language, which offers places for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be.

For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes `name: string` and `id: number`, you can write:



```id
tsconst user = {  name: "Hayes",  id: 0,};Try
```



You can explicitly describe this object’s shape using an `interface` declaration:



```id
tsinterface User {  name: string;  id: number;}Try
```



You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new `interface` by using syntax like `: TypeName` after a variable declaration:



```id
tsconst user: User = {  name: "Hayes",  id: 0,};Try
```



If you provide an object that doesn’t match the interface you have provided, TypeScript will warn you:



```id
tsinterface User {  name: string;  id: number;} const user: User = {  username: "Hayes",Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'username' does not exist in type 'User'.2353Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'username' does not exist in type 'User'.  id: 0,};Try
```



Since JavaScript supports classes and object-oriented programming, so does TypeScript. You can use an interface declaration with classes:



```id
tsinterface User {  name: string;  id: number;} class UserAccount {  name: string;  id: number;   constructor(name: string, id: number) {    this.name = name;    this.id = id;  }} const user: User = new UserAccount("Murphy", 1);Try
```



You can use interfaces to annotate parameters and return values to functions:



```id
tsfunction deleteUser(user: User) {  // ...} function getAdminUser(): User {  //...}Try
```



There is already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript: `boolean`, `bigint`, `null`, `number`, `string`, `symbol`, and `undefined`, which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as `any` (allow anything), `unknown` (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), `never` (it’s not possible that this type could happen), and `void` (a function which returns `undefined` or has no return value).

You’ll see that there are two syntaxes for building types: Interfaces and Types . You should prefer `interface`. Use `type` when you need specific features.

## Composing Types

With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones. There are two popular ways to do so: unions and generics.

### Unions

With a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types. For example, you can describe a `boolean` type as being either `true` or `false`:



```id
tstype MyBool = true | false;Try
```



 Note: If you hover over `MyBool` above, you’ll see that it is classed as `boolean`. That’s a property of the Structural Type System. More on this below.

A popular use-case for union types is to describe the set of `string` or `number` literals that a value is allowed to be:



```id
tstype WindowStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized";type LockStates = "locked" | "unlocked";type PositiveOddNumbersUnderTen = 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9;Try
```



Unions provide a way to handle different types too. For example, you may have a function that takes an `array` or a `string`:



```id
tsfunction getLength(obj: string | string[]) {  return obj.length;}Try
```



To learn the type of a variable, use `typeof`:

 
 
 
 Type 
 Predicate 
 
 
 
 
 string 
 `typeof s === "string"` 
 
 
 number 
 `typeof n === "number"` 
 
 
 boolean 
 `typeof b === "boolean"` 
 
 
 undefined 
 `typeof undefined === "undefined"` 
 
 
 function 
 `typeof f === "function"` 
 
 
 array 
 `Array.isArray(a)` 
 
 
 

For example, you can make a function return different values depending on whether it is passed a string or an array:

 


```id
tsfunction wrapInArray(obj: string | string[]) {  if (typeof obj === "string") {    return [obj];            (parameter) obj: string  }  return obj;}Try
```



### Generics

Generics provide variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains.



```id
tstype StringArray = Array<string>;type NumberArray = Array<number>;type ObjectWithNameArray = Array<{ name: string }>;
```



You can declare your own types that use generics:



```id
tsinterface ' >Backpack<' >Type> {  .add: (obj: Type) => void' >add: (obj: ' >Type) => void;  .get: () => Type' >get: () => ' >Type;} // This line is a shortcut to tell TypeScript there is a// constant called `backpack`, and to not worry about where it came from.declare const ' >backpack: ' >Backpack<string>; // object is a string, because we declared it above as the variable part of Backpack.const object = ' >backpack..get: () => string' >get(); // Since the backpack variable is a string, you can&apos;t pass a number to the add function.' >backpack..add: (obj: string) => void' >add(23);Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.2345Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.Try
```



## Structural Type System

One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural typing”.

In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.



```id
tsinterface Point {  x: number;  y: number;} function logPoint(p: Point) {  console.log(`${p.x}, ${p.y}`);} // logs "12, 26"const point = { x: 12, y: 26 };logPoint(point);Try
```



The `point` variable is never declared to be a `Point` type. However, TypeScript compares the shape of `point` to the shape of `Point` in the type-check. They have the same shape, so the code passes.

The shape-matching only requires a subset of the object’s fields to match.



```id
tsconst point3 = { x: 12, y: 26, z: 89 };logPoint(point3); // logs "12, 26" const rect = { x: 33, y: 3, width: 30, height: 80 };logPoint(rect); // logs "33, 3" const color = { hex: "#187ABF" };logPoint(color);Argument of type '{ hex: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Point'.
  Type '{ hex: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Point': x, y2345Argument of type '{ hex: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Point'.
  Type '{ hex: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Point': x, yTry
```



There is no difference between how classes and objects conform to shapes:



```id
tsclass VirtualPoint {  x: number;  y: number;   constructor(x: number, y: number) {    this.x = x;    this.y = y;  }} const newVPoint = new VirtualPoint(13, 56);logPoint(newVPoint); // logs "13, 56"Try
```



If the object or class has all the required properties, TypeScript will say they match, regardless of the implementation details.

# The TypeScript Handbook

 

## About this Handbook

Over 20 years after its introduction to the programming community, JavaScript is now one of the most widespread cross-platform languages ever created. Starting as a small scripting language for adding trivial interactivity to webpages, JavaScript has grown to be a language of choice for both frontend and backend applications of every size. While the size, scope, and complexity of programs written in JavaScript has grown exponentially, the ability of the JavaScript language to express the relationships between different units of code has not. Combined with JavaScript’s rather peculiar runtime semantics, this mismatch between language and program complexity has made JavaScript development a difficult task to manage at scale.

The most common kinds of errors that programmers write can be described as type errors: a certain kind of value was used where a different kind of value was expected. This could be due to simple typos, a failure to understand the API surface of a library, incorrect assumptions about runtime behavior, or other errors. The goal of TypeScript is to be a static typechecker for JavaScript programs - in other words, a tool that runs before your code runs (static) and ensures that the types of the program are correct (typechecked).

If you are coming to TypeScript without a JavaScript background, with the intention of TypeScript being your first language, we recommend you first start reading the documentation on either the Microsoft Learn JavaScript tutorial or read JavaScript at the Mozilla Web Docs .
If you have experience in other languages, you should be able to pick up JavaScript syntax quite quickly by reading the handbook.

## How is this Handbook Structured

The handbook is split into two sections:

 

 The Handbook 

The TypeScript Handbook is intended to be a comprehensive document that explains TypeScript to everyday programmers. You can read the handbook by going from top to bottom in the left-hand navigation.

You should expect each chapter or page to provide you with a strong understanding of the given concepts. The TypeScript Handbook is not a complete language specification, but it is intended to be a comprehensive guide to all of the language’s features and behaviors.

A reader who completes the walkthrough should be able to:

 Read and understand commonly-used TypeScript syntax and patterns

- Explain the effects of important compiler options

- Correctly predict type system behavior in most cases

In the interests of clarity and brevity, the main content of the Handbook will not explore every edge case or minutiae of the features being covered. You can find more details on particular concepts in the reference articles.

 
- 

 Reference Files 

The reference section below the handbook in the navigation is built to provide a richer understanding of how a particular part of TypeScript works. You can read it top-to-bottom, but each section aims to provide a deeper explanation of a single concept - meaning there is no aim for continuity.

### Non-Goals

The Handbook is also intended to be a concise document that can be comfortably read in a few hours. Certain topics won’t be covered in order to keep things short.

Specifically, the Handbook does not fully introduce core JavaScript basics like functions, classes, and closures. Where appropriate, we’ll include links to background reading that you can use to read up on those concepts.

The Handbook also isn’t intended to be a replacement for a language specification. In some cases, edge cases or formal descriptions of behavior will be skipped in favor of high-level, easier-to-understand explanations. Instead, there are separate reference pages that more precisely and formally describe many aspects of TypeScript’s behavior. The reference pages are not intended for readers unfamiliar with TypeScript, so they may use advanced terminology or reference topics you haven’t read about yet.

Finally, the Handbook won’t cover how TypeScript interacts with other tools, except where necessary. Topics like how to configure TypeScript with webpack, rollup, parcel, react, babel, closure, lerna, rush, bazel, preact, vue, angular, svelte, jquery, yarn, or npm are out of scope - you can find these resources elsewhere on the web.

## Get Started

Before getting started with The Basics , we recommend reading one of the following introductory pages. These introductions are intended to highlight key similarities and differences between TypeScript and your favored programming language, and clear up common misconceptions specific to those languages.

- TypeScript for the New Programmer 

- TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers 

- TypeScript for Java/C# Programmers 

- TypeScript for Functional Programmers 

Otherwise, jump to The Basics .

# TypeScript for the New Programmer

 

Congratulations on choosing TypeScript as one of your first languages — you’re already making good decisions!

You’ve probably already heard that TypeScript is a “flavor” or “variant” of JavaScript.
The relationship between TypeScript (TS) and JavaScript (JS) is rather unique among modern programming languages, so learning more about this relationship will help you understand how TypeScript adds to JavaScript.

## What is JavaScript? A Brief History

JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript) started its life as a simple scripting language for browsers.
At the time it was invented, it was expected to be used for short snippets of code embedded in a web page — writing more than a few dozen lines of code would have been somewhat unusual.
Due to this, early web browsers executed such code pretty slowly.
Over time, though, JS became more and more popular, and web developers started using it to create interactive experiences.

Web browser developers responded to this increased JS usage by optimizing their execution engines (dynamic compilation) and extending what could be done with it (adding APIs), which in turn made web developers use it even more.
On modern websites, your browser is frequently running applications that span hundreds of thousands of lines of code.
This is the long and gradual growth of “the web”, starting as a simple network of static pages, and evolving into a platform for rich applications of all kinds.

More than this, JS has become popular enough to be used outside the context of browsers, such as implementing JS servers using node.js.
The “run anywhere” nature of JS makes it an attractive choice for cross-platform development.
There are many developers these days that use only JavaScript to program their entire stack!

To summarize, we have a language that was designed for quick uses, and then grew to a full-fledged tool to write applications with millions of lines.
Every language has its own quirks — oddities and surprises, and JavaScript’s humble beginning makes it have many of these. Some examples:

 

JavaScript’s equality operator (`==`) coerces its operands, leading to unexpected behavior:



```id
jsif ("" == 0) {  // It is! But why??}if (1 < x < 3) {  // True for *any* value of x!}
```



- 

JavaScript also allows accessing properties which aren’t present:



```id
jsconst obj = { width: 10, height: 15 };// Why is this NaN? Spelling is hard!const area = obj.width * obj.heigth;
```



Most programming languages would throw an error when these sorts of errors occur, some would do so during compilation — before any code is running.
When writing small programs, such quirks are annoying but manageable; when writing applications with hundreds or thousands of lines of code, these constant surprises are a serious problem.

## TypeScript: A Static Type Checker

We said earlier that some languages wouldn’t allow those buggy programs to run at all.
Detecting errors in code without running it is referred to as static checking .
Determining what’s an error and what’s not based on the kinds of values being operated on is known as static type checking.

TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values , making it a static type checker .
For example, the last example above has an error because of the type of `obj`.
Here’s the error TypeScript found:



```id
tsconst obj = { width: 10, height: 15 };const area = obj.width * obj.heigth;Property 'heigth' does not exist on type '{ width: number; height: number; }'. Did you mean 'height'?2551Property 'heigth' does not exist on type '{ width: number; height: number; }'. Did you mean 'height'?Try
```



### A Typed Superset of JavaScript

How does TypeScript relate to JavaScript, though?

#### Syntax

TypeScript is a language that is a superset of JavaScript: JS syntax is therefore legal TS.
Syntax refers to the way we write text to form a program.
For example, this code has a syntax error because it’s missing a `)`:



```id
tslet a = (4')' expected.1005')' expected.Try
```



TypeScript doesn’t consider any JavaScript code to be an error because of its syntax.
This means you can take any working JavaScript code and put it in a TypeScript file without worrying about exactly how it is written.

#### Types

However, TypeScript is a typed superset, meaning that it adds rules about how different kinds of values can be used.
The earlier error about `obj.heigth` was not a syntax error: it is an error of using some kind of value (a type ) in an incorrect way.

As another example, this is JavaScript code that you can run in your browser, and it will log a value:



```id
jsconsole.log(4 / []);
```



This syntactically-legal program logs `Infinity`.
TypeScript, though, considers division of number by an array to be a nonsensical operation, and will issue an error:



```id
tsconsole.log(4 / []);The right-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type.2363The right-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type.Try
```



It’s possible you really did intend to divide a number by an array, perhaps just to see what happens, but most of the time, though, this is a programming mistake.
TypeScript’s type checker is designed to allow correct programs through while still catching as many common errors as possible.
(Later, we’ll learn about settings you can use to configure how strictly TypeScript checks your code.)

If you move some code from a JavaScript file to a TypeScript file, you might see type errors depending on how the code is written.
These may be legitimate problems with the code, or TypeScript being overly conservative.
Throughout this guide we’ll demonstrate how to add various TypeScript syntax to eliminate such errors.

#### Runtime Behavior

TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript.
For example, dividing by zero in JavaScript produces `Infinity` instead of throwing a runtime exception.
As a principle, TypeScript never changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.

This means that if you move code from JavaScript to TypeScript, it is guaranteed to run the same way, even if TypeScript thinks that the code has type errors.

Keeping the same runtime behavior as JavaScript is a foundational promise of TypeScript because it means you can easily transition between the two languages without worrying about subtle differences that might make your program stop working.

 

#### Erased Types

Roughly speaking, once TypeScript’s compiler is done with checking your code, it erases the types to produce the resulting “compiled” code.
This means that once your code is compiled, the resulting plain JS code has no type information.

This also means that TypeScript never changes the behavior of your program based on the types it inferred.
The bottom line is that while you might see type errors during compilation, the type system itself has no bearing on how your program works when it runs.

Finally, TypeScript doesn’t provide any additional runtime libraries.
Your programs will use the same standard library (or external libraries) as JavaScript programs, so there’s no additional TypeScript-specific framework to learn.

 

## Learning JavaScript and TypeScript

We frequently see the question “Should I learn JavaScript or TypeScript?“.

The answer is that you can’t learn TypeScript without learning JavaScript!
TypeScript shares syntax and runtime behavior with JavaScript, so anything you learn about JavaScript is helping you learn TypeScript at the same time.

There are many, many resources available for programmers to learn JavaScript; you should not ignore these resources if you’re writing TypeScript.
For example, there are about 20 times more StackOverflow questions tagged `javascript` than `typescript`, but all of the `javascript` questions also apply to TypeScript.

If you find yourself searching for something like “how to sort a list in TypeScript”, remember: TypeScript is JavaScript’s runtime with a compile-time type checker .
The way you sort a list in TypeScript is the same way you do so in JavaScript.
If you find a resource that uses TypeScript directly, that’s great too, but don’t limit yourself to thinking you need TypeScript-specific answers for everyday questions about how to accomplish runtime tasks.

# TypeScript for Java/C# Programmers

 

TypeScript is a popular choice for programmers accustomed to other languages with static typing, such as C# and Java.

TypeScript’s type system offers many of the same benefits, such as better code completion, earlier detection of errors, and clearer communication between parts of your program.
While TypeScript provides many familiar features for these developers, it’s worth stepping back to see how JavaScript (and therefore TypeScript) differ from traditional OOP languages.
Understanding these differences will help you write better JavaScript code, and avoid common pitfalls that programmers who go straight from C#/Java to TypeScript may fall into.

## Co-learning JavaScript

If you’re familiar with JavaScript already but are primarily a Java or C# programmer, this introductory page can help explain some of the common misconceptions and pitfalls you might be susceptible to.
Some of the ways that TypeScript models types are quite different from Java or C#, and it’s important to keep these in mind when learning TypeScript.

If you’re a Java or C# programmer that is new to JavaScript in general, we recommend learning a little bit of JavaScript without types first to understand JavaScript’s runtime behaviors.
Because TypeScript doesn’t change how your code runs , you’ll still have to learn how JavaScript works in order to write code that actually does something!

It’s important to remember that TypeScript uses the same runtime as JavaScript, so any resources about how to accomplish specific runtime behavior (converting a string to a number, displaying an alert, writing a file to disk, etc.) will always apply equally well to TypeScript programs.
Don’t limit yourself to TypeScript-specific resources!

## Rethinking the Class

C# and Java are what we might call mandatory OOP languages.
In these languages, the class is the basic unit of code organization, and also the basic container of all data and behavior at runtime.
Forcing all functionality and data to be held in classes can be a good domain model for some problems, but not every domain needs to be represented this way.

### Free Functions and Data

In JavaScript, functions can live anywhere, and data can be passed around freely without being inside a pre-defined `class` or `struct`.
This flexibility is extremely powerful.
“Free” functions (those not associated with a class) working over data without an implied OOP hierarchy tend to be the preferred model for writing programs in JavaScript.

### Static Classes

Additionally, certain constructs from C# and Java such as singletons and static classes are unnecessary in TypeScript.

## OOP in TypeScript

That said, you can still use classes if you like!
Some problems are well-suited to being solved by a traditional OOP hierarchy, and TypeScript’s support for JavaScript classes will make these models even more powerful.
TypeScript supports many common patterns such as implementing interfaces, inheritance, and static methods.

We’ll cover classes later in this guide.

## Rethinking Types

TypeScript’s understanding of a type is actually quite different from C# or Java’s.
Let’s explore some differences.

### Nominal Reified Type Systems

In C# or Java, any given value or object has one exact type - either `null`, a primitive, or a known class type.
We can call methods like `value.GetType()` or `value.getClass()` to query the exact type at runtime.
The definition of this type will reside in a class somewhere with some name, and we can’t use two classes with similar shapes in lieu of each other unless there’s an explicit inheritance relationship or commonly-implemented interface.

These aspects describe a reified, nominal type system.
The types we wrote in the code are present at runtime, and the types are related via their declarations, not their structures.

### Types as Sets

In C# or Java, it’s meaningful to think of a one-to-one correspondence between runtime types and their compile-time declarations.

In TypeScript, it’s better to think of a type as a set of values that share something in common.
Because types are just sets, a particular value can belong to many sets at the same time.

Once you start thinking of types as sets, certain operations become very natural.
For example, in C#, it’s awkward to pass around a value that is either a `string` or `int`, because there isn’t a single type that represents this sort of value.

In TypeScript, this becomes very natural once you realize that every type is just a set.
How do you describe a value that either belongs in the `string` set or the `number` set?
It simply belongs to the union of those sets: `string | number`.

TypeScript provides a number of mechanisms to work with types in a set-theoretic way, and you’ll find them more intuitive if you think of types as sets.

### Erased Structural Types

In TypeScript, objects are not of a single exact type.
For example, if we construct an object that satisfies an interface, we can use that object where that interface is expected even though there was no declarative relationship between the two.



```id
tsinterface Pointlike {  x: number;  y: number;}interface Named {  name: string;} function logPoint(point: Pointlike) {  console.log("x = " + point.x + ", y = " + point.y);} function logName(x: Named) {  console.log("Hello, " + x.name);} const obj = {  x: 0,  y: 0,  name: "Origin",}; logPoint(obj);logName(obj);Try
```



TypeScript’s type system is structural , not nominal: We can use `obj` as a `Pointlike` because it has `x` and `y` properties that are both numbers.
The relationships between types are determined by the properties they contain, not whether they were declared with some particular relationship.

TypeScript’s type system is also not reified : There’s nothing at runtime that will tell us that `obj` is `Pointlike`.
In fact, the `Pointlike` type is not present in any form at runtime.

Going back to the idea of types as sets , we can think of `obj` as being a member of both the `Pointlike` set of values and the `Named` set of values.

### Consequences of Structural Typing

OOP programmers are often surprised by two particular aspects of structural typing.

#### Empty Types

The first is that the empty type seems to defy expectation:



```id
tsclass Empty {} function fn(arg: Empty) {  // do something?} // No error, but this isn&apos;t an &apos;Empty&apos; ?fn({ k: 10 });Try
```



TypeScript determines if the call to `fn` here is valid by seeing if the provided argument is a valid `Empty`.
It does so by examining the structure of `{ k: 10 }` and `class Empty { }`.
We can see that `{ k: 10 }` has all of the properties that `Empty` does, because `Empty` has no properties.
Therefore, this is a valid call!

This may seem surprising, but it’s ultimately a very similar relationship to one enforced in nominal OOP languages.
A subclass cannot remove a property of its base class, because doing so would destroy the natural subtype relationship between the derived class and its base.
Structural type systems simply identify this relationship implicitly by describing subtypes in terms of having properties of compatible types.

#### Identical Types

Another frequent source of surprise comes with identical types:



```id
tsclass Car {  drive() {    // hit the gas  }}class Golfer {  drive() {    // hit the ball far  }}// No error?let w: Car = new Golfer();
```



Again, this isn’t an error because the structures of these classes are the same.
While this may seem like a potential source of confusion, in practice, identical classes that shouldn’t be related are not common.

We’ll learn more about how classes relate to each other in the Classes chapter.

### Reflection

OOP programmers are accustomed to being able to query the type of any value, even a generic one:



```id
csharp// C#static void LogType<T>() {    Console.WriteLine(typeof(T).Name);}
```



Because TypeScript’s type system is fully erased, information about e.g. the instantiation of a generic type parameter is not available at runtime.

JavaScript does have some limited primitives like `typeof` and `instanceof`, but remember that these operators are still working on the values as they exist in the type-erased output code.
For example, `typeof (new Car())` will be `"object"`, not `Car` or `"Car"`.

# TypeScript for Functional Programmers

 

TypeScript began its life as an attempt to bring traditional object-oriented types
to JavaScript so that the programmers at Microsoft could bring
traditional object-oriented programs to the web. As it has developed, TypeScript’s type
system has evolved to model code written by native JavaScripters. The
resulting system is powerful, interesting and messy.

This introduction is designed for working Haskell or ML programmers
who want to learn TypeScript. It describes how the type system of
TypeScript differs from Haskell’s type system. It also describes
unique features of TypeScript’s type system that arise from its
modelling of JavaScript code.

This introduction does not cover object-oriented programming. In
practice, object-oriented programs in TypeScript are similar to those
in other popular languages with OO features.

## Prerequisites

In this introduction, I assume you know the following:

 How to program in JavaScript, the good parts.

- Type syntax of a C-descended language.

If you need to learn the good parts of JavaScript, read
 JavaScript: The Good Parts .
You may be able to skip the book if you know how to write programs in
a call-by-value lexically scoped language with lots of mutability and
not much else.
 R 4 RS Scheme is a good example.

 The C++ Programming Language is
a good place to learn about C-style type syntax. Unlike C++,
TypeScript uses postfix types, like so: `x: string` instead of `string x`.

## Concepts not in Haskell

### Built-in types

JavaScript defines 8 built-in types:

 
 
 
 Type 
 Explanation 
 
 
 
 
 `Number` 
 a double-precision IEEE 754 floating point. 
 
 
 `String` 
 an immutable UTF-16 string. 
 
 
 `BigInt` 
 integers in the arbitrary precision format. 
 
 
 `Boolean` 
 `true` and `false`. 
 
 
 `Symbol` 
 a unique value usually used as a key. 
 
 
 `Null` 
 equivalent to the unit type. 
 
 
 `Undefined` 
 also equivalent to the unit type. 
 
 
 `Object` 
 similar to records. 
 
 
 

 See the MDN page for more detail .

TypeScript has corresponding primitive types for the built-in types:

- `number`

- `string`

- `bigint`

- `boolean`

- `symbol`

- `null`

- `undefined`

- `object`

#### Other important TypeScript types

 
 
 
 Type 
 Explanation 
 
 
 
 
 `unknown` 
 the top type. 
 
 
 `never` 
 the bottom type. 
 
 
 object literal 
 e.g. `{ property: Type }` 
 
 
 `void` 
 for functions with no documented return value 
 
 
 `T[]` 
 mutable arrays, also written `Array ` 
 
 
 `[T, T]` 
 tuples, which are fixed-length but mutable 
 
 
 `(t: T) => U` 
 functions 
 
 
 

Notes:

- 

Function syntax includes parameter names. This is pretty hard to get used to!



```id
tslet fst: (a: any, b: any) => any = (a, b) => a;// or more precisely:let fst: <T, U>(a: T, b: U) => T = (a, b) => a;
```



- 

Object literal type syntax closely mirrors object literal value syntax:



```id
tslet o: { n: number; xs: object[] } = { n: 1, xs: [] };
```



- 

`[T, T]` is a subtype of `T[]`. This is different than Haskell, where tuples are not related to lists.

#### Boxed types

JavaScript has boxed equivalents of primitive types that contain the
methods that programmers associate with those types. TypeScript
reflects this with, for example, the difference between the primitive
type `number` and the boxed type `Number`. The boxed types are rarely
needed, since their methods return primitives.



```id
ts(1).toExponential();// equivalent toNumber.prototype.toExponential.call(1);
```



Note that calling a method on a numeric literal requires it to be in
parentheses to aid the parser.

### Gradual typing

TypeScript uses the type `any` whenever it can’t tell what the type of
an expression should be. Compared to `Dynamic`, calling `any` a type
is an overstatement. It just turns off the type checker
wherever it appears. For example, you can push any value into an
`any[]` without marking the value in any way:



```id
ts// with "noImplicitAny": false in tsconfig.json, anys: any[]const anys = [];anys..push(...items: any[]): number' >push(1);anys..push(...items: any[]): number' >push("oh no");anys..push(...items: any[]): number' >push({ anything: "goes" });Try
```



And you can use an expression of type `any` anywhere:



```id
tsanys.map(anys[1]); // oh no, "oh no" is not a function
```



`any` is contagious, too — if you initialize a variable with an
expression of type `any`, the variable has type `any` too.



```id
tslet sepsis = anys[0] + anys[1]; // this could mean anything
```



To get an error when TypeScript produces an `any`, use
`"noImplicitAny": true`, or `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`.

### Structural typing

Structural typing is a familiar concept to most functional
programmers, although Haskell and most MLs are not
structurally typed. Its basic form is pretty simple:



```id
ts// @strict: falselet o = { x: "hi", extra: 1 }; // oklet o2: { x: string } = o; // ok
```



Here, the object literal `{ x: "hi", extra: 1 }` has a matching
literal type `{ x: string, extra: number }`. That
type is assignable to `{ x: string }` since
it has all the required properties and those properties have
assignable types. The extra property doesn’t prevent assignment, it
just makes it a subtype of `{ x: string }`.

Named types just give a name to a type; for assignability purposes
there’s no difference between the type alias `One` and the interface
type `Two` below. They both have a property `p: string`. (Type aliases
behave differently from interfaces with respect to recursive
definitions and type parameters, however.)



```id
tstype One = { p: string };interface Two {  p: string;}class Three {  p = "Hello";} let x: One = { p: "hi" };let two: Two = x;two = new Three();Try
```



### Unions

In TypeScript, union types are untagged. In other words, they are not
discriminated unions like `data` in Haskell. However, you can often
discriminate types in a union using built-in tags or other properties.



```id
tsfunction  string) | {
    s: string;
}): string' >start(   string)' >arg: string | string[] | (() => string) | { s: string }): string {  // this is super common in JavaScript  if (typeof  string)' >arg === "string") {    return commonCase(arg);  } else if (Array.isArray( string)' >arg)) {    return arg..map<string>(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => string, thisArg?: any): string[]' >map(commonCase)..join(separator?: string): string' >join(",");  } else if (typeof  string)' >arg === "function") {    return commonCase( string' >arg());  } else {    return commonCase(arg.s);  }   function commonCase(s: string): string {    // finally, just convert a string to another string    return s;  }}Try
```



`string`, `Array` and `Function` have built-in type predicates,
conveniently leaving the object type for the `else` branch. It is
possible, however, to generate unions that are difficult to
differentiate at runtime. For new code, it’s best to build only
discriminated unions.

The following types have built-in predicates:

 
 
 
 Type 
 Predicate 
 
 
 
 
 string 
 `typeof s === "string"` 
 
 
 number 
 `typeof n === "number"` 
 
 
 bigint 
 `typeof m === "bigint"` 
 
 
 boolean 
 `typeof b === "boolean"` 
 
 
 symbol 
 `typeof g === "symbol"` 
 
 
 undefined 
 `typeof undefined === "undefined"` 
 
 
 function 
 `typeof f === "function"` 
 
 
 array 
 `Array.isArray(a)` 
 
 
 object 
 `typeof o === "object"` 
 
 
 

Note that functions and arrays are objects at runtime, but have their
own predicates.

#### Intersections

In addition to unions, TypeScript also has intersections:



```id
tstype Combined = { a: number } & { b: string };type Conflicting = { a: number } & { a: string };Try
```



`Combined` has two properties, `a` and `b`, just as if they had been
written as one object literal type. Intersection and union are
recursive in case of conflicts, so `Conflicting.a: number & string`.

### Unit types

Unit types are subtypes of primitive types that contain exactly one
primitive value. For example, the string `"foo"` has the type
`"foo"`. Since JavaScript has no built-in enums, it is common to use a set of
well-known strings instead. Unions of string literal types allow
TypeScript to type this pattern:



```id
tsdeclare function pad(s: string, n: number, direction: "left" | "right"): string;pad("hi", 10, "left");Try
```



When needed, the compiler widens — converts to a
supertype — the unit type to the primitive type, such as `"foo"`
to `string`. This happens when using mutability, which can hamper some
uses of mutable variables:



```id
tslet s = "right";pad("hi", 10, s); // error: &apos;string&apos; is not assignable to &apos;"left" | "right"&apos;Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right"'.2345Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right"'.Try
```



Here’s how the error happens:

- `"right": "right"`

- `s: string` because `"right"` widens to `string` on assignment to a mutable variable.

- `string` is not assignable to `"left" | "right"`

You can work around this with a type annotation for `s`, but that
in turn prevents assignments to `s` of variables that are not of type
`"left" | "right"`.



```id
tslet s: "left" | "right" = "right";pad("hi", 10, s);Try
```



## Concepts similar to Haskell

### Contextual typing

TypeScript has some obvious places where it can infer types, like
variable declarations:



```id
tslet s = "I&apos;m a string!";Try
```



But it also infers types in a few other places that you may not expect
if you’ve worked with other C-syntax languages:



```id
tsdeclare function (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >map<(f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >T, (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >U>( U' >f: (t: (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >T) => (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >U, ts: (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >T[]): (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >U[];let sns = (f: (t: number) => string, ts: number[]): string[]' >map((n) => n.toString(), [1, 2, 3]);Try
```



Here, `n: number` in this example also, despite the fact that `T` and `U`
have not been inferred before the call. In fact, after `[1,2,3]` has
been used to infer `T=number`, the return type of `n => n.toString()`
is used to infer `U=string`, causing `sns` to have the type
`string[]`.

Note that inference will work in any order, but intellisense will only
work left-to-right, so TypeScript prefers to declare `map` with the
array first:



```id
tsdeclare function (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >map<(ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >T, (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >U>(ts: (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >T[],  U' >f: (t: (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >T) => (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >U): (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >U[];Try
```



Contextual typing also works recursively through object literals, and
on unit types that would otherwise be inferred as `string` or
`number`. And it can infer return types from context:



```id
tsdeclare function (thunk: (t: T) => void): T' >run<(thunk: (t: T) => void): T' >T>( void' >thunk: (t: (thunk: (t: T) => void): T' >T) => void): (thunk: (t: T) => void): T' >T;let i: { inference: string } = (thunk: (t: {
    inference: string;
}) => void): {
    inference: string;
}' >run((o) => {  o.inference = "INSERT STATE HERE";});Try
```



The type of `o` is determined to be `{ inference: string }` because

- Declaration initializers are contextually typed by the
declaration’s type: `{ inference: string }`.

- The return type of a call uses the contextual type for inferences,
so the compiler infers that `T={ inference: string }`.

- Arrow functions use the contextual type to type their parameters,
so the compiler gives `o: { inference: string }`.

And it does so while you are typing, so that after typing `o.`, you
get completions for the property `inference`, along with any other
properties you’d have in a real program.
Altogether, this feature can make TypeScript’s inference look a bit
like a unifying type inference engine, but it is not.

### Type aliases

Type aliases are mere aliases, just like `type` in Haskell. The
compiler will attempt to use the alias name wherever it was used in
the source code, but does not always succeed.



```id
tstype Size = [number, number];let x: Size = [101.1, 999.9];Try
```



The closest equivalent to `newtype` is a tagged intersection :



```id
tstype FString = string & { __compileTimeOnly: any };
```



An `FString` is just like a normal string, except that the compiler
thinks it has a property named `__compileTimeOnly` that doesn’t
actually exist. This means that `FString` can still be assigned to
`string`, but not the other way round.

### Discriminated Unions

The closest equivalent to `data` is a union of types with discriminant
properties, normally called discriminated unions in TypeScript:



```id
tstype Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; x: number }  | { kind: "triangle"; x: number; y: number };
```



Unlike Haskell, the tag, or discriminant, is just a property in each
object type. Each variant has an identical property with a different
unit type. This is still a normal union type; the leading `|` is
an optional part of the union type syntax. You can discriminate the
members of the union using normal JavaScript code:



```id
tstype Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; x: number }  | { kind: "triangle"; x: number; y: number }; function area(s: Shape) {  if (s.kind === "circle") {    return Math.PI * s.radius * s.radius;  } else if (s.kind === "square") {    return s.x * s.x;  } else {    return (s.x * s.y) / 2;  }}Try
```



Note that the return type of `area` is inferred to be `number` because
TypeScript knows the function is total. If some variant is not
covered, the return type of `area` will be `number | undefined` instead.

Also, unlike Haskell, common properties show up in any union, so you
can usefully discriminate multiple members of the union:



```id
tsfunction height(s: Shape) {  if (s.kind === "circle") {    return 2 * s.radius;  } else {    // s.kind: "square" | "triangle"    return s.x;  }}Try
```



### Type Parameters

Like most C-descended languages, TypeScript requires declaration of
type parameters:



```id
tsfunction liftArray<T>(t: T): Array<T> {  return [t];}
```



There is no case requirement, but type parameters are conventionally
single uppercase letters. Type parameters can also be constrained to a
type, which behaves a bit like type class constraints:



```id
tsfunction firstish<T extends { length: number }>(t1: T, t2: T): T {  return t1.length > t2.length ? t1 : t2;}
```



TypeScript can usually infer type arguments from a call based on the
type of the arguments, so type arguments are usually not needed.

Because TypeScript is structural, it doesn’t need type parameters as
much as nominal systems. Specifically, they are not needed to make a
function polymorphic. Type parameters should only be used to
 propagate type information, such as constraining parameters to be
the same type:



```id
tsfunction length<T extends ArrayLike<unknown>>(t: T): number {}function length(t: ArrayLike<unknown>): number {}
```



In the first `length`, T is not necessary; notice that it’s only
referenced once, so it’s not being used to constrain the type of the
return value or other parameters.

#### Higher-kinded types

TypeScript does not have higher kinded types, so the following is not legal:



```id
tsfunction length<T extends ArrayLike<unknown>, U>(m: T<U>) {}
```



#### Point-free programming

Point-free programming — heavy use of currying and function
composition — is possible in JavaScript, but can be verbose.
In TypeScript, type inference often fails for point-free programs, so
you’ll end up specifying type parameters instead of value parameters. The
result is so verbose that it’s usually better to avoid point-free
programming.

### Module system

JavaScript’s modern module syntax is a bit like Haskell’s, except that
any file with `import` or `export` is implicitly a module:



```id
tsimport { value, Type } from "npm-package";import { other, Types } from "./local-package";import * as prefix from "../lib/third-package";
```



You can also import commonjs modules — modules written using node.js’
module system:



```id
tsimport f = require("single-function-package");
```



You can export with an export list:



```id
tsexport { f };function f() {  return g();}function g() {} // g is not exported
```



Or by marking each export individually:



```id
tsexport function f() { return g() }function g() { }
```



The latter style is more common but both are allowed, even in the same
file.

### `readonly` and `const`

In JavaScript, mutability is the default, although it allows variable
declarations with `const` to declare that the reference is
immutable. The referent is still mutable:



```id
jsconst a = [1, 2, 3];a.push(102); // ):a[0] = 101; // D:
```



TypeScript additionally has a `readonly` modifier for properties.



```id
tsinterface Rx {  readonly x: number;}let rx: Rx = { x: 1 };rx.x = 12; // error
```



It also ships with a mapped type `Readonly ` that makes
all properties `readonly`:



```id
tsinterface X {  x: number;}let rx: Readonly<X> = { x: 1 };rx.x = 12; // error
```



And it has a specific `ReadonlyArray ` type that removes
side-affecting methods and prevents writing to indices of the array,
as well as special syntax for this type:



```id
tslet a: ReadonlyArray<number> = [1, 2, 3];let b: readonly number[] = [1, 2, 3];a.push(102); // errorb[0] = 101; // error
```



You can also use a const-assertion, which operates on arrays and
object literals:



```id
tslet a = [1, 2, 3] as const;a.push(102); // errora[0] = 101; // error
```



However, none of these options are the default, so they are not
consistently used in TypeScript code.

# TypeScript Tooling in 5 minutes

 

Let’s get started by building a simple web application with TypeScript.

## Installing TypeScript

There are two main ways to add TypeScript to your project:

 Via npm (the Node.js package manager)

- By installing TypeScript’s Visual Studio plugins

Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 include TypeScript language support by default but does not include the TypeScript compiler, `tsc`.
If you didn’t install TypeScript with Visual Studio, you can still download it .

For npm users:



```id
shell> npm install -g typescript
```



## Building your first TypeScript file

In your editor, type the following JavaScript code in `greeter.ts`:



```id
tsfunction greeter(person) {  return "Hello, " + person;} let user = "Jane User"; document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Try
```



## Compiling your code

We used a `.ts` extension, but this code is just JavaScript.
You could have copy/pasted this straight out of an existing JavaScript app.

At the command line, run the TypeScript compiler:



```id
shelltsc greeter.ts
```



The result will be a file `greeter.js` which contains the same JavaScript that you fed in.
We’re up and running using TypeScript in our JavaScript app!

Now we can start taking advantage of some of the new tools TypeScript offers.
Add a `: string` type annotation to the ‘person’ function parameter as shown here:



```id
tsfunction greeter(person: string) {  return "Hello, " + person;} let user = "Jane User"; document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Try
```



## Type annotations

Type annotations in TypeScript are lightweight ways to record the intended contract of the function or variable.
In this case, we intend the greeter function to be called with a single string parameter.
We can try changing the call greeter to pass an array instead:



```id
tsfunction greeter(person: string) {  return "Hello, " + person;} let user = [0, 1, 2]; document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.2345Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.Try
```



Re-compiling, you’ll now see an error:



```id
shellerror TS2345: Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```



Similarly, try removing all the arguments to the greeter call.
TypeScript will let you know that you have called this function with an unexpected number of arguments.
In both cases, TypeScript can offer static analysis based on both the structure of your code, and the type annotations you provide.

Notice that although there were errors, the `greeter.js` file is still created.
You can use TypeScript even if there are errors in your code. But in this case, TypeScript is warning that your code will likely not run as expected.

## Interfaces

Let’s develop our sample further. Here we use an interface that describes objects that have a firstName and lastName field.
In TypeScript, two types are compatible if their internal structure is compatible.
This allows us to implement an interface just by having the shape the interface requires, without an explicit `implements` clause.



```id
tsinterface Person {  firstName: string;  lastName: string;} function greeter(person: Person) {  return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;} let user = { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "User" }; document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Try
```



## Classes

Finally, let’s extend the example one last time with classes.
TypeScript supports new features in JavaScript, like support for class-based object-oriented programming.

Here we’re going to create a `Student` class with a constructor and a few public fields.
Notice that classes and interfaces play well together, letting the programmer decide on the right level of abstraction.

Also of note, the use of `public` on parameters to the constructor is a shorthand that allows us to automatically create properties with that name.



```id
tsclass Student {  fullName: string;  constructor(    public firstName: string,    public middleInitial: string,    public lastName: string  ) {    this.fullName = firstName + " " + middleInitial + " " + lastName;  }} interface Person {  firstName: string;  lastName: string;} function greeter(person: Person) {  return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;} let user = new Student("Jane", "M.", "User"); document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Try
```



Re-run `tsc greeter.ts` and you’ll see the generated JavaScript is the same as the earlier code.
Classes in TypeScript are just a shorthand for the same prototype-based OO that is frequently used in JavaScript.

## Running your TypeScript web app

Now type the following in `greeter.html`:



```id
html<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <title>TypeScript Greeter</title>  </head>  <body>    <script src="greeter.js"></script>  </body></html>
```



Open `greeter.html` in the browser to run your first simple TypeScript web application!

Optional: Open `greeter.ts` in Visual Studio, or copy the code into the TypeScript playground.
You can hover over identifiers to see their types.
Notice that in some cases these types are inferred automatically for you.
Re-type the last line, and see completion lists and parameter help based on the types of the DOM elements.
Put your cursor on the reference to the greeter function, and hit F12 to go to its definition.
Notice, too, that you can right-click on a symbol and use refactoring to rename it.

The type information provided works together with the tools to work with JavaScript at application scale.
For more examples of what’s possible in TypeScript, see the Samples section of the website.

### TypeScript: Documentation - The Basics

# The Basics

 

Welcome to the first page of the handbook. If this is your first experience with TypeScript - you may want to start at one of the ' Getting Started ' guides 
 Each and every value in JavaScript has a set of behaviors you can observe from running different operations.
That sounds abstract, but as a quick example, consider some operations we might run on a variable named `message`.



```id
js// Accessing the property 'toLowerCase'// on 'message' and then calling itmessage.toLowerCase();// Calling 'message'message();
```



If we break this down, the first runnable line of code accesses a property called `toLowerCase` and then calls it.
The second one tries to call `message` directly.

But assuming we don’t know the value of `message` - and that’s pretty common - we can’t reliably say what results we’ll get from trying to run any of this code.
The behavior of each operation depends entirely on what value we had in the first place.

 Is `message` callable?

- Does it have a property called `toLowerCase` on it?

- If it does, is `toLowerCase` even callable?

- If both of these values are callable, what do they return?

The answers to these questions are usually things we keep in our heads when we write JavaScript, and we have to hope we got all the details right.

Let’s say `message` was defined in the following way.



```id
jsconst message = "Hello World!";
```



As you can probably guess, if we try to run `message.toLowerCase()`, we’ll get the same string only in lower-case.

What about that second line of code?
If you’re familiar with JavaScript, you’ll know this fails with an exception:



```id
txtTypeError: message is not a function
```



It’d be great if we could avoid mistakes like this.

When we run our code, the way that our JavaScript runtime chooses what to do is by figuring out the type of the value - what sorts of behaviors and capabilities it has.
That’s part of what that `TypeError` is alluding to - it’s saying that the string `"Hello World!"` cannot be called as a function.

For some values, such as the primitives `string` and `number`, we can identify their type at runtime using the `typeof` operator.
But for other things like functions, there’s no corresponding runtime mechanism to identify their types.
For example, consider this function:



```id
jsfunction fn(x) {  return x.flip();}
```



We can observe by reading the code that this function will only work if given an object with a callable `flip` property, but JavaScript doesn’t surface this information in a way that we can check while the code is running.
The only way in pure JavaScript to tell what `fn` does with a particular value is to call it and see what happens.
This kind of behavior makes it hard to predict what the code will do before it runs, which means it’s harder to know what your code is going to do while you’re writing it.

Seen in this way, a type is the concept of describing which values can be passed to `fn` and which will crash.
JavaScript only truly provides dynamic typing - running the code to see what happens.

The alternative is to use a static type system to make predictions about what the code is expected to do before it runs.

## Static type-checking

Think back to that `TypeError` we got earlier from trying to call a `string` as a function.
 Most people don’t like to get any sorts of errors when running their code - those are considered bugs!
And when we write new code, we try our best to avoid introducing new bugs.

If we add just a bit of code, save our file, re-run the code, and immediately see the error, we might be able to isolate the problem quickly; but that’s not always the case.
We might not have tested the feature thoroughly enough, so we might never actually run into a potential error that would be thrown!
Or if we were lucky enough to witness the error, we might have ended up doing large refactorings and adding a lot of different code that we’re forced to dig through.

Ideally, we could have a tool that helps us find these bugs before our code runs.
That’s what a static type-checker like TypeScript does.
 Static type systems describe the shapes and behaviors of what our values will be when we run our programs.
A type-checker like TypeScript uses that information and tells us when things might be going off the rails.



```id
tsconst message = "hello!"; message();This expression is not callable.
  Type 'String' has no call signatures.2349This expression is not callable.
  Type 'String' has no call signatures.Try
```



Running that last sample with TypeScript will give us an error message before we run the code in the first place.

## Non-exception Failures

So far we’ve been discussing certain things like runtime errors - cases where the JavaScript runtime tells us that it thinks something is nonsensical.
Those cases come up because the ECMAScript specification has explicit instructions on how the language should behave when it runs into something unexpected.

For example, the specification says that trying to call something that isn’t callable should throw an error.
Maybe that sounds like “obvious behavior”, but you could imagine that accessing a property that doesn’t exist on an object should throw an error too.
Instead, JavaScript gives us different behavior and returns the value `undefined`:



```id
jsconst user = {  name: "Daniel",  age: 26,};user.location; // returns undefined
```



Ultimately, a static type system has to make the call over what code should be flagged as an error in its system, even if it’s “valid” JavaScript that won’t immediately throw an error.
In TypeScript, the following code produces an error about `location` not being defined:



```id
tsconst user = {  name: "Daniel",  age: 26,}; user.location;Property 'location' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.2339Property 'location' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.Try
```



While sometimes that implies a trade-off in what you can express, the intent is to catch legitimate bugs in our programs.
And TypeScript catches a lot of legitimate bugs.

For example: typos,



```id
tsconst announcement = "Hello World!"; // How quickly can you spot the typos?announcement.toLocaleLowercase();announcement.toLocalLowerCase(); // We probably meant to write this...announcement.toLocaleLowerCase();Try
```



uncalled functions,



```id
tsfunction flipCoin() {  // Meant to be Math.random()  return Math.random < 0.5;Operator '<' cannot be applied to types '() => number' and 'number'.2365Operator '<' cannot be applied to types '() => number' and 'number'.}Try
```



or basic logic errors.



```id
tsconst value = Math.random() < 0.5 ? "a" : "b";if (value !== "a") {  // ...} else if (value === "b") {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"a"' and '"b"' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"a"' and '"b"' have no overlap.  // Oops, unreachable}Try
```



## Types for Tooling

TypeScript can catch bugs when we make mistakes in our code.
That’s great, but TypeScript can also prevent us from making those mistakes in the first place.

The type-checker has information to check things like whether we’re accessing the right properties on variables and other properties.
Once it has that information, it can also start suggesting which properties you might want to use.

That means TypeScript can be leveraged for editing code too, and the core type-checker can provide error messages and code completion as you type in the editor.
That’s part of what people often refer to when they talk about tooling in TypeScript.

 


```id
tsimport express from "express";const app = express(); app.>.get: <"/", {}, any, any, QueryString.ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>(path: "/", ...handlers: RequestHandler<{}, any, any, QueryString.ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>[]) => Express (+5 overloads)' >get("/", function (>' >req, , number>' >res) {  , number>' >res.sen
sendsendDatesendfilesendFilesendStatus}); app.>.listen(port: number, callback?: () => void): Server (+5 overloads)' >listen(3000);Try
```



TypeScript takes tooling seriously, and that goes beyond completions and errors as you type.
An editor that supports TypeScript can deliver “quick fixes” to automatically fix errors, refactorings to easily re-organize code, and useful navigation features for jumping to definitions of a variable, or finding all references to a given variable.
All of this is built on top of the type-checker and is fully cross-platform, so it’s likely that your favorite editor has TypeScript support available .

## `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler

We’ve been talking about type-checking, but we haven’t yet used our type- checker .
Let’s get acquainted with our new friend `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler.
First we’ll need to grab it via npm.



```id
shnpm install -g typescript
```


 

This installs the TypeScript Compiler `tsc` globally.
You can use `npx` or similar tools if you’d prefer to run `tsc` from a local `node_modules` package instead.

 

Now let’s move to an empty folder and try writing our first TypeScript program: `hello.ts`:



```id
ts// Greets the world.console.log("Hello world!");Try
```



Notice there are no frills here; this “hello world” program looks identical to what you’d write for a “hello world” program in JavaScript.
And now let’s type-check it by running the command `tsc` which was installed for us by the `typescript` package.



```id
shtsc hello.ts
```



Tada!

Wait, “tada” what exactly?
We ran `tsc` and nothing happened!
Well, there were no type errors, so we didn’t get any output in our console since there was nothing to report.

But check again - we got some file output instead.
If we look in our current directory, we’ll see a `hello.js` file next to `hello.ts`.
That’s the output from our `hello.ts` file after `tsc` compiles or transforms it into a plain JavaScript file.
And if we check the contents, we’ll see what TypeScript spits out after it processes a `.ts` file:



```id
js// Greets the world.console.log("Hello world!");
```



In this case, there was very little for TypeScript to transform, so it looks identical to what we wrote.
The compiler tries to emit clean readable code that looks like something a person would write.
While that’s not always so easy, TypeScript indents consistently, is mindful of when our code spans across different lines of code, and tries to keep comments around.

What about if we did introduce a type-checking error?
Let’s rewrite `hello.ts`:



```id
ts// This is an industrial-grade general-purpose greeter function:function greet(person, date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date}!`);} greet("Brendan");Try
```



If we run `tsc hello.ts` again, notice that we get an error on the command line!



```id
txtExpected 2 arguments, but got 1.
```



TypeScript is telling us we forgot to pass an argument to the `greet` function, and rightfully so.
So far we’ve only written standard JavaScript, and yet type-checking was still able to find problems with our code.
Thanks TypeScript!

## Emitting with Errors

One thing you might not have noticed from the last example was that our `hello.js` file changed again.
If we open that file up then we’ll see that the contents still basically look the same as our input file.
That might be a bit surprising given the fact that `tsc` reported an error about our code, but this is based on one of TypeScript’s core values: much of the time, you will know better than TypeScript.

To reiterate from earlier, type-checking code limits the sorts of programs you can run, and so there’s a tradeoff on what sorts of things a type-checker finds acceptable.
Most of the time that’s okay, but there are scenarios where those checks get in the way.
For example, imagine yourself migrating JavaScript code over to TypeScript and introducing type-checking errors.
Eventually you’ll get around to cleaning things up for the type-checker, but that original JavaScript code was already working!
Why should converting it over to TypeScript stop you from running it?

So TypeScript doesn’t get in your way.
Of course, over time, you may want to be a bit more defensive against mistakes, and make TypeScript act a bit more strictly.
In that case, you can use the `noEmitOnError` compiler option.
Try changing your `hello.ts` file and running `tsc` with that flag:



```id
shtsc --noEmitOnError hello.ts
```



You’ll notice that `hello.js` never gets updated.

## Explicit Types

Up until now, we haven’t told TypeScript what `person` or `date` are.
Let’s edit the code to tell TypeScript that `person` is a `string`, and that `date` should be a `Date` object.
We’ll also use the `toDateString()` method on `date`.



```id
tsfunction greet(person: string, date: Date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);}Try
```



What we did was add type annotations on `person` and `date` to describe what types of values `greet` can be called with.
You can read that signature as ”`greet` takes a `person` of type `string`, and a `date` of type `Date`“.

With this, TypeScript can tell us about other cases where `greet` might have been called incorrectly.
For example…



```id
tsfunction greet(person: string, date: Date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);} greet("Maddison",  string' >Date());Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Date'.2345Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Date'.Try
```



Huh?
TypeScript reported an error on our second argument, but why?

Perhaps surprisingly, calling `Date()` in JavaScript returns a `string`.
On the other hand, constructing a `Date` with `new Date()` actually gives us what we were expecting.

Anyway, we can quickly fix up the error:



```id
tsfunction greet(person: string, date: Date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);} greet("Maddison", new  Date (+4 overloads)' >Date());Try
```



Keep in mind, we don’t always have to write explicit type annotations.
In many cases, TypeScript can even just infer (or “figure out”) the types for us even if we omit them.



```id
tslet msg = "hello there!";    let msg: stringTry
```



Even though we didn’t tell TypeScript that `msg` had the type `string` it was able to figure that out.
That’s a feature, and it’s best not to add annotations when the type system would end up inferring the same type anyway.

 

Note: The message bubble inside the previous code sample is what your editor would show if you had hovered over the word.

 

## Erased Types

Let’s take a look at what happens when we compile the above function `greet` with `tsc` to output JavaScript:



```id
ts"use strict";function greet(person, date) {    console.log("Hello ".concat(person, ", today is ").concat(date.toDateString(), "!"));}greet("Maddison", new Date()); Try
```



Notice two things here:

- Our `person` and `date` parameters no longer have type annotations.

- Our “template string” - that string that used backticks (the ``` character) - was converted to plain strings with concatenations.

More on that second point later, but let’s now focus on that first point.
Type annotations aren’t part of JavaScript (or ECMAScript to be pedantic), so there really aren’t any browsers or other runtimes that can just run TypeScript unmodified.
That’s why TypeScript needs a compiler in the first place - it needs some way to strip out or transform any TypeScript-specific code so that you can run it.
Most TypeScript-specific code gets erased away, and likewise, here our type annotations were completely erased.

 

 Remember : Type annotations never change the runtime behavior of your program.

 

## Downleveling

One other difference from the above was that our template string was rewritten from



```id
js`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`;
```



to



```id
js"Hello ".concat(person, ", today is ").concat(date.toDateString(), "!");
```



Why did this happen?

Template strings are a feature from a version of ECMAScript called ECMAScript 2015 (a.k.a. ECMAScript 6, ES2015, ES6, etc. - don’t ask ).
TypeScript has the ability to rewrite code from newer versions of ECMAScript to older ones such as ECMAScript 3 or ECMAScript 5 (a.k.a. ES5).
This process of moving from a newer or “higher” version of ECMAScript down to an older or “lower” one is sometimes called downleveling .

By default TypeScript targets ES5, an extremely old version of ECMAScript.
We could have chosen something a little bit more recent by using the `target` option.
Running with `--target es2015` changes TypeScript to target ECMAScript 2015, meaning code should be able to run wherever ECMAScript 2015 is supported.
So running `tsc --target es2015 hello.ts` gives us the following output:



```id
jsfunction greet(person, date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);}greet("Maddison", new Date());
```


 

While the default target is ES5, the great majority of current browsers support ES2015.
Most developers can therefore safely specify ES2015 or above as a target, unless compatibility with certain ancient browsers is important.

 

## Strictness

Different users come to TypeScript looking for different things in a type-checker.
Some people are looking for a more loose opt-in experience which can help validate only some parts of their program, and still have decent tooling.
This is the default experience with TypeScript, where types are optional, inference takes the most lenient types, and there’s no checking for potentially `null`/`undefined` values.
Much like how `tsc` emits in the face of errors, these defaults are put in place to stay out of your way.
If you’re migrating existing JavaScript, that might be a desirable first step.

In contrast, a lot of users prefer to have TypeScript validate as much as it can straight away, and that’s why the language provides strictness settings as well.
These strictness settings turn static type-checking from a switch (either your code is checked or not) into something closer to a dial.
The further you turn this dial up, the more TypeScript will check for you.
This can require a little extra work, but generally speaking it pays for itself in the long run, and enables more thorough checks and more accurate tooling.
When possible, a new codebase should always turn these strictness checks on.

TypeScript has several type-checking strictness flags that can be turned on or off, and all of our examples will be written with all of them enabled unless otherwise stated.
The `strict` flag in the CLI, or `"strict": true` in a `tsconfig.json` toggles them all on simultaneously, but we can opt out of them individually.
The two biggest ones you should know about are `noImplicitAny` and `strictNullChecks` .

## `noImplicitAny`

Recall that in some places, TypeScript doesn’t try to infer types for us and instead falls back to the most lenient type: `any`.
This isn’t the worst thing that can happen - after all, falling back to `any` is just the plain JavaScript experience anyway.

However, using `any` often defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place.
The more typed your program is, the more validation and tooling you’ll get, meaning you’ll run into fewer bugs as you code.
Turning on the `noImplicitAny` flag will issue an error on any variables whose type is implicitly inferred as `any`.

## `strictNullChecks`

By default, values like `null` and `undefined` are assignable to any other type.
This can make writing some code easier, but forgetting to handle `null` and `undefined` is the cause of countless bugs in the world - some consider it a billion dollar mistake !
The `strictNullChecks` flag makes handling `null` and `undefined` more explicit, and spares us from worrying about whether we forgot to handle `null` and `undefined`.

# Everyday Types

 

In this chapter, we’ll cover some of the most common types of values you’ll find in JavaScript code, and explain the corresponding ways to describe those types in TypeScript.
This isn’t an exhaustive list, and future chapters will describe more ways to name and use other types.

Types can also appear in many more places than just type annotations.
As we learn about the types themselves, we’ll also learn about the places where we can refer to these types to form new constructs.

We’ll start by reviewing the most basic and common types you might encounter when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code.
These will later form the core building blocks of more complex types.

## The primitives: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`

JavaScript has three very commonly used primitives : `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript.
As you might expect, these are the same names you’d see if you used the JavaScript `typeof` operator on a value of those types:

 `string` represents string values like `"Hello, world"`

- `number` is for numbers like `42`. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there’s no equivalent to `int` or `float` - everything is simply `number`

- `boolean` is for the two values `true` and `false`

 

The type names `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code. Always use `string`, `number`, or `boolean` for types.

 

## Arrays

To specify the type of an array like `[1, 2, 3]`, you can use the syntax `number[]`; this syntax works for any type (e.g. `string[]` is an array of strings, and so on).
You may also see this written as `Array `, which means the same thing.
We’ll learn more about the syntax `T ` when we cover generics .

 

Note that `[number]` is a different thing; refer to the section on Tuples .

 

## `any`

TypeScript also has a special type, `any`, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

When a value is of type `any`, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type `any`), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal:



```id
tslet obj: any = { x: 0 };// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed// you know the environment better than TypeScript.obj.foo();obj();obj.bar = 100;obj = "hello";const n: number = obj;Try
```



The `any` type is useful when you don’t want to write out a long type just to convince TypeScript that a particular line of code is okay.

### `noImplicitAny`

When you don’t specify a type, and TypeScript can’t infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to `any`.

You usually want to avoid this, though, because `any` isn’t type-checked.
Use the compiler flag `noImplicitAny` to flag any implicit `any` as an error.

## Type Annotations on Variables

When you declare a variable using `const`, `var`, or `let`, you can optionally add a type annotation to explicitly specify the type of the variable:



```id
tslet myName: string = "Alice";Try
```


 

TypeScript doesn’t use “types on the left”-style declarations like `int x = 0;`
Type annotations will always go after the thing being typed.

 

In most cases, though, this isn’t needed.
Wherever possible, TypeScript tries to automatically infer the types in your code.
For example, the type of a variable is inferred based on the type of its initializer:



```id
ts// No type annotation needed -- &apos;myName&apos; inferred as type &apos;string&apos;let myName = "Alice";Try
```



For the most part you don’t need to explicitly learn the rules of inference.
If you’re starting out, try using fewer type annotations than you think - you might be surprised how few you need for TypeScript to fully understand what’s going on.

## Functions

Functions are the primary means of passing data around in JavaScript.
TypeScript allows you to specify the types of both the input and output values of functions.

### Parameter Type Annotations

When you declare a function, you can add type annotations after each parameter to declare what types of parameters the function accepts.
Parameter type annotations go after the parameter name:



```id
ts// Parameter type annotationfunction greet(name: string) {  console.log("Hello, " + name.toUpperCase() + "!!");}Try
```



When a parameter has a type annotation, arguments to that function will be checked:



```id
ts// Would be a runtime error if executed!greet(42);Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.2345Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.Try
```


 

Even if you don’t have type annotations on your parameters, TypeScript will still check that you passed the right number of arguments.

 

### Return Type Annotations

You can also add return type annotations.
Return type annotations appear after the parameter list:



```id
tsfunction getFavoriteNumber(): number {  return 26;}Try
```



Much like variable type annotations, you usually don’t need a return type annotation because TypeScript will infer the function’s return type based on its `return` statements.
The type annotation in the above example doesn’t change anything.
Some codebases will explicitly specify a return type for documentation purposes, to prevent accidental changes, or just for personal preference.

#### Functions Which Return Promises

If you want to annotate the return type of a function which returns a promise, you should use the `Promise` type:



```id
tsasync function ' >getFavoriteNumber(): ' >Promise<number> {  return 26;}Try
```



### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are a little bit different from function declarations.
When a function appears in a place where TypeScript can determine how it’s going to be called, the parameters of that function are automatically given types.

Here’s an example:



```id
tsconst names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]; // Contextual typing for function - parameter s inferred to have type stringnames..forEach(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach(function (s) {  console.log(s.toUpperCase());}); // Contextual typing also applies to arrow functionsnames..forEach(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((s) => {  console.log(s.toUpperCase());});Try
```



Even though the parameter `s` didn’t have a type annotation, TypeScript used the types of the `forEach` function, along with the inferred type of the array, to determine the type `s` will have.

This process is called contextual typing because the context that the function occurred within informs what type it should have.

Similar to the inference rules, you don’t need to explicitly learn how this happens, but understanding that it does happen can help you notice when type annotations aren’t needed.
Later, we’ll see more examples of how the context that a value occurs in can affect its type.

## Object Types

Apart from primitives, the most common sort of type you’ll encounter is an object type .
This refers to any JavaScript value with properties, which is almost all of them!
To define an object type, we simply list its properties and their types.

For example, here’s a function that takes a point-like object:



```id
ts// The parameter&apos;s type annotation is an object typefunction printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s x value is " + pt.x);  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s y value is " + pt.y);}printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });Try
```



Here, we annotated the parameter with a type with two properties - `x` and `y` - which are both of type `number`.
You can use `,` or `;` to separate the properties, and the last separator is optional either way.

The type part of each property is also optional.
If you don’t specify a type, it will be assumed to be `any`.

### Optional Properties

Object types can also specify that some or all of their properties are optional .
To do this, add a `?` after the property name:



```id
tsfunction printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {  // ...}// Both OKprintName({ first: "Bob" });printName({ first: "Alice", last: "Alisson" });Try
```



In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn’t exist, you’ll get the value `undefined` rather than a runtime error.
Because of this, when you read from an optional property, you’ll have to check for `undefined` before using it.



```id
tsfunction printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {  // Error - might crash if &apos;obj.last&apos; wasn&apos;t provided!  console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());'obj.last' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'obj.last' is possibly 'undefined'.  if (obj.last !== undefined) {    // OK    console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());  }   // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax:  console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());}Try
```



## Union Types

TypeScript’s type system allows you to build new types out of existing ones using a large variety of operators.
Now that we know how to write a few types, it’s time to start combining them in interesting ways.

### Defining a Union Type

The first way to combine types you might see is a union type.
A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types.
We refer to each of these types as the union’s members .

Let’s write a function that can operate on strings or numbers:



```id
tsfunction printId(id: number | string) {  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);}// OKprintId(101);// OKprintId("202");// ErrorprintId({ myID: 22342 });Argument of type '{ myID: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.2345Argument of type '{ myID: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.Try
```


 

The separator of the union members is allowed before the first element, so you could also write this:



```id
tsfunction printTextOrNumberOrBool(  textOrNumberOrBool:    | string    | number    | boolean) {  console.log(textOrNumberOrBool);}Try
```


 

### Working with Union Types

It’s easy to provide a value matching a union type - simply provide a type matching any of the union’s members.
If you have a value of a union type, how do you work with it?

TypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for every member of the union.
For example, if you have the union `string | number`, you can’t use methods that are only available on `string`:



```id
tsfunction printId(id: number | string) {  console.log(id.toUpperCase());Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.2339Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.}Try
```



The solution is to narrow the union with code, the same as you would in JavaScript without type annotations.
 Narrowing occurs when TypeScript can deduce a more specific type for a value based on the structure of the code.

For example, TypeScript knows that only a `string` value will have a `typeof` value `"string"`:



```id
tsfunction printId(id: number | string) {  if (typeof id === "string") {    // In this branch, id is of type &apos;string&apos;    console.log(id.toUpperCase());  } else {    // Here, id is of type &apos;number&apos;    console.log(id);  }}Try
```



Another example is to use a function like `Array.isArray`:



```id
tsfunction welcomePeople(x: string[] | string) {  if (Array.isArray(x)) {    // Here: &apos;x&apos; is &apos;string[]&apos;    console.log("Hello, " + x..join(separator?: string): string' >join(" and "));  } else {    // Here: &apos;x&apos; is &apos;string&apos;    console.log("Welcome lone traveler " + x);  }}Try
```



Notice that in the `else` branch, we don’t need to do anything special - if `x` wasn’t a `string[]`, then it must have been a `string`.

Sometimes you’ll have a union where all the members have something in common.
For example, both arrays and strings have a `slice` method.
If every member in a union has a property in common, you can use that property without narrowing:



```id
ts// Return type is inferred as number[] | stringfunction getFirstThree(x: number[] | string) {  return x.slice(0, 3);}Try
```


 

It might be confusing that a union of types appears to have the intersection of those types’ properties.
This is not an accident - the name union comes from type theory.
The union `number | string` is composed by taking the union of the values from each type.
Notice that given two sets with corresponding facts about each set, only the intersection of those facts applies to the union of the sets themselves.
For example, if we had a room of tall people wearing hats, and another room of Spanish speakers wearing hats, after combining those rooms, the only thing we know about every person is that they must be wearing a hat.

 

## Type Aliases

We’ve been using object types and union types by writing them directly in type annotations.
This is convenient, but it’s common to want to use the same type more than once and refer to it by a single name.

A type alias is exactly that - a name for any type .
The syntax for a type alias is:



```id
tstype Point = {  x: number;  y: number;}; // Exactly the same as the earlier examplefunction printCoord(pt: Point) {  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s x value is " + pt.x);  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s y value is " + pt.y);} printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });Try
```



You can actually use a type alias to give a name to any type at all, not just an object type.
For example, a type alias can name a union type:



```id
tstype ID = number | string;Try
```



Note that aliases are only aliases - you cannot use type aliases to create different/distinct “versions” of the same type.
When you use the alias, it’s exactly as if you had written the aliased type.
In other words, this code might look illegal, but is OK according to TypeScript because both types are aliases for the same type:



```id
tstype UserInputSanitizedString = string; function sanitizeInput(str: string): UserInputSanitizedString {  return sanitize(str);} // Create a sanitized inputlet userInput = sanitizeInput(getInput()); // Can still be re-assigned with a string thoughuserInput = "new input";Try
```



## Interfaces

An interface declaration is another way to name an object type:



```id
tsinterface Point {  x: number;  y: number;} function printCoord(pt: Point) {  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s x value is " + pt.x);  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s y value is " + pt.y);} printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });Try
```



Just like when we used a type alias above, the example works just as if we had used an anonymous object type.
TypeScript is only concerned with the structure of the value we passed to `printCoord` - it only cares that it has the expected properties.
Being concerned only with the structure and capabilities of types is why we call TypeScript a structurally typed type system.

### Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces

Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely.
Almost all features of an `interface` are available in `type`, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

 
 
 
 
 `Interface` 
 `Type` 
 
 
 
 

Extending an interface


 `

```
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Bear extends Animal {
  honey: boolean;
}

const bear = getBear();
bear.name;
bear.honey;
```

`
 
 
 

Extending a type via intersections


 `

```
type Animal = {
  name: string;
}

type Bear = Animal & { 
  honey: boolean;
}

const bear = getBear();
bear.name;
bear.honey;
```

`
 
 
 
 
 

Adding new fields to an existing interface


 `

```
interface Window {
  title: string;
}

interface Window {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}

const src = 'const a = "Hello World"';
window.ts.transpileModule(src, {});
```

`
 
 
 

A type cannot be changed after being created


 `

```
type Window = {
  title: string;
}

type Window = {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}

 // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Window'.
```

`
 
 
 
 
 

You’ll learn more about these concepts in later chapters, so don’t worry if you don’t understand all of these right away.

- Prior to TypeScript version 4.2, type alias names may appear in error messages , sometimes in place of the equivalent anonymous type (which may or may not be desirable). Interfaces will always be named in error messages.

- Type aliases may not participate in declaration merging, but interfaces can .

- Interfaces may only be used to declare the shapes of objects, not rename primitives .

- Interface names will always appear in their original form in error messages, but only when they are used by name.

- Using interfaces with `extends` can often be more performant for the compiler than type aliases with intersections

For the most part, you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will tell you if it needs something to be the other kind of declaration. If you would like a heuristic, use `interface` until you need to use features from `type`.

## Type Assertions

Sometimes you will have information about the type of a value that TypeScript can’t know about.

For example, if you’re using `document.getElementById`, TypeScript only knows that this will return some kind of `HTMLElement`, but you might know that your page will always have an `HTMLCanvasElement` with a given ID.

In this situation, you can use a type assertion to specify a more specific type:



```id
tsconst myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;Try
```



Like a type annotation, type assertions are removed by the compiler and won’t affect the runtime behavior of your code.

You can also use the angle-bracket syntax (except if the code is in a `.tsx` file), which is equivalent:



```id
tsconst myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");Try
```


 

Reminder: Because type assertions are removed at compile-time, there is no runtime checking associated with a type assertion.
There won’t be an exception or `null` generated if the type assertion is wrong.

 

TypeScript only allows type assertions which convert to a more specific or less specific version of a type.
This rule prevents “impossible” coercions like:



```id
tsconst x = "hello" as number;Conversion of type 'string' to type 'number' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.2352Conversion of type 'string' to type 'number' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.Try
```



Sometimes this rule can be too conservative and will disallow more complex coercions that might be valid.
If this happens, you can use two assertions, first to `any` (or `unknown`, which we’ll introduce later), then to the desired type:



```id
tsconst a = expr as any as T;Try
```



## Literal Types

In addition to the general types `string` and `number`, we can refer to specific strings and numbers in type positions.

One way to think about this is to consider how JavaScript comes with different ways to declare a variable. Both `var` and `let` allow for changing what is held inside the variable, and `const` does not. This is reflected in how TypeScript creates types for literals.



```id
tslet changingString = "Hello World";changingString = "Olá Mundo";// Because `changingString` can represent any possible string, that// is how TypeScript describes it in the type systemchangingString;      let changingString: string const constantString = "Hello World";// Because `constantString` can only represent 1 possible string, it// has a literal type representationconstantString;      const constantString: "Hello World"Try
```



By themselves, literal types aren’t very valuable:



```id
tslet x: "hello" = "hello";// OKx = "hello";// ...x = "howdy";Type '"howdy"' is not assignable to type '"hello"'.2322Type '"howdy"' is not assignable to type '"hello"'.Try
```



It’s not much use to have a variable that can only have one value!

But by combining literals into unions, you can express a much more useful concept - for example, functions that only accept a certain set of known values:



```id
tsfunction printText(s: string, alignment: "left" | "right" | "center") {  // ...}printText("Hello, world", "left");printText("G&apos;day, mate", "centre");Argument of type '"centre"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right" | "center"'.2345Argument of type '"centre"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right" | "center"'.Try
```



Numeric literal types work the same way:



```id
tsfunction compare(a: string, b: string): -1 | 0 | 1 {  return a === b ? 0 : a > b ? 1 : -1;}Try
```



Of course, you can combine these with non-literal types:



```id
tsinterface Options {  width: number;}function configure(x: Options | "auto") {  // ...}configure({ width: 100 });configure("auto");configure("automatic");Argument of type '"automatic"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Options | "auto"'.2345Argument of type '"automatic"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Options | "auto"'.Try
```



There’s one more kind of literal type: boolean literals.
There are only two boolean literal types, and as you might guess, they are the types `true` and `false`.
The type `boolean` itself is actually just an alias for the union `true | false`.

### Literal Inference

When you initialize a variable with an object, TypeScript assumes that the properties of that object might change values later.
For example, if you wrote code like this:



```id
tsconst obj = { counter: 0 };if (someCondition) {  obj.counter = 1;}Try
```



TypeScript doesn’t assume the assignment of `1` to a field which previously had `0` is an error.
Another way of saying this is that `obj.counter` must have the type `number`, not `0`, because types are used to determine both reading and writing behavior.

The same applies to strings:



```id
tsdeclare function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void; const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" };handleRequest(req.url, req.method);Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"GET" | "POST"'.2345Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"GET" | "POST"'.Try
```



In the above example `req.method` is inferred to be `string`, not `"GET"`. Because code can be evaluated between the creation of `req` and the call of `handleRequest` which could assign a new string like `"GUESS"` to `req.method`, TypeScript considers this code to have an error.

There are two ways to work around this.

- 

You can change the inference by adding a type assertion in either location:



```id
ts// Change 1:const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" as "GET" };// Change 2handleRequest(req.url, req.method as "GET");Try
```



Change 1 means “I intend for `req.method` to always have the literal type `"GET"`”, preventing the possible assignment of `"GUESS"` to that field after.
Change 2 means “I know for other reasons that `req.method` has the value `"GET"`“.

- 

You can use `as const` to convert the entire object to be type literals:



```id
tsconst req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" } as const;handleRequest(req.url, req.method);Try
```



The `as const` suffix acts like `const` but for the type system, ensuring that all properties are assigned the literal type instead of a more general version like `string` or `number`.

## `null` and `undefined`

JavaScript has two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value: `null` and `undefined`.

TypeScript has two corresponding types by the same names. How these types behave depends on whether you have the `strictNullChecks` option on.

### `strictNullChecks` off

With `strictNullChecks` off , values that might be `null` or `undefined` can still be accessed normally, and the values `null` and `undefined` can be assigned to a property of any type.
This is similar to how languages without null checks (e.g. C#, Java) behave.
The lack of checking for these values tends to be a major source of bugs; we always recommend people turn `strictNullChecks` on if it’s practical to do so in their codebase.

### `strictNullChecks` on

With `strictNullChecks` on , when a value is `null` or `undefined`, you will need to test for those values before using methods or properties on that value.
Just like checking for `undefined` before using an optional property, we can use narrowing to check for values that might be `null`:



```id
tsfunction doSomething(x: string | null) {  if (x === null) {    // do nothing  } else {    console.log("Hello, " + x.toUpperCase());  }}Try
```



### Non-null Assertion Operator (Postfix `!`)

TypeScript also has a special syntax for removing `null` and `undefined` from a type without doing any explicit checking.
Writing `!` after any expression is effectively a type assertion that the value isn’t `null` or `undefined`:



```id
tsfunction liveDangerously(x?: number | null) {  // No error  console.log(x!.toFixed());}Try
```



Just like other type assertions, this doesn’t change the runtime behavior of your code, so it’s important to only use `!` when you know that the value can’t be `null` or `undefined`.

## Enums

Enums are a feature added to JavaScript by TypeScript which allows for describing a value which could be one of a set of possible named constants. Unlike most TypeScript features, this is not a type-level addition to JavaScript but something added to the language and runtime. Because of this, it’s a feature which you should know exists, but maybe hold off on using unless you are sure. You can read more about enums in the Enum reference page .

## Less Common Primitives

It’s worth mentioning the rest of the primitives in JavaScript which are represented in the type system.
Though we will not go into depth here.

#### `bigint`

From ES2020 onwards, there is a primitive in JavaScript used for very large integers, `BigInt`:



```id
ts// Creating a bigint via the BigInt functionconst oneHundred: bigint =  bigint' >BigInt(100); // Creating a BigInt via the literal syntaxconst anotherHundred: bigint = 100n;Try
```



You can learn more about BigInt in the TypeScript 3.2 release notes .

#### `symbol`

There is a primitive in JavaScript used to create a globally unique reference via the function `Symbol()`:



```id
tsconst firstName =  symbol' >Symbol("name");const secondName =  symbol' >Symbol("name"); if (firstName === secondName) {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof firstName' and 'typeof secondName' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof firstName' and 'typeof secondName' have no overlap.  // Can&apos;t ever happen}Try
```



You can learn more about them in Symbols reference page .

Over 20 years after its introduction to the programming community, JavaScript is now one of the most widespread cross-platform languages ever created. Starting as a small scripting language for adding trivial interactivity to webpages, JavaScript has grown to be a language of choice for both frontend and backend applications of every size. While the size, scope, and complexity of programs written in JavaScript has grown exponentially, the ability of the JavaScript language to express the relationships between different units of code has not. Combined with JavaScript’s rather peculiar runtime semantics, this mismatch between language and program complexity has made JavaScript development a difficult task to manage at scale.

The most common kinds of errors that programmers write can be described as type errors: a certain kind of value was used where a different kind of value was expected. This could be due to simple typos, a failure to understand the API surface of a library, incorrect assumptions about runtime behavior, or other errors. The goal of TypeScript is to be a static typechecker for JavaScript programs - in other words, a tool that runs before your code runs (static) and ensures that the types of the program are correct (typechecked).

If you are coming to TypeScript without a JavaScript background, with the intention of TypeScript being your first language, we recommend you first start reading the documentation on either the Microsoft Learn JavaScript tutorial or read JavaScript at the Mozilla Web Docs .
If you have experience in other languages, you should be able to pick up JavaScript syntax quite quickly by reading the handbook.

## How is this Handbook Structured

The handbook is split into two sections:

 

 The Handbook 

The TypeScript Handbook is intended to be a comprehensive document that explains TypeScript to everyday programmers. You can read the handbook by going from top to bottom in the left-hand navigation.

You should expect each chapter or page to provide you with a strong understanding of the given concepts. The TypeScript Handbook is not a complete language specification, but it is intended to be a comprehensive guide to all of the language’s features and behaviors.

A reader who completes the walkthrough should be able to:

 Read and understand commonly-used TypeScript syntax and patterns

- Explain the effects of important compiler options

- Correctly predict type system behavior in most cases

In the interests of clarity and brevity, the main content of the Handbook will not explore every edge case or minutiae of the features being covered. You can find more details on particular concepts in the reference articles.

 
- 

 Reference Files 

The reference section below the handbook in the navigation is built to provide a richer understanding of how a particular part of TypeScript works. You can read it top-to-bottom, but each section aims to provide a deeper explanation of a single concept - meaning there is no aim for continuity.

### Non-Goals

The Handbook is also intended to be a concise document that can be comfortably read in a few hours. Certain topics won’t be covered in order to keep things short.

Specifically, the Handbook does not fully introduce core JavaScript basics like functions, classes, and closures. Where appropriate, we’ll include links to background reading that you can use to read up on those concepts.

The Handbook also isn’t intended to be a replacement for a language specification. In some cases, edge cases or formal descriptions of behavior will be skipped in favor of high-level, easier-to-understand explanations. Instead, there are separate reference pages that more precisely and formally describe many aspects of TypeScript’s behavior. The reference pages are not intended for readers unfamiliar with TypeScript, so they may use advanced terminology or reference topics you haven’t read about yet.

Finally, the Handbook won’t cover how TypeScript interacts with other tools, except where necessary. Topics like how to configure TypeScript with webpack, rollup, parcel, react, babel, closure, lerna, rush, bazel, preact, vue, angular, svelte, jquery, yarn, or npm are out of scope - you can find these resources elsewhere on the web.

## Get Started

Before getting started with The Basics , we recommend reading one of the following introductory pages. These introductions are intended to highlight key similarities and differences between TypeScript and your favored programming language, and clear up common misconceptions specific to those languages.

- TypeScript for the New Programmer 

- TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers 

- TypeScript for Java/C# Programmers 

- TypeScript for Functional Programmers 

Otherwise, jump to The Basics .

# Narrowing

 

Imagine we have a function called `padLeft`.



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {  throw new  Error' >Error("Not implemented yet!");}Try
```



If `padding` is a `number`, it will treat that as the number of spaces we want to prepend to `input`.
If `padding` is a `string`, it should just prepend `padding` to `input`.
Let’s try to implement the logic for when `padLeft` is passed a `number` for `padding`.



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {  return " ".repeat(padding) + input;Argument of type 'string | number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
  Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2345Argument of type 'string | number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
  Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.}Try
```



Uh-oh, we’re getting an error on `padding`.
TypeScript is warning us that we’re passing a value with type `number | string` to the `repeat` function, which only accepts a `number`, and it’s right.
In other words, we haven’t explicitly checked if `padding` is a `number` first, nor are we handling the case where it’s a `string`, so let’s do exactly that.



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {  if (typeof padding === "number") {    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;  }  return padding + input;}Try
```



If this mostly looks like uninteresting JavaScript code, that’s sort of the point.
Apart from the annotations we put in place, this TypeScript code looks like JavaScript.
The idea is that TypeScript’s type system aims to make it as easy as possible to write typical JavaScript code without bending over backwards to get type safety.

While it might not look like much, there’s actually a lot going on under the covers here.
Much like how TypeScript analyzes runtime values using static types, it overlays type analysis on JavaScript’s runtime control flow constructs like `if/else`, conditional ternaries, loops, truthiness checks, etc., which can all affect those types.

Within our `if` check, TypeScript sees `typeof padding === "number"` and understands that as a special form of code called a type guard .
TypeScript follows possible paths of execution that our programs can take to analyze the most specific possible type of a value at a given position.
It looks at these special checks (called type guards ) and assignments, and the process of refining types to more specific types than declared is called narrowing .
In many editors we can observe these types as they change, and we’ll even do so in our examples.



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {  if (typeof padding === "number") {    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;                        (parameter) padding: number  }  return padding + input;           (parameter) padding: string}Try
```



There are a couple of different constructs TypeScript understands for narrowing.

## `typeof` type guards

As we’ve seen, JavaScript supports a `typeof` operator which can give very basic information about the type of values we have at runtime.
TypeScript expects this to return a certain set of strings:

 `"string"`

- `"number"`

- `"bigint"`

- `"boolean"`

- `"symbol"`

- `"undefined"`

- `"object"`

- `"function"`

Like we saw with `padLeft`, this operator comes up pretty often in a number of JavaScript libraries, and TypeScript can understand it to narrow types in different branches.

In TypeScript, checking against the value returned by `typeof` is a type guard.
Because TypeScript encodes how `typeof` operates on different values, it knows about some of its quirks in JavaScript.
For example, notice that in the list above, `typeof` doesn’t return the string `null`.
Check out the following example:



```id
tsfunction printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {  if (typeof strs === "object") {    for (const s of strs) {'strs' is possibly 'null'.18047'strs' is possibly 'null'.      console.log(s);    }  } else if (typeof strs === "string") {    console.log(strs);  } else {    // do nothing  }}Try
```



In the `printAll` function, we try to check if `strs` is an object to see if it’s an array type (now might be a good time to reinforce that arrays are object types in JavaScript).
But it turns out that in JavaScript, `typeof null` is actually `"object"`!
This is one of those unfortunate accidents of history.

Users with enough experience might not be surprised, but not everyone has run into this in JavaScript; luckily, TypeScript lets us know that `strs` was only narrowed down to `string[] | null` instead of just `string[]`.

This might be a good segue into what we’ll call “truthiness” checking.

# Truthiness narrowing

Truthiness might not be a word you’ll find in the dictionary, but it’s very much something you’ll hear about in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, we can use any expression in conditionals, `&&`s, `||`s, `if` statements, Boolean negations (`!`), and more.
As an example, `if` statements don’t expect their condition to always have the type `boolean`.



```id
tsfunction getUsersOnlineMessage(numUsersOnline: number) {  if (numUsersOnline) {    return `There are ${numUsersOnline} online now!`;  }  return "Nobody&apos;s here. :(";}Try
```



In JavaScript, constructs like `if` first “coerce” their conditions to `boolean`s to make sense of them, and then choose their branches depending on whether the result is `true` or `false`.
Values like

- `0`

- `NaN`

- `""` (the empty string)

- `0n` (the `bigint` version of zero)

- `null`

- `undefined`

all coerce to `false`, and other values get coerced to `true`.
You can always coerce values to `boolean`s by running them through the `Boolean` function, or by using the shorter double-Boolean negation. (The latter has the advantage that TypeScript infers a narrow literal boolean type `true`, while inferring the first as type `boolean`.)



```id
ts// both of these result in &apos;true&apos;(value?: string | undefined) => boolean' >Boolean("hello"); // type: boolean, value: true!!"world"; // type: true,    value: trueThis kind of expression is always truthy.2872This kind of expression is always truthy.Try
```



It’s fairly popular to leverage this behavior, especially for guarding against values like `null` or `undefined`.
As an example, let’s try using it for our `printAll` function.



```id
tsfunction printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {  if (strs && typeof strs === "object") {    for (const s of strs) {      console.log(s);    }  } else if (typeof strs === "string") {    console.log(strs);  }}Try
```



You’ll notice that we’ve gotten rid of the error above by checking if `strs` is truthy.
This at least prevents us from dreaded errors when we run our code like:



```id
txtTypeError: null is not iterable
```



Keep in mind though that truthiness checking on primitives can often be error prone.
As an example, consider a different attempt at writing `printAll`



```id
tsfunction printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {  // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  //  DON&apos;T DO THIS!  //   KEEP READING  // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  if (strs) {    if (typeof strs === "object") {      for (const s of strs) {        console.log(s);      }    } else if (typeof strs === "string") {      console.log(strs);    }  }}Try
```



We wrapped the entire body of the function in a truthy check, but this has a subtle downside: we may no longer be handling the empty string case correctly.

TypeScript doesn’t hurt us here at all, but this behavior is worth noting if you’re less familiar with JavaScript.
TypeScript can often help you catch bugs early on, but if you choose to do nothing with a value, there’s only so much that it can do without being overly prescriptive.
If you want, you can make sure you handle situations like these with a linter.

One last word on narrowing by truthiness is that Boolean negations with `!` filter out from negated branches.



```id
tsfunction multiplyAll(  values: number[] | undefined,  factor: number): number[] | undefined {  if (!values) {    return values;  } else {    return values..map<number>(callbackfn: (value: number, index: number, array: number[]) => number, thisArg?: any): number[]' >map((x) => x * factor);  }}Try
```



## Equality narrowing

TypeScript also uses `switch` statements and equality checks like `===`, `!==`, `==`, and `!=` to narrow types.
For example:



```id
tsfunction example(x: string | number, y: string | boolean) {  if (x === y) {    // We can now call any &apos;string&apos; method on &apos;x&apos; or &apos;y&apos;.    x.toUpperCase();          (method) String.toUpperCase(): string    y.toLowerCase();          (method) String.toLowerCase(): string  } else {    console.log(x);               (parameter) x: string | number    console.log(y);               (parameter) y: string | boolean  }}Try
```



When we checked that `x` and `y` are both equal in the above example, TypeScript knew their types also had to be equal.
Since `string` is the only common type that both `x` and `y` could take on, TypeScript knows that `x` and `y` must be `string`s in the first branch.

Checking against specific literal values (as opposed to variables) works also.
In our section about truthiness narrowing, we wrote a `printAll` function which was error-prone because it accidentally didn’t handle empty strings properly.
Instead we could have done a specific check to block out `null`s, and TypeScript still correctly removes `null` from the type of `strs`.



```id
tsfunction printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {  if (strs !== null) {    if (typeof strs === "object") {      for (const s of strs) {                       (parameter) strs: string[]        console.log(s);      }    } else if (typeof strs === "string") {      console.log(strs);                   (parameter) strs: string    }  }}Try
```



JavaScript’s looser equality checks with `==` and `!=` also get narrowed correctly.
If you’re unfamiliar, checking whether something `== null` actually not only checks whether it is specifically the value `null` - it also checks whether it’s potentially `undefined`.
The same applies to `== undefined`: it checks whether a value is either `null` or `undefined`.



```id
tsinterface Container {  value: number | null | undefined;} function multiplyValue(container: Container, factor: number) {  // Remove both &apos;null&apos; and &apos;undefined&apos; from the type.  if (container.value != null) {    console.log(container.value);                           (property) Container.value: number     // Now we can safely multiply &apos;container.value&apos;.    container.value *= factor;  }}Try
```



## The `in` operator narrowing

JavaScript has an operator for determining if an object or its prototype chain has a property with a name: the `in` operator.
TypeScript takes this into account as a way to narrow down potential types.

For example, with the code: `"value" in x`. where `"value"` is a string literal and `x` is a union type.
The “true” branch narrows `x`’s types which have either an optional or required property `value`, and the “false” branch narrows to types which have an optional or missing property `value`.



```id
tstype  void;
}' >Fish = {  void' >swim: () => void };type  void;
}' >Bird = {  void' >fly: () => void }; function move(animal:  void;
}' >Fish |  void;
}' >Bird) {  if ("swim" in animal) {    return animal. void' >swim();  }   return animal. void' >fly();}Try
```



To reiterate, optional properties will exist in both sides for narrowing. For example, a human could both swim and fly (with the right equipment) and thus should show up in both sides of the `in` check:

 


```id
tstype  void;
}' >Fish = {  void' >swim: () => void };type  void;
}' >Bird = {  void' >fly: () => void };type  void;
    fly?: () => void;
}' >Human = {  void) | undefined' >swim?: () => void;  void) | undefined' >fly?: () => void }; function move(animal:  void;
}' >Fish |  void;
}' >Bird |  void;
    fly?: () => void;
}' >Human) {  if ("swim" in animal) {    animal;      (parameter) animal: Fish | Human  } else {    animal;      (parameter) animal: Bird | Human  }}Try
```



## `instanceof` narrowing

JavaScript has an operator for checking whether or not a value is an “instance” of another value.
More specifically, in JavaScript `x instanceof Foo` checks whether the prototype chain of `x` contains `Foo.prototype`.
While we won’t dive deep here, and you’ll see more of this when we get into classes, they can still be useful for most values that can be constructed with `new`.
As you might have guessed, `instanceof` is also a type guard, and TypeScript narrows in branches guarded by `instanceof`s.



```id
tsfunction logValue(x: Date | string) {  if (x instanceof Date) {    console.log(x.toUTCString());               (parameter) x: Date  } else {    console.log(x.toUpperCase());               (parameter) x: string  }}Try
```



## Assignments

As we mentioned earlier, when we assign to any variable, TypeScript looks at the right side of the assignment and narrows the left side appropriately.



```id
tslet x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 10 : "hello world!";   let x: string | numberx = 1; console.log(x);           let x: numberx = "goodbye!"; console.log(x);           let x: stringTry
```



Notice that each of these assignments is valid.
Even though the observed type of `x` changed to `number` after our first assignment, we were still able to assign a `string` to `x`.
This is because the declared type of `x` - the type that `x` started with - is `string | number`, and assignability is always checked against the declared type.

If we’d assigned a `boolean` to `x`, we’d have seen an error since that wasn’t part of the declared type.



```id
tslet x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 10 : "hello world!";   let x: string | numberx = 1; console.log(x);           let x: numberx = true;Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.2322Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'. console.log(x);           let x: string | numberTry
```



## Control flow analysis

Up until this point, we’ve gone through some basic examples of how TypeScript narrows within specific branches.
But there’s a bit more going on than just walking up from every variable and looking for type guards in `if`s, `while`s, conditionals, etc.
For example



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {  if (typeof padding === "number") {    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;  }  return padding + input;}Try
```



`padLeft` returns from within its first `if` block.
TypeScript was able to analyze this code and see that the rest of the body (`return padding + input;`) is unreachable in the case where `padding` is a `number`.
As a result, it was able to remove `number` from the type of `padding` (narrowing from `string | number` to `string`) for the rest of the function.

This analysis of code based on reachability is called control flow analysis , and TypeScript uses this flow analysis to narrow types as it encounters type guards and assignments.
When a variable is analyzed, control flow can split off and re-merge over and over again, and that variable can be observed to have a different type at each point.



```id
tsfunction example() {  let x: string | number | boolean;   x = Math.random() < 0.5;   console.log(x);             let x: boolean   if (Math.random() < 0.5) {    x = "hello";    console.log(x);               let x: string  } else {    x = 100;    console.log(x);               let x: number  }   return x;        let x: string | number}Try
```



## Using type predicates

We’ve worked with existing JavaScript constructs to handle narrowing so far, however sometimes you want more direct control over how types change throughout your code.

To define a user-defined type guard, we simply need to define a function whose return type is a type predicate :



```id
tsfunction isFish(pet:  void;
}' >Fish |  void;
}' >Bird): pet is  void;
}' >Fish {  return (pet as  void;
}' >Fish). void' >swim !== undefined;}Try
```



`pet is Fish` is our type predicate in this example.
A predicate takes the form `parameterName is Type`, where `parameterName` must be the name of a parameter from the current function signature.

Any time `isFish` is called with some variable, TypeScript will narrow that variable to that specific type if the original type is compatible.



```id
ts// Both calls to &apos;swim&apos; and &apos;fly&apos; are now okay.let pet = getSmallPet(); if (isFish(pet)) {  pet. void' >swim();} else {  pet. void' >fly();}Try
```



Notice that TypeScript not only knows that `pet` is a `Fish` in the `if` branch;
it also knows that in the `else` branch, you don’t have a `Fish`, so you must have a `Bird`.

You may use the type guard `isFish` to filter an array of `Fish | Bird` and obtain an array of `Fish`:



```id
tsconst zoo: ( void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish |  void;
    name: string;
}' >Bird)[] = [getSmallPet(), getSmallPet(), getSmallPet()];const underWater1:  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish[] = zoo..filter<Fish>(predicate: (value: Fish | Bird, index: number, array: (Fish | Bird)[]) => value is Fish, thisArg?: any): Fish[] (+1 overload)' >filter(isFish);// or, equivalentlyconst underWater2:  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish[] = zoo..filter<Fish>(predicate: (value: Fish | Bird, index: number, array: (Fish | Bird)[]) => value is Fish, thisArg?: any): Fish[] (+1 overload)' >filter(isFish) as  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish[]; // The predicate may need repeating for more complex examplesconst underWater3:  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish[] = zoo..filter<Fish>(predicate: (value: Fish | Bird, index: number, array: (Fish | Bird)[]) => value is Fish, thisArg?: any): Fish[] (+1 overload)' >filter((pet): pet is  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish => {  if (pet.name === "sharkey") return false;  return isFish(pet);});Try
```



In addition, classes can use `this is Type` to narrow their type.

## Assertion functions

Types can also be narrowed using Assertion functions .

# Discriminated unions

Most of the examples we’ve looked at so far have focused around narrowing single variables with simple types like `string`, `boolean`, and `number`.
While this is common, most of the time in JavaScript we’ll be dealing with slightly more complex structures.

For some motivation, let’s imagine we’re trying to encode shapes like circles and squares.
Circles keep track of their radiuses and squares keep track of their side lengths.
We’ll use a field called `kind` to tell which shape we’re dealing with.
Here’s a first attempt at defining `Shape`.



```id
tsinterface Shape {  kind: "circle" | "square";  radius?: number;  sideLength?: number;}Try
```



Notice we’re using a union of string literal types: `"circle"` and `"square"` to tell us whether we should treat the shape as a circle or square respectively.
By using `"circle" | "square"` instead of `string`, we can avoid misspelling issues.



```id
tsfunction handleShape(shape: Shape) {  // oops!  if (shape.kind === "rect") {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"circle" | "square"' and '"rect"' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"circle" | "square"' and '"rect"' have no overlap.    // ...  }}Try
```



We can write a `getArea` function that applies the right logic based on if it’s dealing with a circle or square.
We’ll first try dealing with circles.



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.}Try
```


 

Under `strictNullChecks` that gives us an error - which is appropriate since `radius` might not be defined.
But what if we perform the appropriate checks on the `kind` property?



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  if (shape.kind === "circle") {    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.  }}Try
```



Hmm, TypeScript still doesn’t know what to do here.
We’ve hit a point where we know more about our values than the type checker does.
We could try to use a non-null assertion (a `!` after `shape.radius`) to say that `radius` is definitely present.



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  if (shape.kind === "circle") {    return Math.PI * shape.radius! ** 2;  }}Try
```



But this doesn’t feel ideal.
We had to shout a bit at the type-checker with those non-null assertions (`!`) to convince it that `shape.radius` was defined, but those assertions are error-prone if we start to move code around.
Additionally, outside of `strictNullChecks` we’re able to accidentally access any of those fields anyway (since optional properties are just assumed to always be present when reading them).
We can definitely do better.

The problem with this encoding of `Shape` is that the type-checker doesn’t have any way to know whether or not `radius` or `sideLength` are present based on the `kind` property.
We need to communicate what we know to the type checker.
With that in mind, let’s take another swing at defining `Shape`.



```id
tsinterface Circle {  kind: "circle";  radius: number;} interface Square {  kind: "square";  sideLength: number;} type Shape = Circle | Square;Try
```



Here, we’ve properly separated `Shape` out into two types with different values for the `kind` property, but `radius` and `sideLength` are declared as required properties in their respective types.

Let’s see what happens here when we try to access the `radius` of a `Shape`.



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Shape'.
  Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Square'.2339Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Shape'.
  Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Square'.}Try
```



Like with our first definition of `Shape`, this is still an error.
When `radius` was optional, we got an error (with `strictNullChecks` enabled) because TypeScript couldn’t tell whether the property was present.
Now that `Shape` is a union, TypeScript is telling us that `shape` might be a `Square`, and `Square`s don’t have `radius` defined on them!
Both interpretations are correct, but only the union encoding of `Shape` will cause an error regardless of how `strictNullChecks` is configured.

But what if we tried checking the `kind` property again?



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  if (shape.kind === "circle") {    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;                      (parameter) shape: Circle  }}Try
```



That got rid of the error!
When every type in a union contains a common property with literal types, TypeScript considers that to be a discriminated union , and can narrow out the members of the union.

In this case, `kind` was that common property (which is what’s considered a discriminant property of `Shape`).
Checking whether the `kind` property was `"circle"` got rid of every type in `Shape` that didn’t have a `kind` property with the type `"circle"`.
That narrowed `shape` down to the type `Circle`.

The same checking works with `switch` statements as well.
Now we can try to write our complete `getArea` without any pesky `!` non-null assertions.



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  switch (shape.kind) {    case "circle":      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;                        (parameter) shape: Circle    case "square":      return shape.sideLength ** 2;              (parameter) shape: Square  }}Try
```



The important thing here was the encoding of `Shape`.
Communicating the right information to TypeScript - that `Circle` and `Square` were really two separate types with specific `kind` fields - was crucial.
Doing that lets us write type-safe TypeScript code that looks no different than the JavaScript we would’ve written otherwise.
From there, the type system was able to do the “right” thing and figure out the types in each branch of our `switch` statement.

 

As an aside, try playing around with the above example and remove some of the return keywords.
You’ll see that type-checking can help avoid bugs when accidentally falling through different clauses in a `switch` statement.

 

Discriminated unions are useful for more than just talking about circles and squares.
They’re good for representing any sort of messaging scheme in JavaScript, like when sending messages over the network (client/server communication), or encoding mutations in a state management framework.

# The `never` type

When narrowing, you can reduce the options of a union to a point where you have removed all possibilities and have nothing left.
In those cases, TypeScript will use a `never` type to represent a state which shouldn’t exist.

# Exhaustiveness checking

The `never` type is assignable to every type; however, no type is assignable to `never` (except `never` itself). This means you can use narrowing and rely on `never` turning up to do exhaustive checking in a `switch` statement.

For example, adding a `default` to our `getArea` function which tries to assign the shape to `never` will not raise an error when every possible case has been handled.



```id
tstype Shape = Circle | Square; function getArea(shape: Shape) {  switch (shape.kind) {    case "circle":      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;    case "square":      return shape.sideLength ** 2;    default:      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;      return _exhaustiveCheck;  }}Try
```



Adding a new member to the `Shape` union, will cause a TypeScript error:



```id
tsinterface Triangle {  kind: "triangle";  sideLength: number;} type Shape = Circle | Square | Triangle; function getArea(shape: Shape) {  switch (shape.kind) {    case "circle":      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;    case "square":      return shape.sideLength ** 2;    default:      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;Type 'Triangle' is not assignable to type 'never'.2322Type 'Triangle' is not assignable to type 'never'.      return _exhaustiveCheck;  }}Try
```

# TypeScript for the New Programmer

 

Congratulations on choosing TypeScript as one of your first languages — you’re already making good decisions!

You’ve probably already heard that TypeScript is a “flavor” or “variant” of JavaScript.
The relationship between TypeScript (TS) and JavaScript (JS) is rather unique among modern programming languages, so learning more about this relationship will help you understand how TypeScript adds to JavaScript.

## What is JavaScript? A Brief History

JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript) started its life as a simple scripting language for browsers.
At the time it was invented, it was expected to be used for short snippets of code embedded in a web page — writing more than a few dozen lines of code would have been somewhat unusual.
Due to this, early web browsers executed such code pretty slowly.
Over time, though, JS became more and more popular, and web developers started using it to create interactive experiences.

Web browser developers responded to this increased JS usage by optimizing their execution engines (dynamic compilation) and extending what could be done with it (adding APIs), which in turn made web developers use it even more.
On modern websites, your browser is frequently running applications that span hundreds of thousands of lines of code.
This is the long and gradual growth of “the web”, starting as a simple network of static pages, and evolving into a platform for rich applications of all kinds.

More than this, JS has become popular enough to be used outside the context of browsers, such as implementing JS servers using node.js.
The “run anywhere” nature of JS makes it an attractive choice for cross-platform development.
There are many developers these days that use only JavaScript to program their entire stack!

To summarize, we have a language that was designed for quick uses, and then grew to a full-fledged tool to write applications with millions of lines.
Every language has its own quirks — oddities and surprises, and JavaScript’s humble beginning makes it have many of these. Some examples:

 

JavaScript’s equality operator (`==`) coerces its operands, leading to unexpected behavior:



```id
jsif ("" == 0) {  // It is! But why??}if (1 < x < 3) {  // True for *any* value of x!}
```



- 

JavaScript also allows accessing properties which aren’t present:



```id
jsconst obj = { width: 10, height: 15 };// Why is this NaN? Spelling is hard!const area = obj.width * obj.heigth;
```



Most programming languages would throw an error when these sorts of errors occur, some would do so during compilation — before any code is running.
When writing small programs, such quirks are annoying but manageable; when writing applications with hundreds or thousands of lines of code, these constant surprises are a serious problem.

## TypeScript: A Static Type Checker

We said earlier that some languages wouldn’t allow those buggy programs to run at all.
Detecting errors in code without running it is referred to as static checking .
Determining what’s an error and what’s not based on the kinds of values being operated on is known as static type checking.

TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values , making it a static type checker .
For example, the last example above has an error because of the type of `obj`.
Here’s the error TypeScript found:



```id
tsconst obj = { width: 10, height: 15 };const area = obj.width * obj.heigth;Property 'heigth' does not exist on type '{ width: number; height: number; }'. Did you mean 'height'?2551Property 'heigth' does not exist on type '{ width: number; height: number; }'. Did you mean 'height'?Try
```



### A Typed Superset of JavaScript

How does TypeScript relate to JavaScript, though?

#### Syntax

TypeScript is a language that is a superset of JavaScript: JS syntax is therefore legal TS.
Syntax refers to the way we write text to form a program.
For example, this code has a syntax error because it’s missing a `)`:



```id
tslet a = (4')' expected.1005')' expected.Try
```



TypeScript doesn’t consider any JavaScript code to be an error because of its syntax.
This means you can take any working JavaScript code and put it in a TypeScript file without worrying about exactly how it is written.

#### Types

However, TypeScript is a typed superset, meaning that it adds rules about how different kinds of values can be used.
The earlier error about `obj.heigth` was not a syntax error: it is an error of using some kind of value (a type ) in an incorrect way.

As another example, this is JavaScript code that you can run in your browser, and it will log a value:



```id
jsconsole.log(4 / []);
```



This syntactically-legal program logs `Infinity`.
TypeScript, though, considers division of number by an array to be a nonsensical operation, and will issue an error:



```id
tsconsole.log(4 / []);The right-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type.2363The right-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type.Try
```



It’s possible you really did intend to divide a number by an array, perhaps just to see what happens, but most of the time, though, this is a programming mistake.
TypeScript’s type checker is designed to allow correct programs through while still catching as many common errors as possible.
(Later, we’ll learn about settings you can use to configure how strictly TypeScript checks your code.)

If you move some code from a JavaScript file to a TypeScript file, you might see type errors depending on how the code is written.
These may be legitimate problems with the code, or TypeScript being overly conservative.
Throughout this guide we’ll demonstrate how to add various TypeScript syntax to eliminate such errors.

#### Runtime Behavior

TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript.
For example, dividing by zero in JavaScript produces `Infinity` instead of throwing a runtime exception.
As a principle, TypeScript never changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.

This means that if you move code from JavaScript to TypeScript, it is guaranteed to run the same way, even if TypeScript thinks that the code has type errors.

Keeping the same runtime behavior as JavaScript is a foundational promise of TypeScript because it means you can easily transition between the two languages without worrying about subtle differences that might make your program stop working.

 

#### Erased Types

Roughly speaking, once TypeScript’s compiler is done with checking your code, it erases the types to produce the resulting “compiled” code.
This means that once your code is compiled, the resulting plain JS code has no type information.

This also means that TypeScript never changes the behavior of your program based on the types it inferred.
The bottom line is that while you might see type errors during compilation, the type system itself has no bearing on how your program works when it runs.

Finally, TypeScript doesn’t provide any additional runtime libraries.
Your programs will use the same standard library (or external libraries) as JavaScript programs, so there’s no additional TypeScript-specific framework to learn.

 

## Learning JavaScript and TypeScript

We frequently see the question “Should I learn JavaScript or TypeScript?“.

The answer is that you can’t learn TypeScript without learning JavaScript!
TypeScript shares syntax and runtime behavior with JavaScript, so anything you learn about JavaScript is helping you learn TypeScript at the same time.

There are many, many resources available for programmers to learn JavaScript; you should not ignore these resources if you’re writing TypeScript.
For example, there are about 20 times more StackOverflow questions tagged `javascript` than `typescript`, but all of the `javascript` questions also apply to TypeScript.

If you find yourself searching for something like “how to sort a list in TypeScript”, remember: TypeScript is JavaScript’s runtime with a compile-time type checker .
The way you sort a list in TypeScript is the same way you do so in JavaScript.
If you find a resource that uses TypeScript directly, that’s great too, but don’t limit yourself to thinking you need TypeScript-specific answers for everyday questions about how to accomplish runtime tasks.

### TypeScript: Documentation - More on Functions

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - More on Functions 

Was this page helpful?

 

# More on Functions

 

Functions are the basic building block of any application, whether they’re local functions, imported from another module, or methods on a class.
They’re also values, and just like other values, TypeScript has many ways to describe how functions can be called.
Let’s learn about how to write types that describe functions.

## Function Type Expressions

The simplest way to describe a function is with a function type expression .
These types are syntactically similar to arrow functions:



```id
tsfunction  void): void' >greeter( void' >fn: (a: string) => void) {   void' >fn("Hello, World");} function printToConsole(s: string) {  console.log(s);}  void): void' >greeter(printToConsole);Try
```



The syntax `(a: string) => void` means “a function with one parameter, named `a`, of type `string`, that doesn’t have a return value”.
Just like with function declarations, if a parameter type isn’t specified, it’s implicitly `any`.

 

Note that the parameter name is required . The function type `(string) => void` means “a function with a parameter named `string` of type `any`“!

 

Of course, we can use a type alias to name a function type:



```id
tstype  void' >GreetFunction = (a: string) => void;function greeter(fn:  void' >GreetFunction) {  // ...}Try
```



## Call Signatures

In JavaScript, functions can have properties in addition to being callable.
However, the function type expression syntax doesn’t allow for declaring properties.
If we want to describe something callable with properties, we can write a call signature in an object type:



```id
tstype DescribableFunction = {  description: string;  (someArg: number): boolean;};function doSomething(fn: DescribableFunction) {  console.log(fn.description + " returned " +  boolean' >fn(6));} function myFunc(someArg: number) {  return someArg > 3;}myFunc.description = "default description"; doSomething(myFunc);Try
```



Note that the syntax is slightly different compared to a function type expression - use `:` between the parameter list and the return type rather than `=>`.

## Construct Signatures

JavaScript functions can also be invoked with the `new` operator.
TypeScript refers to these as constructors because they usually create a new object.
You can write a construct signature by adding the `new` keyword in front of a call signature:



```id
tstype  SomeObject' >SomeConstructor = {  new (s: string): SomeObject;};function fn(ctor:  SomeObject' >SomeConstructor) {  return new  SomeObject' >ctor("hello");}Try
```



Some objects, like JavaScript’s `Date` object, can be called with or without `new`.
You can combine call and construct signatures in the same type arbitrarily:



```id
tsinterface CallOrConstruct {  (n?: number): string;  new (s: string): Date;} function fn(ctor: CallOrConstruct) {  // Passing an argument of type `number` to `ctor` matches it against  // the first definition in the `CallOrConstruct` interface.  console.log( string' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>ctor(10));               (parameter) ctor: CallOrConstruct
(n?: number) => string   // Similarly, passing an argument of type `string` to `ctor` matches it  // against the second definition in the `CallOrConstruct` interface.  console.log(new  Date' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>ctor("10"));                   (parameter) ctor: CallOrConstruct
new (s: string) => Date} fn(Date);Try
```



## Generic Functions

It’s common to write a function where the types of the input relate to the type of the output, or where the types of two inputs are related in some way.
Let’s consider for a moment a function that returns the first element of an array:



```id
tsfunction firstElement(arr: any[]) {  return arr[0];}Try
```



This function does its job, but unfortunately has the return type `any`.
It’d be better if the function returned the type of the array element.

In TypeScript, generics are used when we want to describe a correspondence between two values.
We do this by declaring a type parameter in the function signature:



```id
tsfunction (arr: Type[]): Type | undefined' >firstElement<(arr: Type[]): Type | undefined' >Type>(arr: (arr: Type[]): Type | undefined' >Type[]): (arr: Type[]): Type | undefined' >Type | undefined {  return arr[0];}Try
```



By adding a type parameter `Type` to this function and using it in two places, we’ve created a link between the input of the function (the array) and the output (the return value).
Now when we call it, a more specific type comes out:



```id
ts// s is of type &apos;string&apos;const s = (arr: string[]): string | undefined' >firstElement(["a", "b", "c"]);// n is of type &apos;number&apos;const n = (arr: number[]): number | undefined' >firstElement([1, 2, 3]);// u is of type undefinedconst u = (arr: never[]): undefined' >firstElement([]);Try
```



### Inference

Note that we didn’t have to specify `Type` in this sample.
The type was inferred - chosen automatically - by TypeScript.

We can use multiple type parameters as well.
For example, a standalone version of `map` would look like this:



```id
tsfunction (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >map<(arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Input, (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Output>(arr: (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Input[],  Output' >func: (arg: (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Input) => (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Output): (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Output[] {  return arr..map<Output>(callbackfn: (value: Input, index: number, array: Input[]) => Output, thisArg?: any): Output[]' >map( Output' >func);} // Parameter &apos;n&apos; is of type &apos;string&apos;// &apos;parsed&apos; is of type &apos;number[]&apos;const parsed = (arr: string[], func: (arg: string) => number): number[]' >map(["1", "2", "3"], (n) => parseInt(n));Try
```



Note that in this example, TypeScript could infer both the type of the `Input` type parameter (from the given `string` array), as well as the `Output` type parameter based on the return value of the function expression (`number`).

### Constraints

We’ve written some generic functions that can work on any kind of value.
Sometimes we want to relate two values, but can only operate on a certain subset of values.
In this case, we can use a constraint to limit the kinds of types that a type parameter can accept.

Let’s write a function that returns the longer of two values.
To do this, we need a `length` property that’s a number.
We constrain the type parameter to that type by writing an `extends` clause:



```id
tsfunction (a: Type, b: Type): Type' >longest<(a: Type, b: Type): Type' >Type extends { length: number }>(a: (a: Type, b: Type): Type' >Type, b: (a: Type, b: Type): Type' >Type) {  if (a.length >= b.length) {    return a;  } else {    return b;  }} // longerArray is of type &apos;number[]&apos;const longerArray = (a: number[], b: number[]): number[]' >longest([1, 2], [1, 2, 3]);// longerString is of type &apos;alice&apos; | &apos;bob&apos;const longerString = (a: "alice" | "bob", b: "alice" | "bob"): "alice" | "bob"' >longest("alice", "bob");// Error! Numbers don&apos;t have a &apos;length&apos; propertyconst notOK = (a: {
    length: number;
}, b: {
    length: number;
}): {
    length: number;
}' >longest(10, 100);Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ length: number; }'.2345Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ length: number; }'.Try
```



There are a few interesting things to note in this example.
We allowed TypeScript to infer the return type of `longest`.
Return type inference also works on generic functions.

Because we constrained `Type` to `{ length: number }`, we were allowed to access the `.length` property of the `a` and `b` parameters.
Without the type constraint, we wouldn’t be able to access those properties because the values might have been some other type without a length property.

The types of `longerArray` and `longerString` were inferred based on the arguments.
Remember, generics are all about relating two or more values with the same type!

Finally, just as we’d like, the call to `longest(10, 100)` is rejected because the `number` type doesn’t have a `.length` property.

### Working with Constrained Values

Here’s a common error when working with generic constraints:



```id
tsfunction (obj: Type, minimum: number): Type' >minimumLength<(obj: Type, minimum: number): Type' >Type extends { length: number }>(  obj: (obj: Type, minimum: number): Type' >Type,  minimum: number): (obj: Type, minimum: number): Type' >Type {  if (obj.length >= minimum) {    return obj;  } else {    return { length: minimum };Type '{ length: number; }' is not assignable to type 'Type'.
  '{ length: number; }' is assignable to the constraint of type 'Type', but 'Type' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint '{ length: number; }'.2322Type '{ length: number; }' is not assignable to type 'Type'.
  '{ length: number; }' is assignable to the constraint of type 'Type', but 'Type' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint '{ length: number; }'.  }}Try
```



It might look like this function is OK - `Type` is constrained to `{ length: number }`, and the function either returns `Type` or a value matching that constraint.
The problem is that the function promises to return the same kind of object as was passed in, not just some object matching the constraint.
If this code were legal, you could write code that definitely wouldn’t work:



```id
ts// &apos;arr&apos; gets value { length: 6 }const arr = (obj: number[], minimum: number): number[]' >minimumLength([1, 2, 3], 6);// and crashes here because arrays have// a &apos;slice&apos; method, but not the returned object!console.log(arr..slice(start?: number, end?: number): number[]' >slice(0));Try
```



### Specifying Type Arguments

TypeScript can usually infer the intended type arguments in a generic call, but not always.
For example, let’s say you wrote a function to combine two arrays:



```id
tsfunction (arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >combine<(arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >Type>(arr1: (arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[], arr2: (arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[]): (arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[] {  return arr1..concat(...items: ConcatArray<Type>[]): Type[] (+1 overload)' >concat(arr2);}Try
```



Normally it would be an error to call this function with mismatched arrays:



```id
tsconst arr = (arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): number[]' >combine([1, 2, 3], ["hello"]);Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.Try
```



If you intended to do this, however, you could manually specify `Type`:



```id
tsconst arr = (arr1: (string | number)[], arr2: (string | number)[]): (string | number)[]' >combine<string | number>([1, 2, 3], ["hello"]);Try
```



### Guidelines for Writing Good Generic Functions

Writing generic functions is fun, and it can be easy to get carried away with type parameters.
Having too many type parameters or using constraints where they aren’t needed can make inference less successful, frustrating callers of your function.

#### Push Type Parameters Down

Here are two ways of writing a function that appear similar:



```id
tsfunction (arr: Type[]): Type' >firstElement1<(arr: Type[]): Type' >Type>(arr: (arr: Type[]): Type' >Type[]) {  return arr[0];} function (arr: Type): any' >firstElement2<(arr: Type): any' >Type extends any[]>(arr: (arr: Type): any' >Type) {  return arr[0];} // a: number (good)const a = (arr: number[]): number' >firstElement1([1, 2, 3]);// b: any (bad)const b = (arr: number[]): any' >firstElement2([1, 2, 3]);Try
```



These might seem identical at first glance, but `firstElement1` is a much better way to write this function.
Its inferred return type is `Type`, but `firstElement2`’s inferred return type is `any` because TypeScript has to resolve the `arr[0]` expression using the constraint type, rather than “waiting” to resolve the element during a call.

 

 Rule : When possible, use the type parameter itself rather than constraining it

 

#### Use Fewer Type Parameters

Here’s another pair of similar functions:



```id
tsfunction (arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >filter1<(arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >Type>(arr: (arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >Type[],  boolean' >func: (arg: (arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >Type) => boolean): (arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >Type[] {  return arr..filter(predicate: (value: Type, index: number, array: Type[]) => unknown, thisArg?: any): Type[] (+1 overload)' >filter( boolean' >func);} function  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >filter2< boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Type,  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Func extends (arg:  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Type) => boolean>(  arr:  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Type[],   boolean' >func:  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Func):  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Type[] {  return arr..filter(predicate: (value: Type, index: number, array: Type[]) => unknown, thisArg?: any): Type[] (+1 overload)' >filter( boolean' >func);}Try
```



We’ve created a type parameter `Func` that doesn’t relate two values .
That’s always a red flag, because it means callers wanting to specify type arguments have to manually specify an extra type argument for no reason.
`Func` doesn’t do anything but make the function harder to read and reason about!

 

 Rule : Always use as few type parameters as possible

 

#### Type Parameters Should Appear Twice

Sometimes we forget that a function might not need to be generic:



```id
tsfunction (s: Str): void' >greet<(s: Str): void' >Str extends string>(s: (s: Str): void' >Str) {  console.log("Hello, " + s);} (s: "world"): void' >greet("world");Try
```



We could just as easily have written a simpler version:



```id
tsfunction greet(s: string) {  console.log("Hello, " + s);}Try
```



Remember, type parameters are for relating the types of multiple values .
If a type parameter is only used once in the function signature, it’s not relating anything.
This includes the inferred return type; for example, if `Str` was part of the inferred return type of `greet`, it would be relating the argument and return types, so would be used twice despite appearing only once in the written code.

 

 Rule : If a type parameter only appears in one location, strongly reconsider if you actually need it

 

## Optional Parameters

Functions in JavaScript often take a variable number of arguments.
For example, the `toFixed` method of `number` takes an optional digit count:



```id
tsfunction f(n: number) {  console.log(n.toFixed()); // 0 arguments  console.log(n.toFixed(3)); // 1 argument}Try
```



We can model this in TypeScript by marking the parameter as optional with `?`:



```id
tsfunction f(x?: number) {  // ...}f(); // OKf(10); // OKTry
```



Although the parameter is specified as type `number`, the `x` parameter will actually have the type `number | undefined` because unspecified parameters in JavaScript get the value `undefined`.

You can also provide a parameter default :



```id
tsfunction f(x = 10) {  // ...}Try
```



Now in the body of `f`, `x` will have type `number` because any `undefined` argument will be replaced with `10`.
Note that when a parameter is optional, callers can always pass `undefined`, as this simply simulates a “missing” argument:



```id
ts// All OKf();f(10);f(undefined);Try
```



### Optional Parameters in Callbacks

Once you’ve learned about optional parameters and function type expressions, it’s very easy to make the following mistakes when writing functions that invoke callbacks:



```id
tsfunction  void): void' >myForEach(arr: any[],  void' >callback: (arg: any, index?: number) => void) {  for (let i = 0; i < arr..length: number' >length; i++) {     void' >callback(arr[i], i);  }}Try
```



What people usually intend when writing `index?` as an optional parameter is that they want both of these calls to be legal:



```id
ts void): void' >myForEach([1, 2, 3], (a) => console.log(a)); void): void' >myForEach([1, 2, 3], (a, i) => console.log(a, i));Try
```



What this actually means is that `callback` might get invoked with one argument .
In other words, the function definition says that the implementation might look like this:



```id
tsfunction  void): void' >myForEach(arr: any[],  void' >callback: (arg: any, index?: number) => void) {  for (let i = 0; i < arr..length: number' >length; i++) {    // I don&apos;t feel like providing the index today     void' >callback(arr[i]);  }}Try
```



In turn, TypeScript will enforce this meaning and issue errors that aren’t really possible:

 


```id
ts void): void' >myForEach([1, 2, 3], (a, i) => {  console.log(i.toFixed());'i' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'i' is possibly 'undefined'.});Try
```



In JavaScript, if you call a function with more arguments than there are parameters, the extra arguments are simply ignored.
TypeScript behaves the same way.
Functions with fewer parameters (of the same types) can always take the place of functions with more parameters.

 

 Rule : When writing a function type for a callback, never write an optional parameter unless you intend to call the function without passing that argument

 

## Function Overloads

Some JavaScript functions can be called in a variety of argument counts and types.
For example, you might write a function to produce a `Date` that takes either a timestamp (one argument) or a month/day/year specification (three arguments).

In TypeScript, we can specify a function that can be called in different ways by writing overload signatures .
To do this, write some number of function signatures (usually two or more), followed by the body of the function:



```id
tsfunction makeDate(timestamp: number): Date;function makeDate(m: number, d: number, y: number): Date;function makeDate(mOrTimestamp: number, d?: number, y?: number): Date {  if (d !== undefined && y !== undefined) {    return new  Date (+4 overloads)' >Date(y, mOrTimestamp, d);  } else {    return new  Date (+4 overloads)' >Date(mOrTimestamp);  }}const d1 = makeDate(12345678);const d2 = makeDate(5, 5, 5);const d3 = makeDate(1, 3);No overload expects 2 arguments, but overloads do exist that expect either 1 or 3 arguments.2575No overload expects 2 arguments, but overloads do exist that expect either 1 or 3 arguments.Try
```



In this example, we wrote two overloads: one accepting one argument, and another accepting three arguments.
These first two signatures are called the overload signatures .

Then, we wrote a function implementation with a compatible signature.
Functions have an implementation signature, but this signature can’t be called directly.
Even though we wrote a function with two optional parameters after the required one, it can’t be called with two parameters!

### Overload Signatures and the Implementation Signature

This is a common source of confusion.
Often people will write code like this and not understand why there is an error:



```id
tsfunction fn(x: string): void;function fn() {  // ...}// Expected to be able to call with zero argumentsfn();Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.2554Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.Try
```



Again, the signature used to write the function body can’t be “seen” from the outside.

 

The signature of the implementation is not visible from the outside.
When writing an overloaded function, you should always have two or more signatures above the implementation of the function.

 

The implementation signature must also be compatible with the overload signatures.
For example, these functions have errors because the implementation signature doesn’t match the overloads in a correct way:



```id
tsfunction fn(x: boolean): void;// Argument type isn&apos;t rightfunction fn(x: string): void;This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.2394This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.function fn(x: boolean) {}Try
```




```id
tsfunction fn(x: string): string;// Return type isn&apos;t rightfunction fn(x: number): boolean;This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.2394This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.function fn(x: string | number) {  return "oops";}Try
```



### Writing Good Overloads

Like generics, there are a few guidelines you should follow when using function overloads.
Following these principles will make your function easier to call, easier to understand, and easier to implement.

Let’s consider a function that returns the length of a string or an array:



```id
tsfunction len(s: string): number;function len(arr: any[]): number;function len(x: any) {  return x.length;}Try
```



This function is fine; we can invoke it with strings or arrays.
However, we can’t invoke it with a value that might be a string or an array, because TypeScript can only resolve a function call to a single overload:



```id
tslen(""); // OKlen([0]); // OKlen(Math.random() > 0.5 ? "hello" : [0]);No overload matches this call.
  Overload 1 of 2, '(s: string): number', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'number[] | "hello"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
      Type 'number[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.
  Overload 2 of 2, '(arr: any[]): number', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'number[] | "hello"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'any[]'.
      Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'any[]'.2769No overload matches this call.
  Overload 1 of 2, '(s: string): number', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'number[] | "hello"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
      Type 'number[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.
  Overload 2 of 2, '(arr: any[]): number', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'number[] | "hello"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'any[]'.
      Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'any[]'.Try
```



Because both overloads have the same argument count and same return type, we can instead write a non-overloaded version of the function:



```id
tsfunction len(x: any[] | string) {  return x.length;}Try
```



This is much better!
Callers can invoke this with either sort of value, and as an added bonus, we don’t have to figure out a correct implementation signature.

 

Always prefer parameters with union types instead of overloads when possible

 

## Declaring `this` in a Function

TypeScript will infer what the `this` should be in a function via code flow analysis, for example in the following:



```id
tsconst  void;
}' >user = {  id: 123,   admin: false,   void' >becomeAdmin: function () {    this.admin = true;  },};Try
```



TypeScript understands that the function `user.becomeAdmin` has a corresponding `this` which is the outer object `user`. `this`, heh , can be enough for a lot of cases, but there are a lot of cases where you need more control over what object `this` represents. The JavaScript specification states that you cannot have a parameter called `this`, and so TypeScript uses that syntax space to let you declare the type for `this` in the function body.



```id
tsinterface DB {   boolean): User[]' >filterUsers( boolean' >filter: (this: User) => boolean): User[];} const db =  DB' >getDB();const admins = db. boolean): User[]' >filterUsers(function (this: User) {  return this.admin;});Try
```



This pattern is common with callback-style APIs, where another object typically controls when your function is called. Note that you need to use `function` and not arrow functions to get this behavior:



```id
tsinterface DB {   boolean): User[]' >filterUsers( boolean' >filter: (this: User) => boolean): User[];} const db =  DB' >getDB();const admins = db. boolean): User[]' >filterUsers(() => this.admin);The containing arrow function captures the global value of 'this'.Element implicitly has an 'any' type because type 'typeof globalThis' has no index signature.7041
7017The containing arrow function captures the global value of 'this'.Element implicitly has an 'any' type because type 'typeof globalThis' has no index signature.Try
```



## Other Types to Know About

There are some additional types you’ll want to recognize that appear often when working with function types.
Like all types, you can use them everywhere, but these are especially relevant in the context of functions.

### `void`

`void` represents the return value of functions which don’t return a value.
It’s the inferred type any time a function doesn’t have any `return` statements, or doesn’t return any explicit value from those return statements:



```id
ts// The inferred return type is voidfunction noop() {  return;}Try
```



In JavaScript, a function that doesn’t return any value will implicitly return the value `undefined`.
However, `void` and `undefined` are not the same thing in TypeScript.
There are further details at the end of this chapter.

 

`void` is not the same as `undefined`.

 

### `object`

The special type `object` refers to any value that isn’t a primitive (`string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null`, or `undefined`).
This is different from the empty object type `{ }`, and also different from the global type `Object`.
It’s very likely you will never use `Object`.

 

`object` is not `Object`. Always use `object`!

 

Note that in JavaScript, function values are objects: They have properties, have `Object.prototype` in their prototype chain, are `instanceof Object`, you can call `Object.keys` on them, and so on.
For this reason, function types are considered to be `object`s in TypeScript.

### `unknown`

The `unknown` type represents any value.
This is similar to the `any` type, but is safer because it’s not legal to do anything with an `unknown` value:



```id
tsfunction f1(a: any) {  a.b(); // OK}function f2(a: unknown) {  a.b();'a' is of type 'unknown'.18046'a' is of type 'unknown'.}Try
```



This is useful when describing function types because you can describe functions that accept any value without having `any` values in your function body.

Conversely, you can describe a function that returns a value of unknown type:



```id
tsfunction safeParse(s: string): unknown {  return JSON. any): any' >parse(s);} // Need to be careful with &apos;obj&apos;!const obj = safeParse(someRandomString);Try
```



### `never`

Some functions never return a value:



```id
tsfunction fail(msg: string): never {  throw new  Error' >Error(msg);}Try
```



The `never` type represents values which are never observed.
In a return type, this means that the function throws an exception or terminates execution of the program.

`never` also appears when TypeScript determines there’s nothing left in a union.



```id
tsfunction fn(x: string | number) {  if (typeof x === "string") {    // do something  } else if (typeof x === "number") {    // do something else  } else {    x; // has type &apos;never&apos;!  }}Try
```



### `Function`

The global type `Function` describes properties like `bind`, `call`, `apply`, and others present on all function values in JavaScript.
It also has the special property that values of type `Function` can always be called; these calls return `any`:



```id
tsfunction doSomething(f: Function) {  return f(1, 2, 3);}Try
```



This is an untyped function call and is generally best avoided because of the unsafe `any` return type.

If you need to accept an arbitrary function but don’t intend to call it, the type `() => void` is generally safer.

## Rest Parameters and Arguments

 
 

Background Reading:

 Rest Parameters 

 Spread Syntax 

 


 

### Rest Parameters

In addition to using optional parameters or overloads to make functions that can accept a variety of fixed argument counts, we can also define functions that take an unbounded number of arguments using rest parameters .

A rest parameter appears after all other parameters, and uses the `...` syntax:



```id
tsfunction multiply(n: number, ...m: number[]) {  return m..map<number>(callbackfn: (value: number, index: number, array: number[]) => number, thisArg?: any): number[]' >map((x) => n * x);}// &apos;a&apos; gets value [10, 20, 30, 40]const a = multiply(10, 1, 2, 3, 4);Try
```



In TypeScript, the type annotation on these parameters is implicitly `any[]` instead of `any`, and any type annotation given must be of the form `Array ` or `T[]`, or a tuple type (which we’ll learn about later).

### Rest Arguments

Conversely, we can provide a variable number of arguments from an iterable object (for example, an array) using the spread syntax.
For example, the `push` method of arrays takes any number of arguments:



```id
tsconst arr1 = [1, 2, 3];const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];arr1..push(...items: number[]): number' >push(...arr2);Try
```



Note that in general, TypeScript does not assume that arrays are immutable.
This can lead to some surprising behavior:



```id
ts// Inferred type is number[] -- "an array with zero or more numbers",// not specifically two numbersconst args = [8, 5];const angle = Math.atan2(...args);A spread argument must either have a tuple type or be passed to a rest parameter.2556A spread argument must either have a tuple type or be passed to a rest parameter.Try
```



The best fix for this situation depends a bit on your code, but in general a `const` context is the most straightforward solution:



```id
ts// Inferred as 2-length tupleconst args = [8, 5] as const;// OKconst angle = Math.atan2(...args);Try
```



Using rest arguments may require turning on `downlevelIteration` when targeting older runtimes.

 

## Parameter Destructuring

 
 

Background Reading:

 Destructuring Assignment 

 


 

You can use parameter destructuring to conveniently unpack objects provided as an argument into one or more local variables in the function body.
In JavaScript, it looks like this:



```id
jsfunction sum({ a, b, c }) {  console.log(a + b + c);}sum({ a: 10, b: 3, c: 9 });
```



The type annotation for the object goes after the destructuring syntax:



```id
tsfunction sum({ a, b, c }: { a: number; b: number; c: number }) {  console.log(a + b + c);}Try
```



This can look a bit verbose, but you can use a named type here as well:



```id
ts// Same as prior exampletype ABC = { a: number; b: number; c: number };function sum({ a, b, c }: ABC) {  console.log(a + b + c);}Try
```



## Assignability of Functions

### Return type `void`

The `void` return type for functions can produce some unusual, but expected behavior.

Contextual typing with a return type of `void` does not force functions to not return something. Another way to say this is a contextual function type with a `void` return type (`type voidFunc = () => void`), when implemented, can return any other value, but it will be ignored.

Thus, the following implementations of the type `() => void` are valid:



```id
tstype  void' >voidFunc = () => void; const f1:  void' >voidFunc = () => {  return true;}; const f2:  void' >voidFunc = () => true; const f3:  void' >voidFunc = function () {  return true;};Try
```



And when the return value of one of these functions is assigned to another variable, it will retain the type of `void`:



```id
tsconst v1 =  void' >f1(); const v2 =  void' >f2(); const v3 =  void' >f3();Try
```



This behavior exists so that the following code is valid even though `Array.prototype.push` returns a number and the `Array.prototype.forEach` method expects a function with a return type of `void`.



```id
tsconst src = [1, 2, 3];const dst = [0]; src..forEach(callbackfn: (value: number, index: number, array: number[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((el) => dst..push(...items: number[]): number' >push(el));Try
```



There is one other special case to be aware of, when a literal function definition has a `void` return type, that function must not return anything.



```id
tsfunction f2(): void {  // @ts-expect-error  return true;} const  void' >f3 = function (): void {  // @ts-expect-error  return true;};Try
```

# TypeScript for Java/C# Programmers

 

TypeScript is a popular choice for programmers accustomed to other languages with static typing, such as C# and Java.

TypeScript’s type system offers many of the same benefits, such as better code completion, earlier detection of errors, and clearer communication between parts of your program.
While TypeScript provides many familiar features for these developers, it’s worth stepping back to see how JavaScript (and therefore TypeScript) differ from traditional OOP languages.
Understanding these differences will help you write better JavaScript code, and avoid common pitfalls that programmers who go straight from C#/Java to TypeScript may fall into.

## Co-learning JavaScript

If you’re familiar with JavaScript already but are primarily a Java or C# programmer, this introductory page can help explain some of the common misconceptions and pitfalls you might be susceptible to.
Some of the ways that TypeScript models types are quite different from Java or C#, and it’s important to keep these in mind when learning TypeScript.

If you’re a Java or C# programmer that is new to JavaScript in general, we recommend learning a little bit of JavaScript without types first to understand JavaScript’s runtime behaviors.
Because TypeScript doesn’t change how your code runs , you’ll still have to learn how JavaScript works in order to write code that actually does something!

It’s important to remember that TypeScript uses the same runtime as JavaScript, so any resources about how to accomplish specific runtime behavior (converting a string to a number, displaying an alert, writing a file to disk, etc.) will always apply equally well to TypeScript programs.
Don’t limit yourself to TypeScript-specific resources!

## Rethinking the Class

C# and Java are what we might call mandatory OOP languages.
In these languages, the class is the basic unit of code organization, and also the basic container of all data and behavior at runtime.
Forcing all functionality and data to be held in classes can be a good domain model for some problems, but not every domain needs to be represented this way.

### Free Functions and Data

In JavaScript, functions can live anywhere, and data can be passed around freely without being inside a pre-defined `class` or `struct`.
This flexibility is extremely powerful.
“Free” functions (those not associated with a class) working over data without an implied OOP hierarchy tend to be the preferred model for writing programs in JavaScript.

### Static Classes

Additionally, certain constructs from C# and Java such as singletons and static classes are unnecessary in TypeScript.

## OOP in TypeScript

That said, you can still use classes if you like!
Some problems are well-suited to being solved by a traditional OOP hierarchy, and TypeScript’s support for JavaScript classes will make these models even more powerful.
TypeScript supports many common patterns such as implementing interfaces, inheritance, and static methods.

We’ll cover classes later in this guide.

## Rethinking Types

TypeScript’s understanding of a type is actually quite different from C# or Java’s.
Let’s explore some differences.

### Nominal Reified Type Systems

In C# or Java, any given value or object has one exact type - either `null`, a primitive, or a known class type.
We can call methods like `value.GetType()` or `value.getClass()` to query the exact type at runtime.
The definition of this type will reside in a class somewhere with some name, and we can’t use two classes with similar shapes in lieu of each other unless there’s an explicit inheritance relationship or commonly-implemented interface.

These aspects describe a reified, nominal type system.
The types we wrote in the code are present at runtime, and the types are related via their declarations, not their structures.

### Types as Sets

In C# or Java, it’s meaningful to think of a one-to-one correspondence between runtime types and their compile-time declarations.

In TypeScript, it’s better to think of a type as a set of values that share something in common.
Because types are just sets, a particular value can belong to many sets at the same time.

Once you start thinking of types as sets, certain operations become very natural.
For example, in C#, it’s awkward to pass around a value that is either a `string` or `int`, because there isn’t a single type that represents this sort of value.

In TypeScript, this becomes very natural once you realize that every type is just a set.
How do you describe a value that either belongs in the `string` set or the `number` set?
It simply belongs to the union of those sets: `string | number`.

TypeScript provides a number of mechanisms to work with types in a set-theoretic way, and you’ll find them more intuitive if you think of types as sets.

### Erased Structural Types

In TypeScript, objects are not of a single exact type.
For example, if we construct an object that satisfies an interface, we can use that object where that interface is expected even though there was no declarative relationship between the two.



```id
tsinterface Pointlike {  x: number;  y: number;}interface Named {  name: string;} function logPoint(point: Pointlike) {  console.log("x = " + point.x + ", y = " + point.y);} function logName(x: Named) {  console.log("Hello, " + x.name);} const obj = {  x: 0,  y: 0,  name: "Origin",}; logPoint(obj);logName(obj);Try
```



TypeScript’s type system is structural , not nominal: We can use `obj` as a `Pointlike` because it has `x` and `y` properties that are both numbers.
The relationships between types are determined by the properties they contain, not whether they were declared with some particular relationship.

TypeScript’s type system is also not reified : There’s nothing at runtime that will tell us that `obj` is `Pointlike`.
In fact, the `Pointlike` type is not present in any form at runtime.

Going back to the idea of types as sets , we can think of `obj` as being a member of both the `Pointlike` set of values and the `Named` set of values.

### Consequences of Structural Typing

OOP programmers are often surprised by two particular aspects of structural typing.

#### Empty Types

The first is that the empty type seems to defy expectation:



```id
tsclass Empty {} function fn(arg: Empty) {  // do something?} // No error, but this isn&apos;t an &apos;Empty&apos; ?fn({ k: 10 });Try
```



TypeScript determines if the call to `fn` here is valid by seeing if the provided argument is a valid `Empty`.
It does so by examining the structure of `{ k: 10 }` and `class Empty { }`.
We can see that `{ k: 10 }` has all of the properties that `Empty` does, because `Empty` has no properties.
Therefore, this is a valid call!

This may seem surprising, but it’s ultimately a very similar relationship to one enforced in nominal OOP languages.
A subclass cannot remove a property of its base class, because doing so would destroy the natural subtype relationship between the derived class and its base.
Structural type systems simply identify this relationship implicitly by describing subtypes in terms of having properties of compatible types.

#### Identical Types

Another frequent source of surprise comes with identical types:



```id
tsclass Car {  drive() {    // hit the gas  }}class Golfer {  drive() {    // hit the ball far  }}// No error?let w: Car = new Golfer();
```



Again, this isn’t an error because the structures of these classes are the same.
While this may seem like a potential source of confusion, in practice, identical classes that shouldn’t be related are not common.

We’ll learn more about how classes relate to each other in the Classes chapter.

### Reflection

OOP programmers are accustomed to being able to query the type of any value, even a generic one:



```id
csharp// C#static void LogType<T>() {    Console.WriteLine(typeof(T).Name);}
```



Because TypeScript’s type system is fully erased, information about e.g. the instantiation of a generic type parameter is not available at runtime.

JavaScript does have some limited primitives like `typeof` and `instanceof`, but remember that these operators are still working on the values as they exist in the type-erased output code.
For example, `typeof (new Car())` will be `"object"`, not `Car` or `"Car"`.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Object Types

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - Object Types 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Object Types

 

In JavaScript, the fundamental way that we group and pass around data is through objects.
In TypeScript, we represent those through object types .

As we’ve seen, they can be anonymous:



```id
tsfunction greet(person: { name: string; age: number }) {  return "Hello " + person.name;}Try
```



or they can be named by using either an interface:



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age: number;} function greet(person: Person) {  return "Hello " + person.name;}Try
```



or a type alias:



```id
tstype Person = {  name: string;  age: number;}; function greet(person: Person) {  return "Hello " + person.name;}Try
```



In all three examples above, we’ve written functions that take objects that contain the property `name` (which must be a `string`) and `age` (which must be a `number`).

## Quick Reference

We have cheat-sheets available for both `type` and `interface` , if you want a quick look at the important every-day syntax at a glance.

## Property Modifiers

Each property in an object type can specify a couple of things: the type, whether the property is optional, and whether the property can be written to.

### Optional Properties

Much of the time, we’ll find ourselves dealing with objects that might have a property set.
In those cases, we can mark those properties as optional by adding a question mark (`?`) to the end of their names.



```id
tsinterface PaintOptions {  shape: Shape;  xPos?: number;  yPos?: number;} function paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {  // ...} const shape = getShape();paintShape({ shape });paintShape({ shape, xPos: 100 });paintShape({ shape, yPos: 100 });paintShape({ shape, xPos: 100, yPos: 100 });Try
```



In this example, both `xPos` and `yPos` are considered optional.
We can choose to provide either of them, so every call above to `paintShape` is valid.
All optionality really says is that if the property is set, it better have a specific type.

We can also read from those properties - but when we do under `strictNullChecks` , TypeScript will tell us they’re potentially `undefined`.



```id
tsfunction paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {  let xPos = opts.xPos;                   (property) PaintOptions.xPos?: number | undefined  let yPos = opts.yPos;                   (property) PaintOptions.yPos?: number | undefined  // ...}Try
```



In JavaScript, even if the property has never been set, we can still access it - it’s just going to give us the value `undefined`.
We can just handle `undefined` specially by checking for it.



```id
tsfunction paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {  let xPos = opts.xPos === undefined ? 0 : opts.xPos;       let xPos: number  let yPos = opts.yPos === undefined ? 0 : opts.yPos;       let yPos: number  // ...}Try
```



Note that this pattern of setting defaults for unspecified values is so common that JavaScript has syntax to support it.



```id
tsfunction paintShape({ shape, xPos = 0, yPos = 0 }: PaintOptions) {  console.log("x coordinate at", xPos);                                  (parameter) xPos: number  console.log("y coordinate at", yPos);                                  (parameter) yPos: number  // ...}Try
```



Here we used a destructuring pattern for `paintShape`’s parameter, and provided default values for `xPos` and `yPos`.
Now `xPos` and `yPos` are both definitely present within the body of `paintShape`, but optional for any callers to `paintShape`.

 

Note that there is currently no way to place type annotations within destructuring patterns.
This is because the following syntax already means something different in JavaScript.



```id
tsfunction draw({ shape: Shape, xPos: number = 100 /*...*/ }) {  render(shape);Cannot find name 'shape'. Did you mean 'Shape'?2552Cannot find name 'shape'. Did you mean 'Shape'?  render(xPos);Cannot find name 'xPos'.2304Cannot find name 'xPos'.}Try
```



In an object destructuring pattern, `shape: Shape` means “grab the property `shape` and redefine it locally as a variable named `Shape`.”
Likewise `xPos: number` creates a variable named `number` whose value is based on the parameter’s `xPos`.

 

### `readonly` Properties

Properties can also be marked as `readonly` for TypeScript.
While it won’t change any behavior at runtime, a property marked as `readonly` can’t be written to during type-checking.



```id
tsinterface SomeType {  readonly prop: string;} function doSomething(obj: SomeType) {  // We can read from &apos;obj.prop&apos;.  console.log(`prop has the value &apos;${obj.prop}&apos;.`);   // But we can&apos;t re-assign it.  obj.prop = "hello";Cannot assign to 'prop' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'prop' because it is a read-only property.}Try
```



Using the `readonly` modifier doesn’t necessarily imply that a value is totally immutable - or in other words, that its internal contents can’t be changed.
It just means the property itself can’t be re-written to.



```id
tsinterface Home {  readonly resident: { name: string; age: number };} function visitForBirthday(home: Home) {  // We can read and update properties from &apos;home.resident&apos;.  console.log(`Happy birthday ${home.resident.name}!`);  home.resident.age++;} function evict(home: Home) {  // But we can&apos;t write to the &apos;resident&apos; property itself on a &apos;Home&apos;.  home.resident = {Cannot assign to 'resident' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'resident' because it is a read-only property.    name: "Victor the Evictor",    age: 42,  };}Try
```



It’s important to manage expectations of what `readonly` implies.
It’s useful to signal intent during development time for TypeScript on how an object should be used.
TypeScript doesn’t factor in whether properties on two types are `readonly` when checking whether those types are compatible, so `readonly` properties can also change via aliasing.



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age: number;} interface ReadonlyPerson {  readonly name: string;  readonly age: number;} let writablePerson: Person = {  name: "Person McPersonface",  age: 42,}; // workslet readonlyPerson: ReadonlyPerson = writablePerson; console.log(readonlyPerson.age); // prints &apos;42&apos;writablePerson.age++;console.log(readonlyPerson.age); // prints &apos;43&apos;Try
```



Using mapping modifiers , you can remove `readonly` attributes.

### Index Signatures

Sometimes you don’t know all the names of a type’s properties ahead of time, but you do know the shape of the values.

In those cases you can use an index signature to describe the types of possible values, for example:



```id
tsinterface StringArray {  [index: number]: string;} const myArray: StringArray = getStringArray();const secondItem = myArray[1];          const secondItem: stringTry
```



Above, we have a `StringArray` interface which has an index signature.
This index signature states that when a `StringArray` is indexed with a `number`, it will return a `string`.

Only some types are allowed for index signature properties: `string`, `number`, `symbol`, template string patterns, and union types consisting only of these.

 
 It is possible to support multiple types of indexers... 
 

It is possible to support multiple types of indexers. Note that when using both `number` and `string` indexers, the type returned from a numeric indexer must be a subtype of the type returned from the string indexer. This is because when indexing with a `number`, JavaScript will actually convert that to a `string` before indexing into an object. That means that indexing with `100` (a `number`) is the same thing as indexing with `"100"` (a `string`), so the two need to be consistent.



```id
tsinterface Animal {  name: string;} interface Dog extends Animal {  breed: string;} // Error: indexing with a numeric string might get you a completely separate type of Animal!interface NotOkay {  [x: number]: Animal;'number' index type 'Animal' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'Dog'.2413'number' index type 'Animal' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'Dog'.  [x: string]: Dog;}Try
```


 

While string index signatures are a powerful way to describe the “dictionary” pattern, they also enforce that all properties match their return type.
This is because a string index declares that `obj.property` is also available as `obj["property"]`.
In the following example, `name`’s type does not match the string index’s type, and the type checker gives an error:



```id
tsinterface NumberDictionary {  [index: string]: number;   length: number; // ok  name: string;Property 'name' of type 'string' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'number'.2411Property 'name' of type 'string' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'number'.}Try
```



However, properties of different types are acceptable if the index signature is a union of the property types:



```id
tsinterface NumberOrStringDictionary {  [index: string]: number | string;  length: number; // ok, length is a number  name: string; // ok, name is a string}Try
```



Finally, you can make index signatures `readonly` in order to prevent assignment to their indices:



```id
tsinterface ReadonlyStringArray {  readonly [index: number]: string;} let myArray: ReadonlyStringArray = getReadOnlyStringArray();myArray[2] = "Mallory";Index signature in type 'ReadonlyStringArray' only permits reading.2542Index signature in type 'ReadonlyStringArray' only permits reading.Try
```



You can’t set `myArray[2]` because the index signature is `readonly`.

## Excess Property Checks

Where and how an object is assigned a type can make a difference in the type system.
One of the key examples of this is in excess property checking, which validates the object more thoroughly when it is created and assigned to an object type during creation.



```id
tsinterface SquareConfig {  color?: string;  width?: number;} function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {  return {    color: config.color || "red",    area: config.width ? config.width * config.width : 20,  };} let mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 });Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?2561Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?Try
```



Notice the given argument to `createSquare` is spelled `colour` instead of `color`.
In plain JavaScript, this sort of thing fails silently.

You could argue that this program is correctly typed, since the `width` properties are compatible, there’s no `color` property present, and the extra `colour` property is insignificant.

However, TypeScript takes the stance that there’s probably a bug in this code.
Object literals get special treatment and undergo excess property checking when assigning them to other variables, or passing them as arguments.
If an object literal has any properties that the “target type” doesn’t have, you’ll get an error:



```id
tslet mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 });Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?2561Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?Try
```



Getting around these checks is actually really simple.
The easiest method is to just use a type assertion:



```id
tslet mySquare = createSquare({ width: 100, opacity: 0.5 } as SquareConfig);Try
```



However, a better approach might be to add a string index signature if you’re sure that the object can have some extra properties that are used in some special way.
If `SquareConfig` can have `color` and `width` properties with the above types, but could also have any number of other properties, then we could define it like so:



```id
tsinterface SquareConfig {  color?: string;  width?: number;  [propName: string]: unknown;}Try
```



Here we’re saying that `SquareConfig` can have any number of properties, and as long as they aren’t `color` or `width`, their types don’t matter.

One final way to get around these checks, which might be a bit surprising, is to assign the object to another variable:
Since assigning `squareOptions` won’t undergo excess property checks, the compiler won’t give you an error:



```id
tslet squareOptions = { colour: "red", width: 100 };let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);Try
```



The above workaround will work as long as you have a common property between `squareOptions` and `SquareConfig`.
In this example, it was the property `width`. It will however, fail if the variable does not have any common object property. For example:



```id
tslet squareOptions = { colour: "red" };let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);Type '{ colour: string; }' has no properties in common with type 'SquareConfig'.2559Type '{ colour: string; }' has no properties in common with type 'SquareConfig'.Try
```



Keep in mind that for simple code like above, you probably shouldn’t be trying to “get around” these checks.
For more complex object literals that have methods and hold state, you might need to keep these techniques in mind, but a majority of excess property errors are actually bugs.

That means if you’re running into excess property checking problems for something like option bags, you might need to revise some of your type declarations.
In this instance, if it’s okay to pass an object with both a `color` or `colour` property to `createSquare`, you should fix up the definition of `SquareConfig` to reflect that.

## Extending Types

It’s pretty common to have types that might be more specific versions of other types.
For example, we might have a `BasicAddress` type that describes the fields necessary for sending letters and packages in the U.S.



```id
tsinterface BasicAddress {  name?: string;  street: string;  city: string;  country: string;  postalCode: string;}Try
```



In some situations that’s enough, but addresses often have a unit number associated with them if the building at an address has multiple units.
We can then describe an `AddressWithUnit`.

 


```id
tsinterface AddressWithUnit {  name?: string;  unit: string;  street: string;  city: string;  country: string;  postalCode: string;}Try
```



This does the job, but the downside here is that we had to repeat all the other fields from `BasicAddress` when our changes were purely additive.
Instead, we can extend the original `BasicAddress` type and just add the new fields that are unique to `AddressWithUnit`.



```id
tsinterface BasicAddress {  name?: string;  street: string;  city: string;  country: string;  postalCode: string;} interface AddressWithUnit extends BasicAddress {  unit: string;}Try
```



The `extends` keyword on an `interface` allows us to effectively copy members from other named types, and add whatever new members we want.
This can be useful for cutting down the amount of type declaration boilerplate we have to write, and for signaling intent that several different declarations of the same property might be related.
For example, `AddressWithUnit` didn’t need to repeat the `street` property, and because `street` originates from `BasicAddress`, a reader will know that those two types are related in some way.

`interface`s can also extend from multiple types.



```id
tsinterface Colorful {  color: string;} interface Circle {  radius: number;} interface ColorfulCircle extends Colorful, Circle {} const cc: ColorfulCircle = {  color: "red",  radius: 42,};Try
```



## Intersection Types

`interface`s allowed us to build up new types from other types by extending them.
TypeScript provides another construct called intersection types that is mainly used to combine existing object types.

An intersection type is defined using the `&` operator.



```id
tsinterface Colorful {  color: string;}interface Circle {  radius: number;} type ColorfulCircle = Colorful & Circle;Try
```



Here, we’ve intersected `Colorful` and `Circle` to produce a new type that has all the members of `Colorful` and `Circle`.



```id
tsfunction draw(circle: Colorful & Circle) {  console.log(`Color was ${circle.color}`);  console.log(`Radius was ${circle.radius}`);} // okaydraw({ color: "blue", radius: 42 }); // oopsdraw({ color: "red", raidus: 42 });Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'raidus' does not exist in type 'Colorful & Circle'. Did you mean to write 'radius'?2561Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'raidus' does not exist in type 'Colorful & Circle'. Did you mean to write 'radius'?Try
```



## Interface Extension vs. Intersection

We just looked at two ways to combine types which are similar, but are actually subtly different.
With interfaces, we could use an `extends` clause to extend from other types, and we were able to do something similar with intersections and name the result with a type alias.
The principal difference between the two is how conflicts are handled, and that difference is typically one of the main reasons why you’d pick one over the other between an interface and a type alias of an intersection type.

If interfaces are defined with the same name, TypeScript will attempt to merge them if the properties are compatible. If the properties are not compatible (i.e., they have the same property name but different types), TypeScript will raise an error.

In the case of intersection types, properties with different types will be merged automatically. When the type is used later, TypeScript will expect the property to satisfy both types simultaneously, which may produce unexpected results.

For example, the following code will throw an error because the properties are incompatible:



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;}interface Person {  name: number;}
```



In contrast, the following code will compile, but it results in a `never` type:



```id
tsinterface Person1 {  name: string;} interface Person2 {  name: number;} type Staff = Person1 & Person2 declare const staffer: Staff;staffer.name;         (property) name: neverTry
```



In this case, Staff would require the name property to be both a string and a number, which results in property being of type `never`.

## Generic Object Types

Let’s imagine a `Box` type that can contain any value - `string`s, `number`s, `Giraffe`s, whatever.



```id
tsinterface Box {  contents: any;}Try
```



Right now, the `contents` property is typed as `any`, which works, but can lead to accidents down the line.

We could instead use `unknown`, but that would mean that in cases where we already know the type of `contents`, we’d need to do precautionary checks, or use error-prone type assertions.



```id
tsinterface Box {  contents: unknown;} let x: Box = {  contents: "hello world",}; // we could check &apos;x.contents&apos;if (typeof x.contents === "string") {  console.log(x.contents.toLowerCase());} // or we could use a type assertionconsole.log((x.contents as string).toLowerCase());Try
```



One type safe approach would be to instead scaffold out different `Box` types for every type of `contents`.



```id
tsinterface NumberBox {  contents: number;} interface StringBox {  contents: string;} interface BooleanBox {  contents: boolean;}Try
```



But that means we’ll have to create different functions, or overloads of functions, to operate on these types.



```id
tsfunction setContents(box: StringBox, newContents: string): void;function setContents(box: NumberBox, newContents: number): void;function setContents(box: BooleanBox, newContents: boolean): void;function setContents(box: { contents: any }, newContents: any) {  box.contents = newContents;}Try
```



That’s a lot of boilerplate. Moreover, we might later need to introduce new types and overloads.
This is frustrating, since our box types and overloads are all effectively the same.

Instead, we can make a generic `Box` type which declares a type parameter .



```id
tsinterface ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;}Try
```



You might read this as “A `Box` of `Type` is something whose `contents` have type `Type`”.
Later on, when we refer to `Box`, we have to give a type argument in place of `Type`.



```id
tslet ' >box: ' >Box<string>;Try
```



Think of `Box` as a template for a real type, where `Type` is a placeholder that will get replaced with some other type.
When TypeScript sees `Box `, it will replace every instance of `Type` in `Box ` with `string`, and end up working with something like `{ contents: string }`.
In other words, `Box ` and our earlier `StringBox` work identically.



```id
tsinterface ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;}interface StringBox {  contents: string;} let ' >boxA: ' >Box<string> = { .contents: string' >contents: "hello" };' >boxA..contents: string' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>contents;        (property) Box<string>.contents: string let boxB: StringBox = { contents: "world" };boxB.contents;        (property) StringBox.contents: stringTry
```



`Box` is reusable in that `Type` can be substituted with anything. That means that when we need a box for a new type, we don’t need to declare a new `Box` type at all (though we certainly could if we wanted to).



```id
tsinterface ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;} interface Apple {  // ....} // Same as &apos;{ contents: Apple }&apos;.type ' >AppleBox = ' >Box<Apple>;Try
```



This also means that we can avoid overloads entirely by instead using generic functions .



```id
tsfunction (box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type): void' >setContents<(box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type): void' >Type>(' >box: ' >Box<(box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type): void' >Type>, newContents: (box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type): void' >Type) {  ' >box..contents: Type' >contents = newContents;}Try
```



It is worth noting that type aliases can also be generic. We could have defined our new `Box ` interface, which was:



```id
tsinterface ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;}Try
```



by using a type alias instead:



```id
tstype  = {
    contents: Type;
}' >Box<' >Type> = {  contents: ' >Type;};Try
```



Since type aliases, unlike interfaces, can describe more than just object types, we can also use them to write other kinds of generic helper types.



```id
tstype  = Type | null' >OrNull<' >Type> = ' >Type | null; type  = Type | Type[]' >OneOrMany<' >Type> = ' >Type | ' >Type[]; type  = OneOrMany<Type> | null' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>OneOrManyOrNull<' >Type> =  = Type | null' >OrNull< = Type | Type[]' >OneOrMany<' >Type>>;           type OneOrManyOrNull<Type> = OneOrMany<Type> | null type  | null' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>OneOrManyOrNullStrings =  = OneOrMany<Type> | null' >OneOrManyOrNull<string>;               type OneOrManyOrNullStrings = OneOrMany<string> | nullTry
```



We’ll circle back to type aliases in just a little bit.

### The `Array` Type

Generic object types are often some sort of container type that work independently of the type of elements they contain.
It’s ideal for data structures to work this way so that they’re re-usable across different data types.

It turns out we’ve been working with a type just like that throughout this handbook: the `Array` type.
Whenever we write out types like `number[]` or `string[]`, that’s really just a shorthand for `Array ` and `Array `.



```id
tsfunction ): void' >doSomething(value: ' >Array<string>) {  // ...} let myArray: string[] = ["hello", "world"]; // either of these work!): void' >doSomething(myArray);): void' >doSomething(new (...items: string[]) => string[] (+2 overloads)' >Array("hello", "world"));Try
```



Much like the `Box` type above, `Array` itself is a generic type.



```id
tsinterface ' >Array<' >Type> {  /**   * Gets or sets the length of the array.   */  .length: number' >length: number;   /**   * Removes the last element from an array and returns it.   */  .pop(): Type | undefined' >pop(): ' >Type | undefined;   /**   * Appends new elements to an array, and returns the new length of the array.   */  .push(...items: Type[]): number' >push(...items: ' >Type[]): number;   // ...}Try
```



Modern JavaScript also provides other data structures which are generic, like `Map `, `Set `, and `Promise `.
All this really means is that because of how `Map`, `Set`, and `Promise` behave, they can work with any sets of types.

### The `ReadonlyArray` Type

The `ReadonlyArray` is a special type that describes arrays that shouldn’t be changed.



```id
tsfunction ): void' >doStuff(values: ' >ReadonlyArray<string>) {  // We can read from &apos;values&apos;...  const copy = values..slice(start?: number, end?: number): string[]' >slice();  console.log(`The first value is ${values[0]}`);   // ...but we can&apos;t mutate &apos;values&apos;.  values.push("hello!");Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.2339Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.}Try
```



Much like the `readonly` modifier for properties, it’s mainly a tool we can use for intent.
When we see a function that returns `ReadonlyArray`s, it tells us we’re not meant to change the contents at all, and when we see a function that consumes `ReadonlyArray`s, it tells us that we can pass any array into that function without worrying that it will change its contents.

Unlike `Array`, there isn’t a `ReadonlyArray` constructor that we can use.



```id
tsnew ReadonlyArray("red", "green", "blue");'ReadonlyArray' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.2693'ReadonlyArray' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.Try
```



Instead, we can assign regular `Array`s to `ReadonlyArray`s.



```id
tsconst roArray: ' >ReadonlyArray<string> = ["red", "green", "blue"];Try
```



Just as TypeScript provides a shorthand syntax for `Array ` with `Type[]`, it also provides a shorthand syntax for `ReadonlyArray ` with `readonly Type[]`.



```id
tsfunction doStuff(values: readonly string[]) {  // We can read from &apos;values&apos;...  const copy = values..slice(start?: number, end?: number): string[]' >slice();  console.log(`The first value is ${values[0]}`);   // ...but we can&apos;t mutate &apos;values&apos;.  values.push("hello!");Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.2339Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.}Try
```



One last thing to note is that unlike the `readonly` property modifier, assignability isn’t bidirectional between regular `Array`s and `ReadonlyArray`s.



```id
tslet x: readonly string[] = [];let y: string[] = []; x = y;y = x;The type 'readonly string[]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type 'string[]'.4104The type 'readonly string[]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type 'string[]'.Try
```



### Tuple Types

A tuple type is another sort of `Array` type that knows exactly how many elements it contains, and exactly which types it contains at specific positions.



```id
tstype StringNumberPair = [string, number];Try
```



Here, `StringNumberPair` is a tuple type of `string` and `number`.
Like `ReadonlyArray`, it has no representation at runtime, but is significant to TypeScript.
To the type system, `StringNumberPair` describes arrays whose `0` index contains a `string` and whose `1` index contains a `number`.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(pair: [string, number]) {  const a = pair[0];       const a: string  const b = pair[1];       const b: number  // ...} doSomething(["hello", 42]);Try
```



If we try to index past the number of elements, we’ll get an error.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(pair: [string, number]) {  // ...   const c = pair[2];Tuple type '[string, number]' of length '2' has no element at index '2'.2493Tuple type '[string, number]' of length '2' has no element at index '2'.}Try
```



We can also destructure tuples using JavaScript’s array destructuring.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(stringHash: [string, number]) {  const [inputString, hash] = stringHash;   console.log(inputString);                  const inputString: string   console.log(hash);               const hash: number}Try
```


 

Tuple types are useful in heavily convention-based APIs, where each element’s meaning is “obvious”.
This gives us flexibility in whatever we want to name our variables when we destructure them.
In the above example, we were able to name elements `0` and `1` to whatever we wanted.

However, since not every user holds the same view of what’s obvious, it may be worth reconsidering whether using objects with descriptive property names may be better for your API.

 

Other than those length checks, simple tuple types like these are equivalent to types which are versions of `Array`s that declare properties for specific indexes, and that declare `length` with a numeric literal type.



```id
tsinterface StringNumberPair {  // specialized properties  length: 2;  0: string;  1: number;   // Other &apos;Array<string | number>&apos; members...  ' >slice(start?: number, end?: number): ' >Array<string | number>;}Try
```



Another thing you may be interested in is that tuples can have optional properties by writing out a question mark (`?` after an element’s type).
Optional tuple elements can only come at the end, and also affect the type of `length`.



```id
tstype Either2dOr3d = [number, number, number?]; function setCoordinate(coord: Either2dOr3d) {  const [x, y, z] = coord;              const z: number | undefined   console.log(`Provided coordinates had ${coord.length} dimensions`);                                                  (property) length: 2 | 3}Try
```



Tuples can also have rest elements, which have to be an array/tuple type.



```id
tstype StringNumberBooleans = [string, number, ...boolean[]];type StringBooleansNumber = [string, ...boolean[], number];type BooleansStringNumber = [...boolean[], string, number];Try
```



 `StringNumberBooleans` describes a tuple whose first two elements are `string` and `number` respectively, but which may have any number of `boolean`s following.

- `StringBooleansNumber` describes a tuple whose first element is `string` and then any number of `boolean`s and ending with a `number`.

- `BooleansStringNumber` describes a tuple whose starting elements are any number of `boolean`s and ending with a `string` then a `number`.

A tuple with a rest element has no set “length” - it only has a set of well-known elements in different positions.



```id
tsconst a: StringNumberBooleans = ["hello", 1];const b: StringNumberBooleans = ["beautiful", 2, true];const c: StringNumberBooleans = ["world", 3, true, false, true, false, true];Try
```



Why might optional and rest elements be useful?
Well, it allows TypeScript to correspond tuples with parameter lists.
Tuples types can be used in rest parameters and arguments , so that the following:



```id
tsfunction readButtonInput(...args: [string, number, ...boolean[]]) {  const [name, version, ...input] = args;  // ...}Try
```



is basically equivalent to:



```id
tsfunction readButtonInput(name: string, version: number, ...input: boolean[]) {  // ...}Try
```



This is handy when you want to take a variable number of arguments with a rest parameter, and you need a minimum number of elements, but you don’t want to introduce intermediate variables.

 

### `readonly` Tuple Types

One final note about tuple types - tuple types have `readonly` variants, and can be specified by sticking a `readonly` modifier in front of them - just like with array shorthand syntax.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {  // ...}Try
```



As you might expect, writing to any property of a `readonly` tuple isn’t allowed in TypeScript.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {  pair[0] = "hello!";Cannot assign to '0' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to '0' because it is a read-only property.}Try
```



Tuples tend to be created and left un-modified in most code, so annotating types as `readonly` tuples when possible is a good default.
This is also important given that array literals with `const` assertions will be inferred with `readonly` tuple types.



```id
tslet point = [3, 4] as const; function distanceFromOrigin([x, y]: [number, number]) {  return Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2);} distanceFromOrigin(point);Argument of type 'readonly [3, 4]' is not assignable to parameter of type '[number, number]'.
  The type 'readonly [3, 4]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type '[number, number]'.2345Argument of type 'readonly [3, 4]' is not assignable to parameter of type '[number, number]'.
  The type 'readonly [3, 4]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type '[number, number]'.Try
```



Here, `distanceFromOrigin` never modifies its elements, but expects a mutable tuple.
Since `point`’s type was inferred as `readonly [3, 4]`, it won’t be compatible with `[number, number]` since that type can’t guarantee `point`’s elements won’t be mutated.

# TypeScript for Functional Programmers

 

TypeScript began its life as an attempt to bring traditional object-oriented types
to JavaScript so that the programmers at Microsoft could bring
traditional object-oriented programs to the web. As it has developed, TypeScript’s type
system has evolved to model code written by native JavaScripters. The
resulting system is powerful, interesting and messy.

This introduction is designed for working Haskell or ML programmers
who want to learn TypeScript. It describes how the type system of
TypeScript differs from Haskell’s type system. It also describes
unique features of TypeScript’s type system that arise from its
modelling of JavaScript code.

This introduction does not cover object-oriented programming. In
practice, object-oriented programs in TypeScript are similar to those
in other popular languages with OO features.

## Prerequisites

In this introduction, I assume you know the following:

 How to program in JavaScript, the good parts.

- Type syntax of a C-descended language.

If you need to learn the good parts of JavaScript, read
 JavaScript: The Good Parts .
You may be able to skip the book if you know how to write programs in
a call-by-value lexically scoped language with lots of mutability and
not much else.
 R 4 RS Scheme is a good example.

 The C++ Programming Language is
a good place to learn about C-style type syntax. Unlike C++,
TypeScript uses postfix types, like so: `x: string` instead of `string x`.

## Concepts not in Haskell

### Built-in types

JavaScript defines 8 built-in types:

 
 
 
 Type 
 Explanation 
 
 
 
 
 `Number` 
 a double-precision IEEE 754 floating point. 
 
 
 `String` 
 an immutable UTF-16 string. 
 
 
 `BigInt` 
 integers in the arbitrary precision format. 
 
 
 `Boolean` 
 `true` and `false`. 
 
 
 `Symbol` 
 a unique value usually used as a key. 
 
 
 `Null` 
 equivalent to the unit type. 
 
 
 `Undefined` 
 also equivalent to the unit type. 
 
 
 `Object` 
 similar to records. 
 
 
 

 See the MDN page for more detail .

TypeScript has corresponding primitive types for the built-in types:

- `number`

- `string`

- `bigint`

- `boolean`

- `symbol`

- `null`

- `undefined`

- `object`

#### Other important TypeScript types

 
 
 
 Type 
 Explanation 
 
 
 
 
 `unknown` 
 the top type. 
 
 
 `never` 
 the bottom type. 
 
 
 object literal 
 e.g. `{ property: Type }` 
 
 
 `void` 
 for functions with no documented return value 
 
 
 `T[]` 
 mutable arrays, also written `Array ` 
 
 
 `[T, T]` 
 tuples, which are fixed-length but mutable 
 
 
 `(t: T) => U` 
 functions 
 
 
 

Notes:

- 

Function syntax includes parameter names. This is pretty hard to get used to!



```id
tslet fst: (a: any, b: any) => any = (a, b) => a;// or more precisely:let fst: <T, U>(a: T, b: U) => T = (a, b) => a;
```



- 

Object literal type syntax closely mirrors object literal value syntax:



```id
tslet o: { n: number; xs: object[] } = { n: 1, xs: [] };
```



- 

`[T, T]` is a subtype of `T[]`. This is different than Haskell, where tuples are not related to lists.

#### Boxed types

JavaScript has boxed equivalents of primitive types that contain the
methods that programmers associate with those types. TypeScript
reflects this with, for example, the difference between the primitive
type `number` and the boxed type `Number`. The boxed types are rarely
needed, since their methods return primitives.



```id
ts(1).toExponential();// equivalent toNumber.prototype.toExponential.call(1);
```



Note that calling a method on a numeric literal requires it to be in
parentheses to aid the parser.

### Gradual typing

TypeScript uses the type `any` whenever it can’t tell what the type of
an expression should be. Compared to `Dynamic`, calling `any` a type
is an overstatement. It just turns off the type checker
wherever it appears. For example, you can push any value into an
`any[]` without marking the value in any way:



```id
ts// with "noImplicitAny": false in tsconfig.json, anys: any[]const anys = [];anys..push(...items: any[]): number' >push(1);anys..push(...items: any[]): number' >push("oh no");anys..push(...items: any[]): number' >push({ anything: "goes" });Try
```



And you can use an expression of type `any` anywhere:



```id
tsanys.map(anys[1]); // oh no, "oh no" is not a function
```



`any` is contagious, too — if you initialize a variable with an
expression of type `any`, the variable has type `any` too.



```id
tslet sepsis = anys[0] + anys[1]; // this could mean anything
```



To get an error when TypeScript produces an `any`, use
`"noImplicitAny": true`, or `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`.

### Structural typing

Structural typing is a familiar concept to most functional
programmers, although Haskell and most MLs are not
structurally typed. Its basic form is pretty simple:



```id
ts// @strict: falselet o = { x: "hi", extra: 1 }; // oklet o2: { x: string } = o; // ok
```



Here, the object literal `{ x: "hi", extra: 1 }` has a matching
literal type `{ x: string, extra: number }`. That
type is assignable to `{ x: string }` since
it has all the required properties and those properties have
assignable types. The extra property doesn’t prevent assignment, it
just makes it a subtype of `{ x: string }`.

Named types just give a name to a type; for assignability purposes
there’s no difference between the type alias `One` and the interface
type `Two` below. They both have a property `p: string`. (Type aliases
behave differently from interfaces with respect to recursive
definitions and type parameters, however.)



```id
tstype One = { p: string };interface Two {  p: string;}class Three {  p = "Hello";} let x: One = { p: "hi" };let two: Two = x;two = new Three();Try
```



### Unions

In TypeScript, union types are untagged. In other words, they are not
discriminated unions like `data` in Haskell. However, you can often
discriminate types in a union using built-in tags or other properties.



```id
tsfunction  string) | {
    s: string;
}): string' >start(   string)' >arg: string | string[] | (() => string) | { s: string }): string {  // this is super common in JavaScript  if (typeof  string)' >arg === "string") {    return commonCase(arg);  } else if (Array.isArray( string)' >arg)) {    return arg..map<string>(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => string, thisArg?: any): string[]' >map(commonCase)..join(separator?: string): string' >join(",");  } else if (typeof  string)' >arg === "function") {    return commonCase( string' >arg());  } else {    return commonCase(arg.s);  }   function commonCase(s: string): string {    // finally, just convert a string to another string    return s;  }}Try
```



`string`, `Array` and `Function` have built-in type predicates,
conveniently leaving the object type for the `else` branch. It is
possible, however, to generate unions that are difficult to
differentiate at runtime. For new code, it’s best to build only
discriminated unions.

The following types have built-in predicates:

 
 
 
 Type 
 Predicate 
 
 
 
 
 string 
 `typeof s === "string"` 
 
 
 number 
 `typeof n === "number"` 
 
 
 bigint 
 `typeof m === "bigint"` 
 
 
 boolean 
 `typeof b === "boolean"` 
 
 
 symbol 
 `typeof g === "symbol"` 
 
 
 undefined 
 `typeof undefined === "undefined"` 
 
 
 function 
 `typeof f === "function"` 
 
 
 array 
 `Array.isArray(a)` 
 
 
 object 
 `typeof o === "object"` 
 
 
 

Note that functions and arrays are objects at runtime, but have their
own predicates.

#### Intersections

In addition to unions, TypeScript also has intersections:



```id
tstype Combined = { a: number } & { b: string };type Conflicting = { a: number } & { a: string };Try
```



`Combined` has two properties, `a` and `b`, just as if they had been
written as one object literal type. Intersection and union are
recursive in case of conflicts, so `Conflicting.a: number & string`.

### Unit types

Unit types are subtypes of primitive types that contain exactly one
primitive value. For example, the string `"foo"` has the type
`"foo"`. Since JavaScript has no built-in enums, it is common to use a set of
well-known strings instead. Unions of string literal types allow
TypeScript to type this pattern:



```id
tsdeclare function pad(s: string, n: number, direction: "left" | "right"): string;pad("hi", 10, "left");Try
```



When needed, the compiler widens — converts to a
supertype — the unit type to the primitive type, such as `"foo"`
to `string`. This happens when using mutability, which can hamper some
uses of mutable variables:



```id
tslet s = "right";pad("hi", 10, s); // error: &apos;string&apos; is not assignable to &apos;"left" | "right"&apos;Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right"'.2345Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right"'.Try
```



Here’s how the error happens:

- `"right": "right"`

- `s: string` because `"right"` widens to `string` on assignment to a mutable variable.

- `string` is not assignable to `"left" | "right"`

You can work around this with a type annotation for `s`, but that
in turn prevents assignments to `s` of variables that are not of type
`"left" | "right"`.



```id
tslet s: "left" | "right" = "right";pad("hi", 10, s);Try
```



## Concepts similar to Haskell

### Contextual typing

TypeScript has some obvious places where it can infer types, like
variable declarations:



```id
tslet s = "I&apos;m a string!";Try
```



But it also infers types in a few other places that you may not expect
if you’ve worked with other C-syntax languages:



```id
tsdeclare function (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >map<(f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >T, (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >U>( U' >f: (t: (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >T) => (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >U, ts: (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >T[]): (f: (t: T) => U, ts: T[]): U[]' >U[];let sns = (f: (t: number) => string, ts: number[]): string[]' >map((n) => n.toString(), [1, 2, 3]);Try
```



Here, `n: number` in this example also, despite the fact that `T` and `U`
have not been inferred before the call. In fact, after `[1,2,3]` has
been used to infer `T=number`, the return type of `n => n.toString()`
is used to infer `U=string`, causing `sns` to have the type
`string[]`.

Note that inference will work in any order, but intellisense will only
work left-to-right, so TypeScript prefers to declare `map` with the
array first:



```id
tsdeclare function (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >map<(ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >T, (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >U>(ts: (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >T[],  U' >f: (t: (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >T) => (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >U): (ts: T[], f: (t: T) => U): U[]' >U[];Try
```



Contextual typing also works recursively through object literals, and
on unit types that would otherwise be inferred as `string` or
`number`. And it can infer return types from context:



```id
tsdeclare function (thunk: (t: T) => void): T' >run<(thunk: (t: T) => void): T' >T>( void' >thunk: (t: (thunk: (t: T) => void): T' >T) => void): (thunk: (t: T) => void): T' >T;let i: { inference: string } = (thunk: (t: {
    inference: string;
}) => void): {
    inference: string;
}' >run((o) => {  o.inference = "INSERT STATE HERE";});Try
```



The type of `o` is determined to be `{ inference: string }` because

- Declaration initializers are contextually typed by the
declaration’s type: `{ inference: string }`.

- The return type of a call uses the contextual type for inferences,
so the compiler infers that `T={ inference: string }`.

- Arrow functions use the contextual type to type their parameters,
so the compiler gives `o: { inference: string }`.

And it does so while you are typing, so that after typing `o.`, you
get completions for the property `inference`, along with any other
properties you’d have in a real program.
Altogether, this feature can make TypeScript’s inference look a bit
like a unifying type inference engine, but it is not.

### Type aliases

Type aliases are mere aliases, just like `type` in Haskell. The
compiler will attempt to use the alias name wherever it was used in
the source code, but does not always succeed.



```id
tstype Size = [number, number];let x: Size = [101.1, 999.9];Try
```



The closest equivalent to `newtype` is a tagged intersection :



```id
tstype FString = string & { __compileTimeOnly: any };
```



An `FString` is just like a normal string, except that the compiler
thinks it has a property named `__compileTimeOnly` that doesn’t
actually exist. This means that `FString` can still be assigned to
`string`, but not the other way round.

### Discriminated Unions

The closest equivalent to `data` is a union of types with discriminant
properties, normally called discriminated unions in TypeScript:



```id
tstype Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; x: number }  | { kind: "triangle"; x: number; y: number };
```



Unlike Haskell, the tag, or discriminant, is just a property in each
object type. Each variant has an identical property with a different
unit type. This is still a normal union type; the leading `|` is
an optional part of the union type syntax. You can discriminate the
members of the union using normal JavaScript code:



```id
tstype Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; x: number }  | { kind: "triangle"; x: number; y: number }; function area(s: Shape) {  if (s.kind === "circle") {    return Math.PI * s.radius * s.radius;  } else if (s.kind === "square") {    return s.x * s.x;  } else {    return (s.x * s.y) / 2;  }}Try
```



Note that the return type of `area` is inferred to be `number` because
TypeScript knows the function is total. If some variant is not
covered, the return type of `area` will be `number | undefined` instead.

Also, unlike Haskell, common properties show up in any union, so you
can usefully discriminate multiple members of the union:



```id
tsfunction height(s: Shape) {  if (s.kind === "circle") {    return 2 * s.radius;  } else {    // s.kind: "square" | "triangle"    return s.x;  }}Try
```



### Type Parameters

Like most C-descended languages, TypeScript requires declaration of
type parameters:



```id
tsfunction liftArray<T>(t: T): Array<T> {  return [t];}
```



There is no case requirement, but type parameters are conventionally
single uppercase letters. Type parameters can also be constrained to a
type, which behaves a bit like type class constraints:



```id
tsfunction firstish<T extends { length: number }>(t1: T, t2: T): T {  return t1.length > t2.length ? t1 : t2;}
```



TypeScript can usually infer type arguments from a call based on the
type of the arguments, so type arguments are usually not needed.

Because TypeScript is structural, it doesn’t need type parameters as
much as nominal systems. Specifically, they are not needed to make a
function polymorphic. Type parameters should only be used to
 propagate type information, such as constraining parameters to be
the same type:



```id
tsfunction length<T extends ArrayLike<unknown>>(t: T): number {}function length(t: ArrayLike<unknown>): number {}
```



In the first `length`, T is not necessary; notice that it’s only
referenced once, so it’s not being used to constrain the type of the
return value or other parameters.

#### Higher-kinded types

TypeScript does not have higher kinded types, so the following is not legal:



```id
tsfunction length<T extends ArrayLike<unknown>, U>(m: T<U>) {}
```



#### Point-free programming

Point-free programming — heavy use of currying and function
composition — is possible in JavaScript, but can be verbose.
In TypeScript, type inference often fails for point-free programs, so
you’ll end up specifying type parameters instead of value parameters. The
result is so verbose that it’s usually better to avoid point-free
programming.

### Module system

JavaScript’s modern module syntax is a bit like Haskell’s, except that
any file with `import` or `export` is implicitly a module:



```id
tsimport { value, Type } from "npm-package";import { other, Types } from "./local-package";import * as prefix from "../lib/third-package";
```



You can also import commonjs modules — modules written using node.js’
module system:



```id
tsimport f = require("single-function-package");
```



You can export with an export list:



```id
tsexport { f };function f() {  return g();}function g() {} // g is not exported
```



Or by marking each export individually:



```id
tsexport function f() { return g() }function g() { }
```



The latter style is more common but both are allowed, even in the same
file.

### `readonly` and `const`

In JavaScript, mutability is the default, although it allows variable
declarations with `const` to declare that the reference is
immutable. The referent is still mutable:



```id
jsconst a = [1, 2, 3];a.push(102); // ):a[0] = 101; // D:
```



TypeScript additionally has a `readonly` modifier for properties.



```id
tsinterface Rx {  readonly x: number;}let rx: Rx = { x: 1 };rx.x = 12; // error
```



It also ships with a mapped type `Readonly ` that makes
all properties `readonly`:



```id
tsinterface X {  x: number;}let rx: Readonly<X> = { x: 1 };rx.x = 12; // error
```



And it has a specific `ReadonlyArray ` type that removes
side-affecting methods and prevents writing to indices of the array,
as well as special syntax for this type:



```id
tslet a: ReadonlyArray<number> = [1, 2, 3];let b: readonly number[] = [1, 2, 3];a.push(102); // errorb[0] = 101; // error
```



You can also use a const-assertion, which operates on arrays and
object literals:



```id
tslet a = [1, 2, 3] as const;a.push(102); // errora[0] = 101; // error
```



However, none of these options are the default, so they are not
consistently used in TypeScript code.

# Creating Types from Types

 

TypeScript’s type system is very powerful because it allows expressing types in terms of other types .

The simplest form of this idea is generics. Additionally, we have a wide variety of type operators available to use.
It’s also possible to express types in terms of values that we already have.

By combining various type operators, we can express complex operations and values in a succinct, maintainable way.
In this section we’ll cover ways to express a new type in terms of an existing type or value.

 Generics - Types which take parameters

- Keyof Type Operator - Using the `keyof` operator to create new types

- Typeof Type Operator - Using the `typeof` operator to create new types

- Indexed Access Types - Using `Type['a']` syntax to access a subset of a type

- Conditional Types - Types which act like if statements in the type system

- Mapped Types - Creating types by mapping each property in an existing type

- Template Literal Types - Mapped types which change properties via template literal strings

# TypeScript Tooling in 5 minutes

 

Let’s get started by building a simple web application with TypeScript.

## Installing TypeScript

There are two main ways to add TypeScript to your project:

 Via npm (the Node.js package manager)

- By installing TypeScript’s Visual Studio plugins

Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 include TypeScript language support by default but does not include the TypeScript compiler, `tsc`.
If you didn’t install TypeScript with Visual Studio, you can still download it .

For npm users:



```id
shell> npm install -g typescript
```



## Building your first TypeScript file

In your editor, type the following JavaScript code in `greeter.ts`:



```id
tsfunction greeter(person) {  return "Hello, " + person;} let user = "Jane User"; document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Try
```



## Compiling your code

We used a `.ts` extension, but this code is just JavaScript.
You could have copy/pasted this straight out of an existing JavaScript app.

At the command line, run the TypeScript compiler:



```id
shelltsc greeter.ts
```



The result will be a file `greeter.js` which contains the same JavaScript that you fed in.
We’re up and running using TypeScript in our JavaScript app!

Now we can start taking advantage of some of the new tools TypeScript offers.
Add a `: string` type annotation to the ‘person’ function parameter as shown here:



```id
tsfunction greeter(person: string) {  return "Hello, " + person;} let user = "Jane User"; document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Try
```



## Type annotations

Type annotations in TypeScript are lightweight ways to record the intended contract of the function or variable.
In this case, we intend the greeter function to be called with a single string parameter.
We can try changing the call greeter to pass an array instead:



```id
tsfunction greeter(person: string) {  return "Hello, " + person;} let user = [0, 1, 2]; document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.2345Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.Try
```



Re-compiling, you’ll now see an error:



```id
shellerror TS2345: Argument of type 'number[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```



Similarly, try removing all the arguments to the greeter call.
TypeScript will let you know that you have called this function with an unexpected number of arguments.
In both cases, TypeScript can offer static analysis based on both the structure of your code, and the type annotations you provide.

Notice that although there were errors, the `greeter.js` file is still created.
You can use TypeScript even if there are errors in your code. But in this case, TypeScript is warning that your code will likely not run as expected.

## Interfaces

Let’s develop our sample further. Here we use an interface that describes objects that have a firstName and lastName field.
In TypeScript, two types are compatible if their internal structure is compatible.
This allows us to implement an interface just by having the shape the interface requires, without an explicit `implements` clause.



```id
tsinterface Person {  firstName: string;  lastName: string;} function greeter(person: Person) {  return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;} let user = { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "User" }; document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Try
```



## Classes

Finally, let’s extend the example one last time with classes.
TypeScript supports new features in JavaScript, like support for class-based object-oriented programming.

Here we’re going to create a `Student` class with a constructor and a few public fields.
Notice that classes and interfaces play well together, letting the programmer decide on the right level of abstraction.

Also of note, the use of `public` on parameters to the constructor is a shorthand that allows us to automatically create properties with that name.



```id
tsclass Student {  fullName: string;  constructor(    public firstName: string,    public middleInitial: string,    public lastName: string  ) {    this.fullName = firstName + " " + middleInitial + " " + lastName;  }} interface Person {  firstName: string;  lastName: string;} function greeter(person: Person) {  return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;} let user = new Student("Jane", "M.", "User"); document.body.textContent = greeter(user);Try
```



Re-run `tsc greeter.ts` and you’ll see the generated JavaScript is the same as the earlier code.
Classes in TypeScript are just a shorthand for the same prototype-based OO that is frequently used in JavaScript.

## Running your TypeScript web app

Now type the following in `greeter.html`:



```id
html<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <title>TypeScript Greeter</title>  </head>  <body>    <script src="greeter.js"></script>  </body></html>
```



Open `greeter.html` in the browser to run your first simple TypeScript web application!

Optional: Open `greeter.ts` in Visual Studio, or copy the code into the TypeScript playground.
You can hover over identifiers to see their types.
Notice that in some cases these types are inferred automatically for you.
Re-type the last line, and see completion lists and parameter help based on the types of the DOM elements.
Put your cursor on the reference to the greeter function, and hit F12 to go to its definition.
Notice, too, that you can right-click on a symbol and use refactoring to rename it.

The type information provided works together with the tools to work with JavaScript at application scale.
For more examples of what’s possible in TypeScript, see the Samples section of the website.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Generics

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - Generics 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Generics

 

A major part of software engineering is building components that not only have well-defined and consistent APIs, but are also reusable.
Components that are capable of working on the data of today as well as the data of tomorrow will give you the most flexible capabilities for building up large software systems.

In languages like C# and Java, one of the main tools in the toolbox for creating reusable components is generics , that is, being able to create a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one.
This allows users to consume these components and use their own types.

## Hello World of Generics

To start off, let’s do the “hello world” of generics: the identity function.
The identity function is a function that will return back whatever is passed in.
You can think of this in a similar way to the `echo` command.

Without generics, we would either have to give the identity function a specific type:



```id
tsfunction identity(arg: number): number {  return arg;}Try
```



Or, we could describe the identity function using the `any` type:



```id
tsfunction identity(arg: any): any {  return arg;}Try
```



While using `any` is certainly generic in that it will cause the function to accept any and all types for the type of `arg`, we actually are losing the information about what that type was when the function returns.
If we passed in a number, the only information we have is that any type could be returned.

Instead, we need a way of capturing the type of the argument in such a way that we can also use it to denote what is being returned.
Here, we will use a type variable , a special kind of variable that works on types rather than values.



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;}Try
```



We’ve now added a type variable `Type` to the identity function.
This `Type` allows us to capture the type the user provides (e.g. `number`), so that we can use that information later.
Here, we use `Type` again as the return type. On inspection, we can now see the same type is used for the argument and the return type.
This allows us to traffic that type information in one side of the function and out the other.

We say that this version of the `identity` function is generic, as it works over a range of types.
Unlike using `any`, it’s also just as precise (i.e., it doesn’t lose any information) as the first `identity` function that used numbers for the argument and return type.

Once we’ve written the generic identity function, we can call it in one of two ways.
The first way is to pass all of the arguments, including the type argument, to the function:



```id
tslet output = (arg: string): string' >identity<string>("myString");      let output: stringTry
```



Here we explicitly set `Type` to be `string` as one of the arguments to the function call, denoted using the `<>` around the arguments rather than `()`.

The second way is also perhaps the most common. Here we use type argument inference — that is, we want the compiler to set the value of `Type` for us automatically based on the type of the argument we pass in:



```id
tslet output = (arg: "myString"): "myString"' >identity("myString");      let output: stringTry
```



Notice that we didn’t have to explicitly pass the type in the angle brackets (`<>`); the compiler just looked at the value `"myString"`, and set `Type` to its type.
While type argument inference can be a helpful tool to keep code shorter and more readable, you may need to explicitly pass in the type arguments as we did in the previous example when the compiler fails to infer the type, as may happen in more complex examples.

## Working with Generic Type Variables

When you begin to use generics, you’ll notice that when you create generic functions like `identity`, the compiler will enforce that you use any generically typed parameters in the body of the function correctly.
That is, that you actually treat these parameters as if they could be any and all types.

Let’s take our `identity` function from earlier:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;}Try
```



What if we want to also log the length of the argument `arg` to the console with each call?
We might be tempted to write this:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  console.log(arg.length);Property 'length' does not exist on type 'Type'.2339Property 'length' does not exist on type 'Type'.  return arg;}Try
```



When we do, the compiler will give us an error that we’re using the `.length` member of `arg`, but nowhere have we said that `arg` has this member.
Remember, we said earlier that these type variables stand in for any and all types, so someone using this function could have passed in a `number` instead, which does not have a `.length` member.

Let’s say that we’ve actually intended this function to work on arrays of `Type` rather than `Type` directly. Since we’re working with arrays, the `.length` member should be available.
We can describe this just like we would create arrays of other types:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type[]): Type[]' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Type[]): Type[]' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[]): (arg: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[] {  console.log(arg..length: number' >length);  return arg;}Try
```



You can read the type of `loggingIdentity` as “the generic function `loggingIdentity` takes a type parameter `Type`, and an argument `arg` which is an array of `Type`s, and returns an array of `Type`s.”
If we passed in an array of numbers, we’d get an array of numbers back out, as `Type` would bind to `number`.
This allows us to use our generic type variable `Type` as part of the types we’re working with, rather than the whole type, giving us greater flexibility.

We can alternatively write the sample example this way:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type>' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type>' >Type>(arg: ' >Array<(arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type>' >Type>): ' >Array<(arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type>' >Type> {  console.log(arg..length: number' >length); // Array has a .length, so no more error  return arg;}Try
```



You may already be familiar with this style of type from other languages.
In the next section, we’ll cover how you can create your own generic types like `Array `.

## Generic Types

In previous sections, we created generic identity functions that worked over a range of types.
In this section, we’ll explore the type of the functions themselves and how to create generic interfaces.

The type of generic functions is just like those of non-generic functions, with the type parameters listed first, similarly to function declarations:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let (arg: Type) => Type' >myIdentity: <(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type) => (arg: Type): Type' >Type = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



We could also have used a different name for the generic type parameter in the type, so long as the number of type variables and how the type variables are used line up.



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let (arg: Input) => Input' >myIdentity: <(arg: Input): Input' >Input>(arg: (arg: Input): Input' >Input) => (arg: Input): Input' >Input = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



We can also write the generic type as a call signature of an object literal type:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let (arg: Type) => Type' >myIdentity: { <(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type } = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



Which leads us to writing our first generic interface.
Let’s take the object literal from the previous example and move it to an interface:



```id
tsinterface GenericIdentityFn {  <(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type;} function (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



In a similar example, we may want to move the generic parameter to be a parameter of the whole interface.
This lets us see what type(s) we’re generic over (e.g. `Dictionary ` rather than just `Dictionary`).
This makes the type parameter visible to all the other members of the interface.



```id
tsinterface ' >GenericIdentityFn<' >Type> {  (arg: ' >Type): ' >Type;} function (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let ' >myIdentity: ' >GenericIdentityFn<number> = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



Notice that our example has changed to be something slightly different.
Instead of describing a generic function, we now have a non-generic function signature that is a part of a generic type.
When we use `GenericIdentityFn`, we now will also need to specify the corresponding type argument (here: `number`), effectively locking in what the underlying call signature will use.
Understanding when to put the type parameter directly on the call signature and when to put it on the interface itself will be helpful in describing what aspects of a type are generic.

In addition to generic interfaces, we can also create generic classes.
Note that it is not possible to create generic enums and namespaces.

## Generic Classes

A generic class has a similar shape to a generic interface.
Generic classes have a generic type parameter list in angle brackets (`<>`) following the name of the class.



```id
tsclass ' >GenericNumber<' >NumType> {  .zeroValue: NumType' >zeroValue: ' >NumType;  .add: (x: NumType, y: NumType) => NumType' >add: (x: ' >NumType, y: ' >NumType) => ' >NumType;} let ' >myGenericNumber = new (): GenericNumber<number>' >GenericNumber<number>();' >myGenericNumber..zeroValue: number' >zeroValue = 0;' >myGenericNumber..add: (x: number, y: number) => number' >add = function (x, y) {  return x + y;};Try
```



This is a pretty literal use of the `GenericNumber` class, but you may have noticed that nothing is restricting it to only use the `number` type.
We could have instead used `string` or even more complex objects.



```id
tslet ' >stringNumeric = new (): GenericNumber<string>' >GenericNumber<string>();' >stringNumeric..zeroValue: string' >zeroValue = "";' >stringNumeric..add: (x: string, y: string) => string' >add = function (x, y) {  return x + y;}; console.log(' >stringNumeric..add: (x: string, y: string) => string' >add(' >stringNumeric..zeroValue: string' >zeroValue, "test"));Try
```



Just as with interface, putting the type parameter on the class itself lets us make sure all of the properties of the class are working with the same type.

As we cover in our section on classes , a class has two sides to its type: the static side and the instance side.
Generic classes are only generic over their instance side rather than their static side, so when working with classes, static members can not use the class’s type parameter.

## Generic Constraints

If you remember from an earlier example, you may sometimes want to write a generic function that works on a set of types where you have some knowledge about what capabilities that set of types will have.
In our `loggingIdentity` example, we wanted to be able to access the `.length` property of `arg`, but the compiler could not prove that every type had a `.length` property, so it warns us that we can’t make this assumption.



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  console.log(arg.length);Property 'length' does not exist on type 'Type'.2339Property 'length' does not exist on type 'Type'.  return arg;}Try
```



Instead of working with any and all types, we’d like to constrain this function to work with any and all types that also   have the `.length` property.
As long as the type has this member, we’ll allow it, but it’s required to have at least this member.
To do so, we must list our requirement as a constraint on what `Type` can be.

To do so, we’ll create an interface that describes our constraint.
Here, we’ll create an interface that has a single `.length` property and then we’ll use this interface and the `extends` keyword to denote our constraint:



```id
tsinterface Lengthwise {  length: number;} function (arg: Type): Type' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type extends Lengthwise>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  console.log(arg.length); // Now we know it has a .length property, so no more error  return arg;}Try
```



Because the generic function is now constrained, it will no longer work over any and all types:



```id
ts(arg: Lengthwise): Lengthwise' >loggingIdentity(3);Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Lengthwise'.2345Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Lengthwise'.Try
```



Instead, we need to pass in values whose type has all the required properties:



```id
ts(arg: {
    length: number;
    value: number;
}): {
    length: number;
    value: number;
}' >loggingIdentity({ length: 10, value: 3 });Try
```



## Using Type Parameters in Generic Constraints

You can declare a type parameter that is constrained by another type parameter.
For example, here we’d like to get a property from an object given its name.
We’d like to ensure that we’re not accidentally grabbing a property that does not exist on the `obj`, so we’ll place a constraint between the two types:



```id
tsfunction (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >getProperty<(obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Type, (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Key extends keyof (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Type>(obj: (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Type, key: (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Key) {  return obj[key];} let x = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }; (obj: {
    a: number;
    b: number;
    c: number;
    d: number;
}, key: "a"): number' >getProperty(x, "a");(obj: {
    a: number;
    b: number;
    c: number;
    d: number;
}, key: "a" | "b" | "c" | "d"): number' >getProperty(x, "m");Argument of type '"m"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"a" | "b" | "c" | "d"'.2345Argument of type '"m"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"a" | "b" | "c" | "d"'.Try
```



## Using Class Types in Generics

When creating factories in TypeScript using generics, it is necessary to refer to class types by their constructor functions. For example,



```id
tsfunction (c: {
    new (): Type;
}): Type' >create<(c: {
    new (): Type;
}): Type' >Type>( Type' >c: { new (): (c: {
    new (): Type;
}): Type' >Type }): (c: {
    new (): Type;
}): Type' >Type {  return new  Type' >c();}Try
```



A more advanced example uses the prototype property to infer and constrain relationships between the constructor function and the instance side of class types.



```id
tsclass BeeKeeper {  hasMask: boolean = true;} class ZooKeeper {  nametag: string = "Mikle";} class Animal {  numLegs: number = 4;} class Bee extends Animal {  numLegs = 6;  keeper: BeeKeeper = new BeeKeeper();} class Lion extends Animal {  keeper: ZooKeeper = new ZooKeeper();} function (c: new () => A): A' >createInstance<(c: new () => A): A' >A extends Animal>( A' >c: new () => (c: new () => A): A' >A): (c: new () => A): A' >A {  return new  A' >c();} (c: new () => Lion): Lion' >createInstance(Lion).keeper.nametag;(c: new () => Bee): Bee' >createInstance(Bee).keeper.hasMask;Try
```



This pattern is used to power the mixins design pattern.

## Generic Parameter Defaults

By declaring a default for a generic type parameter, you make it optional to specify the corresponding type argument. For example, a function which creates a new `HTMLElement`. Calling the function with no arguments generates a `HTMLDivElement`; calling the function with an element as the first argument generates an element of the argument’s type. You can optionally pass a list of children as well. Previously you would have to define the function as:



```id
tsdeclare function  (+2 overloads)' >create():  = {
    element: T;
    children: U;
}' >Container<HTMLDivElement, HTMLDivElement[]>;declare function (element: T): Container<T, T[]> (+2 overloads)' >create<(element: T): Container<T, T[]>' >T extends HTMLElement>(element: (element: T): Container<T, T[]>' >T):  = {
    element: T;
    children: U;
}' >Container<(element: T): Container<T, T[]>' >T, (element: T): Container<T, T[]>' >T[]>;declare function (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]> (+2 overloads)' >create<(element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >T extends HTMLElement, (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >U extends HTMLElement>(  element: (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >T,  children: (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >U[]):  = {
    element: T;
    children: U;
}' >Container<(element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >T, (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >U[]>;Try
```



With generic parameter defaults we can reduce it to:



```id
tsdeclare function (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >create<(element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >T extends HTMLElement = HTMLDivElement, (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >U extends HTMLElement[] = (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >T[]>(  element?: (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >T,  children?: (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >U):  = {
    element: T;
    children: U;
}' >Container<(element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >T, (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >U>; const ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>div = (element?: HTMLDivElement | undefined, children?: HTMLDivElement[] | undefined): Container<HTMLDivElement, HTMLDivElement[]>' >create();      const div: Container<HTMLDivElement, HTMLDivElement[]> const ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>p = (element?: HTMLParagraphElement | undefined, children?: HTMLParagraphElement[] | undefined): Container<HTMLParagraphElement, HTMLParagraphElement[]>' >create(new  HTMLParagraphElement' >HTMLParagraphElement());     const p: Container<HTMLParagraphElement, HTMLParagraphElement[]>Try
```



A generic parameter default follows the following rules:

 A type parameter is deemed optional if it has a default.

- Required type parameters must not follow optional type parameters.

- Default types for a type parameter must satisfy the constraint for the type parameter, if it exists.

- When specifying type arguments, you are only required to specify type arguments for the required type parameters. Unspecified type parameters will resolve to their default types.

- If a default type is specified and inference cannot choose a candidate, the default type is inferred.

- A class or interface declaration that merges with an existing class or interface declaration may introduce a default for an existing type parameter.

- A class or interface declaration that merges with an existing class or interface declaration may introduce a new type parameter as long as it specifies a default.

## Variance Annotations

 

This is an advanced feature for solving a very specific problem, and should only be used in situations where you’ve identified a reason to use it

 

 Covariance and contravariance are type theory terms that describe what the relationship between two generic types is.
Here’s a brief primer on the concept.

For example, if you have an interface representing an object that can `make` a certain type:



```id
tsinterface Producer<T> {  make(): T;}
```



We can use a `Producer ` where a `Producer ` is expected, because a `Cat` is an `Animal`.
This relationship is called covariance : the relationship from `Producer ` to `Producer ` is the same as the relationship from `T` to `U`.

Conversely, if you have an interface that can `consume` a certain type:



```id
tsinterface Consumer<T> {  consume: (arg: T) => void;}
```



Then we can use a `Consumer ` where a `Consumer ` is expected, because any function that is capable of accepting an `Animal` must also be capable of accepting a `Cat`.
This relationship is called contravariance : the relationship from `Consumer ` to `Consumer ` is the same as the relationship from `U` to `T`.
Note the reversal of direction as compared to covariance! This is why contravariance “cancels itself out” but covariance doesn’t.

In a structural type system like TypeScript’s, covariance and contravariance are naturally emergent behaviors that follow from the definition of types.
Even in the absence of generics, we would see covariant (and contravariant) relationships:



```id
tsinterface AnimalProducer {  make(): Animal;}// A CatProducer can be used anywhere an// Animal producer is expectedinterface CatProducer {  make(): Cat;}
```



TypeScript has a structural type system, so when comparing two types, e.g. to see if a `Producer ` can be used where a `Producer ` is expected, the usual algorithm would be structurally expand both of those definitions, and compare their structures.
However, variance allows for an extremely useful optimization: if `Producer ` is covariant on `T`, then we can simply check `Cat` and `Animal` instead, as we know they’ll have the same relationship as `Producer ` and `Producer `.

Note that this logic can only be used when we’re examining two instantiations of the same type.
If we have a `Producer ` and a `FastProducer `, there’s no guarantee that `T` and `U` necessarily refer to the same positions in these types, so this check will always be performed structurally.

Because variance is a naturally emergent property of structural types, TypeScript automatically infers the variance of every generic type.
 In extremely rare cases involving certain kinds of circular types, this measurement can be inaccurate.
If this happens, you can add a variance annotation to a type parameter to force a particular variance:



```id
ts// Contravariant annotationinterface Consumer<in T> {  consume: (arg: T) => void;}// Covariant annotationinterface Producer<out T> {  make(): T;}// Invariant annotationinterface ProducerConsumer<in out T> {  consume: (arg: T) => void;  make(): T;}
```



Only do this if you are writing the same variance that should occur structurally.

 

Never write a variance annotation that doesn’t match the structural variance!

 

It’s critical to reinforce that variance annotations are only in effect during an instantiation-based comparison.
They have no effect during a structural comparison.
For example, you can’t use variance annotations to “force” a type to be actually invariant:



```id
ts// DON'T DO THIS - variance annotation// does not match structural behaviorinterface Producer<in out T> {  make(): T;}// Not a type error -- this is a structural// comparison, so variance annotations are// not in effectconst p: Producer<string | number> = {    make(): number {        return 42;    }}
```



Here, the object literal’s `make` function returns `number`, which we might expect to cause an error because `number` isn’t `string | number`.
However, this isn’t an instantiation-based comparison, because the object literal is an anonymous type, not a `Producer `.

 

Variance annotations don’t change structural behavior and are only consulted in specific situations

 

It’s very important to only write variance annotations if you absolutely know why you’re doing it, what their limitations are, and when they aren’t in effect.
Whether TypeScript uses an instantiation-based comparison or structural comparison is not a specified behavior and may change from version to version for correctness or performance reasons, so you should only ever write variance annotations when they match the structural behavior of a type.
Don’t use variance annotations to try to “force” a particular variance; this will cause unpredictable behavior in your code.

 

Do NOT write variance annotations unless they match the structural behavior of a type

 

Remember, TypeScript can automatically infer variance from your generic types.
It’s almost never necessary to write a variance annotation, and you should only do so when you’ve identified a specific need.
Variance annotations do not change the structural behavior of a type, and depending on the situation, you might see a structural comparison made when you expected an instantiation-based comparison.
Variance annotations can’t be used to modify how types behave in these structural contexts, and shouldn’t be written unless the annotation is the same as the structural definition.
Because this is difficult to get right, and TypeScript can correctly infer variance in the vast majority of cases, you should not find yourself writing variance annotations in normal code.

 

Don’t try to use variance annotations to change typechecking behavior; this is not what they are for

 

You may find temporary variance annotations useful in a “type debugging” situation, because variance annotations are checked.
TypeScript will issue an error if the annotated variance is identifiably wrong:



```id
ts// Error, this interface is definitely contravariant on Tinterface Foo<out T> {  consume: (arg: T) => void;}
```



However, variance annotations are allowed to be stricter (e.g. `in out` is valid if the actual variance is covariant).
Be sure to remove your variance annotations once you’re done debugging.

Lastly, if you’re trying to maximize your typechecking performance, and have run a profiler, and have identified a specific type that’s slow, and have identified variance inference specifically is slow, and have carefully validated the variance annotation you want to write, you may see a small performance benefit in extraordinarily complex types by adding variance annotations.

 

Don’t try to use variance annotations to change typechecking behavior; this is not what they are for

# The Basics

 

Welcome to the first page of the handbook. If this is your first experience with TypeScript - you may want to start at one of the ' Getting Started ' guides 
 Each and every value in JavaScript has a set of behaviors you can observe from running different operations.
That sounds abstract, but as a quick example, consider some operations we might run on a variable named `message`.



```id
js// Accessing the property 'toLowerCase'// on 'message' and then calling itmessage.toLowerCase();// Calling 'message'message();
```



If we break this down, the first runnable line of code accesses a property called `toLowerCase` and then calls it.
The second one tries to call `message` directly.

But assuming we don’t know the value of `message` - and that’s pretty common - we can’t reliably say what results we’ll get from trying to run any of this code.
The behavior of each operation depends entirely on what value we had in the first place.

 Is `message` callable?

- Does it have a property called `toLowerCase` on it?

- If it does, is `toLowerCase` even callable?

- If both of these values are callable, what do they return?

The answers to these questions are usually things we keep in our heads when we write JavaScript, and we have to hope we got all the details right.

Let’s say `message` was defined in the following way.



```id
jsconst message = "Hello World!";
```



As you can probably guess, if we try to run `message.toLowerCase()`, we’ll get the same string only in lower-case.

What about that second line of code?
If you’re familiar with JavaScript, you’ll know this fails with an exception:



```id
txtTypeError: message is not a function
```



It’d be great if we could avoid mistakes like this.

When we run our code, the way that our JavaScript runtime chooses what to do is by figuring out the type of the value - what sorts of behaviors and capabilities it has.
That’s part of what that `TypeError` is alluding to - it’s saying that the string `"Hello World!"` cannot be called as a function.

For some values, such as the primitives `string` and `number`, we can identify their type at runtime using the `typeof` operator.
But for other things like functions, there’s no corresponding runtime mechanism to identify their types.
For example, consider this function:



```id
jsfunction fn(x) {  return x.flip();}
```



We can observe by reading the code that this function will only work if given an object with a callable `flip` property, but JavaScript doesn’t surface this information in a way that we can check while the code is running.
The only way in pure JavaScript to tell what `fn` does with a particular value is to call it and see what happens.
This kind of behavior makes it hard to predict what the code will do before it runs, which means it’s harder to know what your code is going to do while you’re writing it.

Seen in this way, a type is the concept of describing which values can be passed to `fn` and which will crash.
JavaScript only truly provides dynamic typing - running the code to see what happens.

The alternative is to use a static type system to make predictions about what the code is expected to do before it runs.

## Static type-checking

Think back to that `TypeError` we got earlier from trying to call a `string` as a function.
 Most people don’t like to get any sorts of errors when running their code - those are considered bugs!
And when we write new code, we try our best to avoid introducing new bugs.

If we add just a bit of code, save our file, re-run the code, and immediately see the error, we might be able to isolate the problem quickly; but that’s not always the case.
We might not have tested the feature thoroughly enough, so we might never actually run into a potential error that would be thrown!
Or if we were lucky enough to witness the error, we might have ended up doing large refactorings and adding a lot of different code that we’re forced to dig through.

Ideally, we could have a tool that helps us find these bugs before our code runs.
That’s what a static type-checker like TypeScript does.
 Static type systems describe the shapes and behaviors of what our values will be when we run our programs.
A type-checker like TypeScript uses that information and tells us when things might be going off the rails.



```id
tsconst message = "hello!"; message();This expression is not callable.
  Type 'String' has no call signatures.2349This expression is not callable.
  Type 'String' has no call signatures.Try
```



Running that last sample with TypeScript will give us an error message before we run the code in the first place.

## Non-exception Failures

So far we’ve been discussing certain things like runtime errors - cases where the JavaScript runtime tells us that it thinks something is nonsensical.
Those cases come up because the ECMAScript specification has explicit instructions on how the language should behave when it runs into something unexpected.

For example, the specification says that trying to call something that isn’t callable should throw an error.
Maybe that sounds like “obvious behavior”, but you could imagine that accessing a property that doesn’t exist on an object should throw an error too.
Instead, JavaScript gives us different behavior and returns the value `undefined`:



```id
jsconst user = {  name: "Daniel",  age: 26,};user.location; // returns undefined
```



Ultimately, a static type system has to make the call over what code should be flagged as an error in its system, even if it’s “valid” JavaScript that won’t immediately throw an error.
In TypeScript, the following code produces an error about `location` not being defined:



```id
tsconst user = {  name: "Daniel",  age: 26,}; user.location;Property 'location' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.2339Property 'location' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.Try
```



While sometimes that implies a trade-off in what you can express, the intent is to catch legitimate bugs in our programs.
And TypeScript catches a lot of legitimate bugs.

For example: typos,



```id
tsconst announcement = "Hello World!"; // How quickly can you spot the typos?announcement.toLocaleLowercase();announcement.toLocalLowerCase(); // We probably meant to write this...announcement.toLocaleLowerCase();Try
```



uncalled functions,



```id
tsfunction flipCoin() {  // Meant to be Math.random()  return Math.random < 0.5;Operator '<' cannot be applied to types '() => number' and 'number'.2365Operator '<' cannot be applied to types '() => number' and 'number'.}Try
```



or basic logic errors.



```id
tsconst value = Math.random() < 0.5 ? "a" : "b";if (value !== "a") {  // ...} else if (value === "b") {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"a"' and '"b"' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"a"' and '"b"' have no overlap.  // Oops, unreachable}Try
```



## Types for Tooling

TypeScript can catch bugs when we make mistakes in our code.
That’s great, but TypeScript can also prevent us from making those mistakes in the first place.

The type-checker has information to check things like whether we’re accessing the right properties on variables and other properties.
Once it has that information, it can also start suggesting which properties you might want to use.

That means TypeScript can be leveraged for editing code too, and the core type-checker can provide error messages and code completion as you type in the editor.
That’s part of what people often refer to when they talk about tooling in TypeScript.

 


```id
tsimport express from "express";const app = express(); app.>.get: <"/", {}, any, any, QueryString.ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>(path: "/", ...handlers: RequestHandler<{}, any, any, QueryString.ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>[]) => Express (+5 overloads)' >get("/", function (>' >req, , number>' >res) {  , number>' >res.sen
sendsendDatesendfilesendFilesendStatus}); app.>.listen(port: number, callback?: () => void): Server (+5 overloads)' >listen(3000);Try

TypeScript takes tooling seriously, and that goes beyond completions and errors as you type.
An editor that supports TypeScript can deliver “quick fixes” to automatically fix errors, refactorings to easily re-organize code, and useful navigation features for jumping to definitions of a variable, or finding all references to a given variable.
All of this is built on top of the type-checker and is fully cross-platform, so it’s likely that your favorite editor has TypeScript support available .

## `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler

We’ve been talking about type-checking, but we haven’t yet used our type- checker .
Let’s get acquainted with our new friend `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler.
First we’ll need to grab it via npm.



```id
shnpm install -g typescript
```


 

This installs the TypeScript Compiler `tsc` globally.
You can use `npx` or similar tools if you’d prefer to run `tsc` from a local `node_modules` package instead.

 

Now let’s move to an empty folder and try writing our first TypeScript program: `hello.ts`:



```id
ts// Greets the world.console.log("Hello world!");Try
```



Notice there are no frills here; this “hello world” program looks identical to what you’d write for a “hello world” program in JavaScript.
And now let’s type-check it by running the command `tsc` which was installed for us by the `typescript` package.



```id
shtsc hello.ts
```



Tada!

Wait, “tada” what exactly?
We ran `tsc` and nothing happened!
Well, there were no type errors, so we didn’t get any output in our console since there was nothing to report.

But check again - we got some file output instead.
If we look in our current directory, we’ll see a `hello.js` file next to `hello.ts`.
That’s the output from our `hello.ts` file after `tsc` compiles or transforms it into a plain JavaScript file.
And if we check the contents, we’ll see what TypeScript spits out after it processes a `.ts` file:



```id
js// Greets the world.console.log("Hello world!");
```



In this case, there was very little for TypeScript to transform, so it looks identical to what we wrote.
The compiler tries to emit clean readable code that looks like something a person would write.
While that’s not always so easy, TypeScript indents consistently, is mindful of when our code spans across different lines of code, and tries to keep comments around.

What about if we did introduce a type-checking error?
Let’s rewrite `hello.ts`:



```id
ts// This is an industrial-grade general-purpose greeter function:function greet(person, date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date}!`);} greet("Brendan");Try
```



If we run `tsc hello.ts` again, notice that we get an error on the command line!



```id
txtExpected 2 arguments, but got 1.
```



TypeScript is telling us we forgot to pass an argument to the `greet` function, and rightfully so.
So far we’ve only written standard JavaScript, and yet type-checking was still able to find problems with our code.
Thanks TypeScript!

## Emitting with Errors

One thing you might not have noticed from the last example was that our `hello.js` file changed again.
If we open that file up then we’ll see that the contents still basically look the same as our input file.
That might be a bit surprising given the fact that `tsc` reported an error about our code, but this is based on one of TypeScript’s core values: much of the time, you will know better than TypeScript.

To reiterate from earlier, type-checking code limits the sorts of programs you can run, and so there’s a tradeoff on what sorts of things a type-checker finds acceptable.
Most of the time that’s okay, but there are scenarios where those checks get in the way.
For example, imagine yourself migrating JavaScript code over to TypeScript and introducing type-checking errors.
Eventually you’ll get around to cleaning things up for the type-checker, but that original JavaScript code was already working!
Why should converting it over to TypeScript stop you from running it?

So TypeScript doesn’t get in your way.
Of course, over time, you may want to be a bit more defensive against mistakes, and make TypeScript act a bit more strictly.
In that case, you can use the `noEmitOnError` compiler option.
Try changing your `hello.ts` file and running `tsc` with that flag:



```id
shtsc --noEmitOnError hello.ts
```



You’ll notice that `hello.js` never gets updated.

## Explicit Types

Up until now, we haven’t told TypeScript what `person` or `date` are.
Let’s edit the code to tell TypeScript that `person` is a `string`, and that `date` should be a `Date` object.
We’ll also use the `toDateString()` method on `date`.



```id
tsfunction greet(person: string, date: Date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);}Try
```



What we did was add type annotations on `person` and `date` to describe what types of values `greet` can be called with.
You can read that signature as ”`greet` takes a `person` of type `string`, and a `date` of type `Date`“.

With this, TypeScript can tell us about other cases where `greet` might have been called incorrectly.
For example…



```id
tsfunction greet(person: string, date: Date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);} greet("Maddison",  string' >Date());Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Date'.2345Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Date'.Try
```



Huh?
TypeScript reported an error on our second argument, but why?

Perhaps surprisingly, calling `Date()` in JavaScript returns a `string`.
On the other hand, constructing a `Date` with `new Date()` actually gives us what we were expecting.

Anyway, we can quickly fix up the error:



```id
tsfunction greet(person: string, date: Date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);} greet("Maddison", new  Date (+4 overloads)' >Date());Try
```



Keep in mind, we don’t always have to write explicit type annotations.
In many cases, TypeScript can even just infer (or “figure out”) the types for us even if we omit them.



```id
tslet msg = "hello there!";    let msg: stringTry
```



Even though we didn’t tell TypeScript that `msg` had the type `string` it was able to figure that out.
That’s a feature, and it’s best not to add annotations when the type system would end up inferring the same type anyway.

 

Note: The message bubble inside the previous code sample is what your editor would show if you had hovered over the word.

 

## Erased Types

Let’s take a look at what happens when we compile the above function `greet` with `tsc` to output JavaScript:



```id
ts"use strict";function greet(person, date) {    console.log("Hello ".concat(person, ", today is ").concat(date.toDateString(), "!"));}greet("Maddison", new Date()); Try
```



Notice two things here:

- Our `person` and `date` parameters no longer have type annotations.

- Our “template string” - that string that used backticks (the ``` character) - was converted to plain strings with concatenations.

More on that second point later, but let’s now focus on that first point.
Type annotations aren’t part of JavaScript (or ECMAScript to be pedantic), so there really aren’t any browsers or other runtimes that can just run TypeScript unmodified.
That’s why TypeScript needs a compiler in the first place - it needs some way to strip out or transform any TypeScript-specific code so that you can run it.
Most TypeScript-specific code gets erased away, and likewise, here our type annotations were completely erased.

 

 Remember : Type annotations never change the runtime behavior of your program.

 

## Downleveling

One other difference from the above was that our template string was rewritten from



```id
js`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`;
```



to



```id
js"Hello ".concat(person, ", today is ").concat(date.toDateString(), "!");
```



Why did this happen?

Template strings are a feature from a version of ECMAScript called ECMAScript 2015 (a.k.a. ECMAScript 6, ES2015, ES6, etc. - don’t ask ).
TypeScript has the ability to rewrite code from newer versions of ECMAScript to older ones such as ECMAScript 3 or ECMAScript 5 (a.k.a. ES5).
This process of moving from a newer or “higher” version of ECMAScript down to an older or “lower” one is sometimes called downleveling .

By default TypeScript targets ES5, an extremely old version of ECMAScript.
We could have chosen something a little bit more recent by using the `target` option.
Running with `--target es2015` changes TypeScript to target ECMAScript 2015, meaning code should be able to run wherever ECMAScript 2015 is supported.
So running `tsc --target es2015 hello.ts` gives us the following output:



```id
jsfunction greet(person, date) {  console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);}greet("Maddison", new Date());
```


 

While the default target is ES5, the great majority of current browsers support ES2015.
Most developers can therefore safely specify ES2015 or above as a target, unless compatibility with certain ancient browsers is important.

 

## Strictness

Different users come to TypeScript looking for different things in a type-checker.
Some people are looking for a more loose opt-in experience which can help validate only some parts of their program, and still have decent tooling.
This is the default experience with TypeScript, where types are optional, inference takes the most lenient types, and there’s no checking for potentially `null`/`undefined` values.
Much like how `tsc` emits in the face of errors, these defaults are put in place to stay out of your way.
If you’re migrating existing JavaScript, that might be a desirable first step.

In contrast, a lot of users prefer to have TypeScript validate as much as it can straight away, and that’s why the language provides strictness settings as well.
These strictness settings turn static type-checking from a switch (either your code is checked or not) into something closer to a dial.
The further you turn this dial up, the more TypeScript will check for you.
This can require a little extra work, but generally speaking it pays for itself in the long run, and enables more thorough checks and more accurate tooling.
When possible, a new codebase should always turn these strictness checks on.

TypeScript has several type-checking strictness flags that can be turned on or off, and all of our examples will be written with all of them enabled unless otherwise stated.
The `strict` flag in the CLI, or `"strict": true` in a `tsconfig.json` toggles them all on simultaneously, but we can opt out of them individually.
The two biggest ones you should know about are `noImplicitAny` and `strictNullChecks` .

## `noImplicitAny`

Recall that in some places, TypeScript doesn’t try to infer types for us and instead falls back to the most lenient type: `any`.
This isn’t the worst thing that can happen - after all, falling back to `any` is just the plain JavaScript experience anyway.

However, using `any` often defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place.
The more typed your program is, the more validation and tooling you’ll get, meaning you’ll run into fewer bugs as you code.
Turning on the `noImplicitAny` flag will issue an error on any variables whose type is implicitly inferred as `any`.

## `strictNullChecks`

By default, values like `null` and `undefined` are assignable to any other type.
This can make writing some code easier, but forgetting to handle `null` and `undefined` is the cause of countless bugs in the world - some consider it a billion dollar mistake !
The `strictNullChecks` flag makes handling `null` and `undefined` more explicit, and spares us from worrying about whether we forgot to handle `null` and `undefined`.

# Keyof Type Operator

 

## The `keyof` type operator

The `keyof` operator takes an object type and produces a string or numeric literal union of its keys.
The following type `P` is the same type as `type P = "x" | "y"`:



```id
tstype Point = { x: number; y: number };type P = keyof Point;    type P = keyof PointTry
```



If the type has a `string` or `number` index signature, `keyof` will return those types instead:



```id
tstype Arrayish = { [n: number]: unknown };type A = keyof Arrayish;    type A = number type Mapish = { [k: string]: boolean };type M = keyof Mapish;    type M = string | numberTry
```



Note that in this example, `M` is `string | number` — this is because JavaScript object keys are always coerced to a string, so `obj[0]` is always the same as `obj["0"]`.

`keyof` types become especially useful when combined with mapped types, which we’ll learn more about later.

# Everyday Types

 

In this chapter, we’ll cover some of the most common types of values you’ll find in JavaScript code, and explain the corresponding ways to describe those types in TypeScript.
This isn’t an exhaustive list, and future chapters will describe more ways to name and use other types.

Types can also appear in many more places than just type annotations.
As we learn about the types themselves, we’ll also learn about the places where we can refer to these types to form new constructs.

We’ll start by reviewing the most basic and common types you might encounter when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code.
These will later form the core building blocks of more complex types.

## The primitives: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`

JavaScript has three very commonly used primitives : `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript.
As you might expect, these are the same names you’d see if you used the JavaScript `typeof` operator on a value of those types:

 `string` represents string values like `"Hello, world"`

- `number` is for numbers like `42`. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there’s no equivalent to `int` or `float` - everything is simply `number`

- `boolean` is for the two values `true` and `false`

 

The type names `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code. Always use `string`, `number`, or `boolean` for types.

 

## Arrays

To specify the type of an array like `[1, 2, 3]`, you can use the syntax `number[]`; this syntax works for any type (e.g. `string[]` is an array of strings, and so on).
You may also see this written as `Array `, which means the same thing.
We’ll learn more about the syntax `T ` when we cover generics .

 

Note that `[number]` is a different thing; refer to the section on Tuples .

 

## `any`

TypeScript also has a special type, `any`, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

When a value is of type `any`, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type `any`), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal:



```id
tslet obj: any = { x: 0 };// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed// you know the environment better than TypeScript.obj.foo();obj();obj.bar = 100;obj = "hello";const n: number = obj;Try
```



The `any` type is useful when you don’t want to write out a long type just to convince TypeScript that a particular line of code is okay.

### `noImplicitAny`

When you don’t specify a type, and TypeScript can’t infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to `any`.

You usually want to avoid this, though, because `any` isn’t type-checked.
Use the compiler flag `noImplicitAny` to flag any implicit `any` as an error.

## Type Annotations on Variables

When you declare a variable using `const`, `var`, or `let`, you can optionally add a type annotation to explicitly specify the type of the variable:



```id
tslet myName: string = "Alice";Try
```


 

TypeScript doesn’t use “types on the left”-style declarations like `int x = 0;`
Type annotations will always go after the thing being typed.

 

In most cases, though, this isn’t needed.
Wherever possible, TypeScript tries to automatically infer the types in your code.
For example, the type of a variable is inferred based on the type of its initializer:



```id
ts// No type annotation needed -- &apos;myName&apos; inferred as type &apos;string&apos;let myName = "Alice";Try
```



For the most part you don’t need to explicitly learn the rules of inference.
If you’re starting out, try using fewer type annotations than you think - you might be surprised how few you need for TypeScript to fully understand what’s going on.

## Functions

Functions are the primary means of passing data around in JavaScript.
TypeScript allows you to specify the types of both the input and output values of functions.

### Parameter Type Annotations

When you declare a function, you can add type annotations after each parameter to declare what types of parameters the function accepts.
Parameter type annotations go after the parameter name:



```id
ts// Parameter type annotationfunction greet(name: string) {  console.log("Hello, " + name.toUpperCase() + "!!");}Try
```



When a parameter has a type annotation, arguments to that function will be checked:



```id
ts// Would be a runtime error if executed!greet(42);Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.2345Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.Try
```


 

Even if you don’t have type annotations on your parameters, TypeScript will still check that you passed the right number of arguments.

 

### Return Type Annotations

You can also add return type annotations.
Return type annotations appear after the parameter list:



```id
tsfunction getFavoriteNumber(): number {  return 26;}Try
```



Much like variable type annotations, you usually don’t need a return type annotation because TypeScript will infer the function’s return type based on its `return` statements.
The type annotation in the above example doesn’t change anything.
Some codebases will explicitly specify a return type for documentation purposes, to prevent accidental changes, or just for personal preference.

#### Functions Which Return Promises

If you want to annotate the return type of a function which returns a promise, you should use the `Promise` type:



```id
tsasync function ' >getFavoriteNumber(): ' >Promise<number> {  return 26;}Try
```



### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are a little bit different from function declarations.
When a function appears in a place where TypeScript can determine how it’s going to be called, the parameters of that function are automatically given types.

Here’s an example:



```id
tsconst names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]; // Contextual typing for function - parameter s inferred to have type stringnames..forEach(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach(function (s) {  console.log(s.toUpperCase());}); // Contextual typing also applies to arrow functionsnames..forEach(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((s) => {  console.log(s.toUpperCase());});Try
```



Even though the parameter `s` didn’t have a type annotation, TypeScript used the types of the `forEach` function, along with the inferred type of the array, to determine the type `s` will have.

This process is called contextual typing because the context that the function occurred within informs what type it should have.

Similar to the inference rules, you don’t need to explicitly learn how this happens, but understanding that it does happen can help you notice when type annotations aren’t needed.
Later, we’ll see more examples of how the context that a value occurs in can affect its type.

## Object Types

Apart from primitives, the most common sort of type you’ll encounter is an object type .
This refers to any JavaScript value with properties, which is almost all of them!
To define an object type, we simply list its properties and their types.

For example, here’s a function that takes a point-like object:



```id
ts// The parameter&apos;s type annotation is an object typefunction printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s x value is " + pt.x);  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s y value is " + pt.y);}printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });Try
```



Here, we annotated the parameter with a type with two properties - `x` and `y` - which are both of type `number`.
You can use `,` or `;` to separate the properties, and the last separator is optional either way.

The type part of each property is also optional.
If you don’t specify a type, it will be assumed to be `any`.

### Optional Properties

Object types can also specify that some or all of their properties are optional .
To do this, add a `?` after the property name:



```id
tsfunction printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {  // ...}// Both OKprintName({ first: "Bob" });printName({ first: "Alice", last: "Alisson" });Try
```



In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn’t exist, you’ll get the value `undefined` rather than a runtime error.
Because of this, when you read from an optional property, you’ll have to check for `undefined` before using it.



```id
tsfunction printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {  // Error - might crash if &apos;obj.last&apos; wasn&apos;t provided!  console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());'obj.last' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'obj.last' is possibly 'undefined'.  if (obj.last !== undefined) {    // OK    console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());  }   // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax:  console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());}Try
```



## Union Types

TypeScript’s type system allows you to build new types out of existing ones using a large variety of operators.
Now that we know how to write a few types, it’s time to start combining them in interesting ways.

### Defining a Union Type

The first way to combine types you might see is a union type.
A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types.
We refer to each of these types as the union’s members .

Let’s write a function that can operate on strings or numbers:



```id
tsfunction printId(id: number | string) {  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);}// OKprintId(101);// OKprintId("202");// ErrorprintId({ myID: 22342 });Argument of type '{ myID: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.2345Argument of type '{ myID: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.Try
```


 

The separator of the union members is allowed before the first element, so you could also write this:



```id
tsfunction printTextOrNumberOrBool(  textOrNumberOrBool:    | string    | number    | boolean) {  console.log(textOrNumberOrBool);}Try
```


 

### Working with Union Types

It’s easy to provide a value matching a union type - simply provide a type matching any of the union’s members.
If you have a value of a union type, how do you work with it?

TypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for every member of the union.
For example, if you have the union `string | number`, you can’t use methods that are only available on `string`:



```id
tsfunction printId(id: number | string) {  console.log(id.toUpperCase());Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.2339Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.}Try
```



The solution is to narrow the union with code, the same as you would in JavaScript without type annotations.
 Narrowing occurs when TypeScript can deduce a more specific type for a value based on the structure of the code.

For example, TypeScript knows that only a `string` value will have a `typeof` value `"string"`:



```id
tsfunction printId(id: number | string) {  if (typeof id === "string") {    // In this branch, id is of type &apos;string&apos;    console.log(id.toUpperCase());  } else {    // Here, id is of type &apos;number&apos;    console.log(id);  }}Try
```



Another example is to use a function like `Array.isArray`:



```id
tsfunction welcomePeople(x: string[] | string) {  if (Array.isArray(x)) {    // Here: &apos;x&apos; is &apos;string[]&apos;    console.log("Hello, " + x..join(separator?: string): string' >join(" and "));  } else {    // Here: &apos;x&apos; is &apos;string&apos;    console.log("Welcome lone traveler " + x);  }}Try
```



Notice that in the `else` branch, we don’t need to do anything special - if `x` wasn’t a `string[]`, then it must have been a `string`.

Sometimes you’ll have a union where all the members have something in common.
For example, both arrays and strings have a `slice` method.
If every member in a union has a property in common, you can use that property without narrowing:



```id
ts// Return type is inferred as number[] | stringfunction getFirstThree(x: number[] | string) {  return x.slice(0, 3);}Try
```


 

It might be confusing that a union of types appears to have the intersection of those types’ properties.
This is not an accident - the name union comes from type theory.
The union `number | string` is composed by taking the union of the values from each type.
Notice that given two sets with corresponding facts about each set, only the intersection of those facts applies to the union of the sets themselves.
For example, if we had a room of tall people wearing hats, and another room of Spanish speakers wearing hats, after combining those rooms, the only thing we know about every person is that they must be wearing a hat.

 

## Type Aliases

We’ve been using object types and union types by writing them directly in type annotations.
This is convenient, but it’s common to want to use the same type more than once and refer to it by a single name.

A type alias is exactly that - a name for any type .
The syntax for a type alias is:



```id
tstype Point = {  x: number;  y: number;}; // Exactly the same as the earlier examplefunction printCoord(pt: Point) {  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s x value is " + pt.x);  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s y value is " + pt.y);} printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });Try
```



You can actually use a type alias to give a name to any type at all, not just an object type.
For example, a type alias can name a union type:



```id
tstype ID = number | string;Try
```



Note that aliases are only aliases - you cannot use type aliases to create different/distinct “versions” of the same type.
When you use the alias, it’s exactly as if you had written the aliased type.
In other words, this code might look illegal, but is OK according to TypeScript because both types are aliases for the same type:



```id
tstype UserInputSanitizedString = string; function sanitizeInput(str: string): UserInputSanitizedString {  return sanitize(str);} // Create a sanitized inputlet userInput = sanitizeInput(getInput()); // Can still be re-assigned with a string thoughuserInput = "new input";Try
```



## Interfaces

An interface declaration is another way to name an object type:



```id
tsinterface Point {  x: number;  y: number;} function printCoord(pt: Point) {  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s x value is " + pt.x);  console.log("The coordinate&apos;s y value is " + pt.y);} printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });Try
```



Just like when we used a type alias above, the example works just as if we had used an anonymous object type.
TypeScript is only concerned with the structure of the value we passed to `printCoord` - it only cares that it has the expected properties.
Being concerned only with the structure and capabilities of types is why we call TypeScript a structurally typed type system.

### Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces

Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely.
Almost all features of an `interface` are available in `type`, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

 
 
 
 
 `Interface` 
 `Type` 
 
 
 
 

Extending an interface


 `

```
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Bear extends Animal {
  honey: boolean;
}

const bear = getBear();
bear.name;
bear.honey;
```

`
 
 
 

Extending a type via intersections


 `

```
type Animal = {
  name: string;
}

type Bear = Animal & { 
  honey: boolean;
}

const bear = getBear();
bear.name;
bear.honey;
```

`
 
 
 
 
 

Adding new fields to an existing interface


 `

```
interface Window {
  title: string;
}

interface Window {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}

const src = 'const a = "Hello World"';
window.ts.transpileModule(src, {});
```

`
 
 
 

A type cannot be changed after being created


 `

```
type Window = {
  title: string;
}

type Window = {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}

 // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Window'.
```

You’ll learn more about these concepts in later chapters, so don’t worry if you don’t understand all of these right away.

- Prior to TypeScript version 4.2, type alias names may appear in error messages , sometimes in place of the equivalent anonymous type (which may or may not be desirable). Interfaces will always be named in error messages.

- Type aliases may not participate in declaration merging, but interfaces can .

- Interfaces may only be used to declare the shapes of objects, not rename primitives .

- Interface names will always appear in their original form in error messages, but only when they are used by name.

- Using interfaces with `extends` can often be more performant for the compiler than type aliases with intersections

For the most part, you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will tell you if it needs something to be the other kind of declaration. If you would like a heuristic, use `interface` until you need to use features from `type`.

## Type Assertions

Sometimes you will have information about the type of a value that TypeScript can’t know about.

For example, if you’re using `document.getElementById`, TypeScript only knows that this will return some kind of `HTMLElement`, but you might know that your page will always have an `HTMLCanvasElement` with a given ID.

In this situation, you can use a type assertion to specify a more specific type:



```id
tsconst myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;Try
```



Like a type annotation, type assertions are removed by the compiler and won’t affect the runtime behavior of your code.

You can also use the angle-bracket syntax (except if the code is in a `.tsx` file), which is equivalent:



```id
tsconst myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");Try
```


 

Reminder: Because type assertions are removed at compile-time, there is no runtime checking associated with a type assertion.
There won’t be an exception or `null` generated if the type assertion is wrong.

 

TypeScript only allows type assertions which convert to a more specific or less specific version of a type.
This rule prevents “impossible” coercions like:



```id
tsconst x = "hello" as number;Conversion of type 'string' to type 'number' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.2352Conversion of type 'string' to type 'number' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.Try
```



Sometimes this rule can be too conservative and will disallow more complex coercions that might be valid.
If this happens, you can use two assertions, first to `any` (or `unknown`, which we’ll introduce later), then to the desired type:



```id
tsconst a = expr as any as T;Try
```



## Literal Types

In addition to the general types `string` and `number`, we can refer to specific strings and numbers in type positions.

One way to think about this is to consider how JavaScript comes with different ways to declare a variable. Both `var` and `let` allow for changing what is held inside the variable, and `const` does not. This is reflected in how TypeScript creates types for literals.



```id
tslet changingString = "Hello World";changingString = "Olá Mundo";// Because `changingString` can represent any possible string, that// is how TypeScript describes it in the type systemchangingString;      let changingString: string const constantString = "Hello World";// Because `constantString` can only represent 1 possible string, it// has a literal type representationconstantString;      const constantString: "Hello World"Try
```



By themselves, literal types aren’t very valuable:



```id
tslet x: "hello" = "hello";// OKx = "hello";// ...x = "howdy";Type '"howdy"' is not assignable to type '"hello"'.2322Type '"howdy"' is not assignable to type '"hello"'.Try
```



It’s not much use to have a variable that can only have one value!

But by combining literals into unions, you can express a much more useful concept - for example, functions that only accept a certain set of known values:



```id
tsfunction printText(s: string, alignment: "left" | "right" | "center") {  // ...}printText("Hello, world", "left");printText("G&apos;day, mate", "centre");Argument of type '"centre"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right" | "center"'.2345Argument of type '"centre"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right" | "center"'.Try
```



Numeric literal types work the same way:



```id
tsfunction compare(a: string, b: string): -1 | 0 | 1 {  return a === b ? 0 : a > b ? 1 : -1;}Try
```



Of course, you can combine these with non-literal types:



```id
tsinterface Options {  width: number;}function configure(x: Options | "auto") {  // ...}configure({ width: 100 });configure("auto");configure("automatic");Argument of type '"automatic"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Options | "auto"'.2345Argument of type '"automatic"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Options | "auto"'.Try
```



There’s one more kind of literal type: boolean literals.
There are only two boolean literal types, and as you might guess, they are the types `true` and `false`.
The type `boolean` itself is actually just an alias for the union `true | false`.

### Literal Inference

When you initialize a variable with an object, TypeScript assumes that the properties of that object might change values later.
For example, if you wrote code like this:



```id
tsconst obj = { counter: 0 };if (someCondition) {  obj.counter = 1;}Try
```



TypeScript doesn’t assume the assignment of `1` to a field which previously had `0` is an error.
Another way of saying this is that `obj.counter` must have the type `number`, not `0`, because types are used to determine both reading and writing behavior.

The same applies to strings:



```id
tsdeclare function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void; const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" };handleRequest(req.url, req.method);Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"GET" | "POST"'.2345Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"GET" | "POST"'.Try
```



In the above example `req.method` is inferred to be `string`, not `"GET"`. Because code can be evaluated between the creation of `req` and the call of `handleRequest` which could assign a new string like `"GUESS"` to `req.method`, TypeScript considers this code to have an error.

There are two ways to work around this.

- 

You can change the inference by adding a type assertion in either location:



```id
ts// Change 1:const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" as "GET" };// Change 2handleRequest(req.url, req.method as "GET");Try
```



Change 1 means “I intend for `req.method` to always have the literal type `"GET"`”, preventing the possible assignment of `"GUESS"` to that field after.
Change 2 means “I know for other reasons that `req.method` has the value `"GET"`“.

- 

You can use `as const` to convert the entire object to be type literals:



```id
tsconst req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" } as const;handleRequest(req.url, req.method);Try
```



The `as const` suffix acts like `const` but for the type system, ensuring that all properties are assigned the literal type instead of a more general version like `string` or `number`.

## `null` and `undefined`

JavaScript has two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value: `null` and `undefined`.

TypeScript has two corresponding types by the same names. How these types behave depends on whether you have the `strictNullChecks` option on.

### `strictNullChecks` off

With `strictNullChecks` off , values that might be `null` or `undefined` can still be accessed normally, and the values `null` and `undefined` can be assigned to a property of any type.
This is similar to how languages without null checks (e.g. C#, Java) behave.
The lack of checking for these values tends to be a major source of bugs; we always recommend people turn `strictNullChecks` on if it’s practical to do so in their codebase.

### `strictNullChecks` on

With `strictNullChecks` on , when a value is `null` or `undefined`, you will need to test for those values before using methods or properties on that value.
Just like checking for `undefined` before using an optional property, we can use narrowing to check for values that might be `null`:



```id
tsfunction doSomething(x: string | null) {  if (x === null) {    // do nothing  } else {    console.log("Hello, " + x.toUpperCase());  }}Try
```



### Non-null Assertion Operator (Postfix `!`)

TypeScript also has a special syntax for removing `null` and `undefined` from a type without doing any explicit checking.
Writing `!` after any expression is effectively a type assertion that the value isn’t `null` or `undefined`:



```id
tsfunction liveDangerously(x?: number | null) {  // No error  console.log(x!.toFixed());}Try
```



Just like other type assertions, this doesn’t change the runtime behavior of your code, so it’s important to only use `!` when you know that the value can’t be `null` or `undefined`.

## Enums

Enums are a feature added to JavaScript by TypeScript which allows for describing a value which could be one of a set of possible named constants. Unlike most TypeScript features, this is not a type-level addition to JavaScript but something added to the language and runtime. Because of this, it’s a feature which you should know exists, but maybe hold off on using unless you are sure. You can read more about enums in the Enum reference page .

## Less Common Primitives

It’s worth mentioning the rest of the primitives in JavaScript which are represented in the type system.
Though we will not go into depth here.

#### `bigint`

From ES2020 onwards, there is a primitive in JavaScript used for very large integers, `BigInt`:



```id
ts// Creating a bigint via the BigInt functionconst oneHundred: bigint =  bigint' >BigInt(100); // Creating a BigInt via the literal syntaxconst anotherHundred: bigint = 100n;Try
```



You can learn more about BigInt in the TypeScript 3.2 release notes .

#### `symbol`

There is a primitive in JavaScript used to create a globally unique reference via the function `Symbol()`:



```id
tsconst firstName =  symbol' >Symbol("name");const secondName =  symbol' >Symbol("name"); if (firstName === secondName) {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof firstName' and 'typeof secondName' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof firstName' and 'typeof secondName' have no overlap.  // Can&apos;t ever happen}Try
```



You can learn more about them in Symbols reference page .

# Typeof Type Operator

 

## The `typeof` type operator

JavaScript already has a `typeof` operator you can use in an expression context:



```id
ts// Prints "string"console.log(typeof "Hello world");Try
```



TypeScript adds a `typeof` operator you can use in a type context to refer to the type of a variable or property:



```id
tslet s = "hello";let n: typeof s;   let n: stringTry
```



This isn’t very useful for basic types, but combined with other type operators, you can use `typeof` to conveniently express many patterns.
For an example, let’s start by looking at the predefined type `ReturnType `.
It takes a function type and produces its return type:



```id
tstype  boolean' >Predicate = (x: unknown) => boolean;type K =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType< boolean' >Predicate>;    type K = booleanTry
```



If we try to use `ReturnType` on a function name, we see an instructive error:



```id
tsfunction f() {  return { x: 10, y: 3 };}type P =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<f>;'f' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof f'?2749'f' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof f'?Try
```



Remember that values and types aren’t the same thing.
To refer to the type that the value `f` has, we use `typeof`:



```id
tsfunction f() {  return { x: 10, y: 3 };}type P =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<typeof f>;    type P = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}Try
```



### Limitations

TypeScript intentionally limits the sorts of expressions you can use `typeof` on.

Specifically, it’s only legal to use `typeof` on identifiers (i.e. variable names) or their properties.
This helps avoid the confusing trap of writing code you think is executing, but isn’t:



```id
ts// Meant to use = ReturnType<typeof msgbox>let  boolean' >shouldContinue: typeof  boolean' >msgbox("Are you sure you want to continue?");',' expected.1005',' expected.Try
```

# Indexed Access Types

 

We can use an indexed access type to look up a specific property on another type:



```id
tstype Person = { age: number; name: string; alive: boolean };type Age = Person["age"];     type Age = numberTry
```



The indexing type is itself a type, so we can use unions, `keyof`, or other types entirely:



```id
tstype I1 = Person["age" | "name"];     type I1 = string | number type I2 = Person[keyof Person];     type I2 = string | number | boolean type AliveOrName = "alive" | "name";type I3 = Person[AliveOrName];     type I3 = string | booleanTry
```



You’ll even see an error if you try to index a property that doesn’t exist:



```id
tstype I1 = Person["alve"];Property 'alve' does not exist on type 'Person'.2339Property 'alve' does not exist on type 'Person'.Try
```



Another example of indexing with an arbitrary type is using `number` to get the type of an array’s elements.
We can combine this with `typeof` to conveniently capture the element type of an array literal:



```id
tsconst MyArray = [  { name: "Alice", age: 15 },  { name: "Bob", age: 23 },  { name: "Eve", age: 38 },]; type Person = typeof MyArray[number];       type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}type Age = typeof MyArray[number]["age"];     type Age = number// Ortype Age2 = Person["age"];      type Age2 = numberTry
```



You can only use types when indexing, meaning you can’t use a `const` to make a variable reference:



```id
tsconst key = "age";type Age = Person[key];Type 'key' cannot be used as an index type.'key' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof key'?2538
2749Type 'key' cannot be used as an index type.'key' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof key'?Try
```



However, you can use a type alias for a similar style of refactor:



```id
tstype key = "age";type Age = Person[key];Try
```

### TypeScript: Documentation - Narrowing

# Narrowing

 

Imagine we have a function called `padLeft`.



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {  throw new  Error' >Error("Not implemented yet!");}Try
```



If `padding` is a `number`, it will treat that as the number of spaces we want to prepend to `input`.
If `padding` is a `string`, it should just prepend `padding` to `input`.
Let’s try to implement the logic for when `padLeft` is passed a `number` for `padding`.



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {  return " ".repeat(padding) + input;Argument of type 'string | number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
  Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2345Argument of type 'string | number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
  Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.}Try
```



Uh-oh, we’re getting an error on `padding`.
TypeScript is warning us that we’re passing a value with type `number | string` to the `repeat` function, which only accepts a `number`, and it’s right.
In other words, we haven’t explicitly checked if `padding` is a `number` first, nor are we handling the case where it’s a `string`, so let’s do exactly that.



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {  if (typeof padding === "number") {    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;  }  return padding + input;}Try
```



If this mostly looks like uninteresting JavaScript code, that’s sort of the point.
Apart from the annotations we put in place, this TypeScript code looks like JavaScript.
The idea is that TypeScript’s type system aims to make it as easy as possible to write typical JavaScript code without bending over backwards to get type safety.

While it might not look like much, there’s actually a lot going on under the covers here.
Much like how TypeScript analyzes runtime values using static types, it overlays type analysis on JavaScript’s runtime control flow constructs like `if/else`, conditional ternaries, loops, truthiness checks, etc., which can all affect those types.

Within our `if` check, TypeScript sees `typeof padding === "number"` and understands that as a special form of code called a type guard .
TypeScript follows possible paths of execution that our programs can take to analyze the most specific possible type of a value at a given position.
It looks at these special checks (called type guards ) and assignments, and the process of refining types to more specific types than declared is called narrowing .
In many editors we can observe these types as they change, and we’ll even do so in our examples.



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {  if (typeof padding === "number") {    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;                        (parameter) padding: number  }  return padding + input;           (parameter) padding: string}Try
```



There are a couple of different constructs TypeScript understands for narrowing.

## `typeof` type guards

As we’ve seen, JavaScript supports a `typeof` operator which can give very basic information about the type of values we have at runtime.
TypeScript expects this to return a certain set of strings:

 `"string"`

- `"number"`

- `"bigint"`

- `"boolean"`

- `"symbol"`

- `"undefined"`

- `"object"`

- `"function"`

Like we saw with `padLeft`, this operator comes up pretty often in a number of JavaScript libraries, and TypeScript can understand it to narrow types in different branches.

In TypeScript, checking against the value returned by `typeof` is a type guard.
Because TypeScript encodes how `typeof` operates on different values, it knows about some of its quirks in JavaScript.
For example, notice that in the list above, `typeof` doesn’t return the string `null`.
Check out the following example:



```id
tsfunction printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {  if (typeof strs === "object") {    for (const s of strs) {'strs' is possibly 'null'.18047'strs' is possibly 'null'.      console.log(s);    }  } else if (typeof strs === "string") {    console.log(strs);  } else {    // do nothing  }}Try
```



In the `printAll` function, we try to check if `strs` is an object to see if it’s an array type (now might be a good time to reinforce that arrays are object types in JavaScript).
But it turns out that in JavaScript, `typeof null` is actually `"object"`!
This is one of those unfortunate accidents of history.

Users with enough experience might not be surprised, but not everyone has run into this in JavaScript; luckily, TypeScript lets us know that `strs` was only narrowed down to `string[] | null` instead of just `string[]`.

This might be a good segue into what we’ll call “truthiness” checking.

# Truthiness narrowing

Truthiness might not be a word you’ll find in the dictionary, but it’s very much something you’ll hear about in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, we can use any expression in conditionals, `&&`s, `||`s, `if` statements, Boolean negations (`!`), and more.
As an example, `if` statements don’t expect their condition to always have the type `boolean`.



```id
tsfunction getUsersOnlineMessage(numUsersOnline: number) {  if (numUsersOnline) {    return `There are ${numUsersOnline} online now!`;  }  return "Nobody&apos;s here. :(";}Try
```



In JavaScript, constructs like `if` first “coerce” their conditions to `boolean`s to make sense of them, and then choose their branches depending on whether the result is `true` or `false`.
Values like

- `0`

- `NaN`

- `""` (the empty string)

- `0n` (the `bigint` version of zero)

- `null`

- `undefined`

all coerce to `false`, and other values get coerced to `true`.
You can always coerce values to `boolean`s by running them through the `Boolean` function, or by using the shorter double-Boolean negation. (The latter has the advantage that TypeScript infers a narrow literal boolean type `true`, while inferring the first as type `boolean`.)



```id
ts// both of these result in &apos;true&apos;(value?: string | undefined) => boolean' >Boolean("hello"); // type: boolean, value: true!!"world"; // type: true,    value: trueThis kind of expression is always truthy.2872This kind of expression is always truthy.Try
```



It’s fairly popular to leverage this behavior, especially for guarding against values like `null` or `undefined`.
As an example, let’s try using it for our `printAll` function.



```id
tsfunction printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {  if (strs && typeof strs === "object") {    for (const s of strs) {      console.log(s);    }  } else if (typeof strs === "string") {    console.log(strs);  }}Try
```



You’ll notice that we’ve gotten rid of the error above by checking if `strs` is truthy.
This at least prevents us from dreaded errors when we run our code like:



```id
txtTypeError: null is not iterable
```



Keep in mind though that truthiness checking on primitives can often be error prone.
As an example, consider a different attempt at writing `printAll`



```id
tsfunction printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {  // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  //  DON&apos;T DO THIS!  //   KEEP READING  // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  if (strs) {    if (typeof strs === "object") {      for (const s of strs) {        console.log(s);      }    } else if (typeof strs === "string") {      console.log(strs);    }  }}Try
```



We wrapped the entire body of the function in a truthy check, but this has a subtle downside: we may no longer be handling the empty string case correctly.

TypeScript doesn’t hurt us here at all, but this behavior is worth noting if you’re less familiar with JavaScript.
TypeScript can often help you catch bugs early on, but if you choose to do nothing with a value, there’s only so much that it can do without being overly prescriptive.
If you want, you can make sure you handle situations like these with a linter.

One last word on narrowing by truthiness is that Boolean negations with `!` filter out from negated branches.



```id
tsfunction multiplyAll(  values: number[] | undefined,  factor: number): number[] | undefined {  if (!values) {    return values;  } else {    return values..map<number>(callbackfn: (value: number, index: number, array: number[]) => number, thisArg?: any): number[]' >map((x) => x * factor);  }}Try
```



## Equality narrowing

TypeScript also uses `switch` statements and equality checks like `===`, `!==`, `==`, and `!=` to narrow types.
For example:



```id
tsfunction example(x: string | number, y: string | boolean) {  if (x === y) {    // We can now call any &apos;string&apos; method on &apos;x&apos; or &apos;y&apos;.    x.toUpperCase();          (method) String.toUpperCase(): string    y.toLowerCase();          (method) String.toLowerCase(): string  } else {    console.log(x);               (parameter) x: string | number    console.log(y);               (parameter) y: string | boolean  }}Try
```



When we checked that `x` and `y` are both equal in the above example, TypeScript knew their types also had to be equal.
Since `string` is the only common type that both `x` and `y` could take on, TypeScript knows that `x` and `y` must be `string`s in the first branch.

Checking against specific literal values (as opposed to variables) works also.
In our section about truthiness narrowing, we wrote a `printAll` function which was error-prone because it accidentally didn’t handle empty strings properly.
Instead we could have done a specific check to block out `null`s, and TypeScript still correctly removes `null` from the type of `strs`.



```id
tsfunction printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {  if (strs !== null) {    if (typeof strs === "object") {      for (const s of strs) {                       (parameter) strs: string[]        console.log(s);      }    } else if (typeof strs === "string") {      console.log(strs);                   (parameter) strs: string    }  }}Try
```



JavaScript’s looser equality checks with `==` and `!=` also get narrowed correctly.
If you’re unfamiliar, checking whether something `== null` actually not only checks whether it is specifically the value `null` - it also checks whether it’s potentially `undefined`.
The same applies to `== undefined`: it checks whether a value is either `null` or `undefined`.



```id
tsinterface Container {  value: number | null | undefined;} function multiplyValue(container: Container, factor: number) {  // Remove both &apos;null&apos; and &apos;undefined&apos; from the type.  if (container.value != null) {    console.log(container.value);                           (property) Container.value: number     // Now we can safely multiply &apos;container.value&apos;.    container.value *= factor;  }}Try
```



## The `in` operator narrowing

JavaScript has an operator for determining if an object or its prototype chain has a property with a name: the `in` operator.
TypeScript takes this into account as a way to narrow down potential types.

For example, with the code: `"value" in x`. where `"value"` is a string literal and `x` is a union type.
The “true” branch narrows `x`’s types which have either an optional or required property `value`, and the “false” branch narrows to types which have an optional or missing property `value`.



```id
tstype  void;
}' >Fish = {  void' >swim: () => void };type  void;
}' >Bird = {  void' >fly: () => void }; function move(animal:  void;
}' >Fish |  void;
}' >Bird) {  if ("swim" in animal) {    return animal. void' >swim();  }   return animal. void' >fly();}Try
```



To reiterate, optional properties will exist in both sides for narrowing. For example, a human could both swim and fly (with the right equipment) and thus should show up in both sides of the `in` check:

 


```id
tstype  void;
}' >Fish = {  void' >swim: () => void };type  void;
}' >Bird = {  void' >fly: () => void };type  void;
    fly?: () => void;
}' >Human = {  void) | undefined' >swim?: () => void;  void) | undefined' >fly?: () => void }; function move(animal:  void;
}' >Fish |  void;
}' >Bird |  void;
    fly?: () => void;
}' >Human) {  if ("swim" in animal) {    animal;      (parameter) animal: Fish | Human  } else {    animal;      (parameter) animal: Bird | Human  }}Try
```



## `instanceof` narrowing

JavaScript has an operator for checking whether or not a value is an “instance” of another value.
More specifically, in JavaScript `x instanceof Foo` checks whether the prototype chain of `x` contains `Foo.prototype`.
While we won’t dive deep here, and you’ll see more of this when we get into classes, they can still be useful for most values that can be constructed with `new`.
As you might have guessed, `instanceof` is also a type guard, and TypeScript narrows in branches guarded by `instanceof`s.



```id
tsfunction logValue(x: Date | string) {  if (x instanceof Date) {    console.log(x.toUTCString());               (parameter) x: Date  } else {    console.log(x.toUpperCase());               (parameter) x: string  }}Try
```



## Assignments

As we mentioned earlier, when we assign to any variable, TypeScript looks at the right side of the assignment and narrows the left side appropriately.



```id
tslet x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 10 : "hello world!";   let x: string | numberx = 1; console.log(x);           let x: numberx = "goodbye!"; console.log(x);           let x: stringTry
```



Notice that each of these assignments is valid.
Even though the observed type of `x` changed to `number` after our first assignment, we were still able to assign a `string` to `x`.
This is because the declared type of `x` - the type that `x` started with - is `string | number`, and assignability is always checked against the declared type.

If we’d assigned a `boolean` to `x`, we’d have seen an error since that wasn’t part of the declared type.



```id
tslet x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 10 : "hello world!";   let x: string | numberx = 1; console.log(x);           let x: numberx = true;Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.2322Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'. console.log(x);           let x: string | numberTry
```



## Control flow analysis

Up until this point, we’ve gone through some basic examples of how TypeScript narrows within specific branches.
But there’s a bit more going on than just walking up from every variable and looking for type guards in `if`s, `while`s, conditionals, etc.
For example



```id
tsfunction padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {  if (typeof padding === "number") {    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;  }  return padding + input;}Try
```



`padLeft` returns from within its first `if` block.
TypeScript was able to analyze this code and see that the rest of the body (`return padding + input;`) is unreachable in the case where `padding` is a `number`.
As a result, it was able to remove `number` from the type of `padding` (narrowing from `string | number` to `string`) for the rest of the function.

This analysis of code based on reachability is called control flow analysis , and TypeScript uses this flow analysis to narrow types as it encounters type guards and assignments.
When a variable is analyzed, control flow can split off and re-merge over and over again, and that variable can be observed to have a different type at each point.



```id
tsfunction example() {  let x: string | number | boolean;   x = Math.random() < 0.5;   console.log(x);             let x: boolean   if (Math.random() < 0.5) {    x = "hello";    console.log(x);               let x: string  } else {    x = 100;    console.log(x);               let x: number  }   return x;        let x: string | number}Try
```



## Using type predicates

We’ve worked with existing JavaScript constructs to handle narrowing so far, however sometimes you want more direct control over how types change throughout your code.

To define a user-defined type guard, we simply need to define a function whose return type is a type predicate :



```id
tsfunction isFish(pet:  void;
}' >Fish |  void;
}' >Bird): pet is  void;
}' >Fish {  return (pet as  void;
}' >Fish). void' >swim !== undefined;}Try
```



`pet is Fish` is our type predicate in this example.
A predicate takes the form `parameterName is Type`, where `parameterName` must be the name of a parameter from the current function signature.

Any time `isFish` is called with some variable, TypeScript will narrow that variable to that specific type if the original type is compatible.



```id
ts// Both calls to &apos;swim&apos; and &apos;fly&apos; are now okay.let pet = getSmallPet(); if (isFish(pet)) {  pet. void' >swim();} else {  pet. void' >fly();}Try
```



Notice that TypeScript not only knows that `pet` is a `Fish` in the `if` branch;
it also knows that in the `else` branch, you don’t have a `Fish`, so you must have a `Bird`.

You may use the type guard `isFish` to filter an array of `Fish | Bird` and obtain an array of `Fish`:



```id
tsconst zoo: ( void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish |  void;
    name: string;
}' >Bird)[] = [getSmallPet(), getSmallPet(), getSmallPet()];const underWater1:  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish[] = zoo..filter<Fish>(predicate: (value: Fish | Bird, index: number, array: (Fish | Bird)[]) => value is Fish, thisArg?: any): Fish[] (+1 overload)' >filter(isFish);// or, equivalentlyconst underWater2:  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish[] = zoo..filter<Fish>(predicate: (value: Fish | Bird, index: number, array: (Fish | Bird)[]) => value is Fish, thisArg?: any): Fish[] (+1 overload)' >filter(isFish) as  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish[]; // The predicate may need repeating for more complex examplesconst underWater3:  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish[] = zoo..filter<Fish>(predicate: (value: Fish | Bird, index: number, array: (Fish | Bird)[]) => value is Fish, thisArg?: any): Fish[] (+1 overload)' >filter((pet): pet is  void;
    name: string;
}' >Fish => {  if (pet.name === "sharkey") return false;  return isFish(pet);});Try
```



In addition, classes can use `this is Type` to narrow their type.

## Assertion functions

Types can also be narrowed using Assertion functions .

# Discriminated unions

Most of the examples we’ve looked at so far have focused around narrowing single variables with simple types like `string`, `boolean`, and `number`.
While this is common, most of the time in JavaScript we’ll be dealing with slightly more complex structures.

For some motivation, let’s imagine we’re trying to encode shapes like circles and squares.
Circles keep track of their radiuses and squares keep track of their side lengths.
We’ll use a field called `kind` to tell which shape we’re dealing with.
Here’s a first attempt at defining `Shape`.



```id
tsinterface Shape {  kind: "circle" | "square";  radius?: number;  sideLength?: number;}Try
```



Notice we’re using a union of string literal types: `"circle"` and `"square"` to tell us whether we should treat the shape as a circle or square respectively.
By using `"circle" | "square"` instead of `string`, we can avoid misspelling issues.



```id
tsfunction handleShape(shape: Shape) {  // oops!  if (shape.kind === "rect") {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"circle" | "square"' and '"rect"' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types '"circle" | "square"' and '"rect"' have no overlap.    // ...  }}Try
```



We can write a `getArea` function that applies the right logic based on if it’s dealing with a circle or square.
We’ll first try dealing with circles.



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.}Try
```


 

Under `strictNullChecks` that gives us an error - which is appropriate since `radius` might not be defined.
But what if we perform the appropriate checks on the `kind` property?



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  if (shape.kind === "circle") {    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.  }}Try
```



Hmm, TypeScript still doesn’t know what to do here.
We’ve hit a point where we know more about our values than the type checker does.
We could try to use a non-null assertion (a `!` after `shape.radius`) to say that `radius` is definitely present.



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  if (shape.kind === "circle") {    return Math.PI * shape.radius! ** 2;  }}Try
```



But this doesn’t feel ideal.
We had to shout a bit at the type-checker with those non-null assertions (`!`) to convince it that `shape.radius` was defined, but those assertions are error-prone if we start to move code around.
Additionally, outside of `strictNullChecks` we’re able to accidentally access any of those fields anyway (since optional properties are just assumed to always be present when reading them).
We can definitely do better.

The problem with this encoding of `Shape` is that the type-checker doesn’t have any way to know whether or not `radius` or `sideLength` are present based on the `kind` property.
We need to communicate what we know to the type checker.
With that in mind, let’s take another swing at defining `Shape`.



```id
tsinterface Circle {  kind: "circle";  radius: number;} interface Square {  kind: "square";  sideLength: number;} type Shape = Circle | Square;Try
```



Here, we’ve properly separated `Shape` out into two types with different values for the `kind` property, but `radius` and `sideLength` are declared as required properties in their respective types.

Let’s see what happens here when we try to access the `radius` of a `Shape`.



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Shape'.
  Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Square'.2339Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Shape'.
  Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Square'.}Try
```



Like with our first definition of `Shape`, this is still an error.
When `radius` was optional, we got an error (with `strictNullChecks` enabled) because TypeScript couldn’t tell whether the property was present.
Now that `Shape` is a union, TypeScript is telling us that `shape` might be a `Square`, and `Square`s don’t have `radius` defined on them!
Both interpretations are correct, but only the union encoding of `Shape` will cause an error regardless of how `strictNullChecks` is configured.

But what if we tried checking the `kind` property again?



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  if (shape.kind === "circle") {    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;                      (parameter) shape: Circle  }}Try
```



That got rid of the error!
When every type in a union contains a common property with literal types, TypeScript considers that to be a discriminated union , and can narrow out the members of the union.

In this case, `kind` was that common property (which is what’s considered a discriminant property of `Shape`).
Checking whether the `kind` property was `"circle"` got rid of every type in `Shape` that didn’t have a `kind` property with the type `"circle"`.
That narrowed `shape` down to the type `Circle`.

The same checking works with `switch` statements as well.
Now we can try to write our complete `getArea` without any pesky `!` non-null assertions.



```id
tsfunction getArea(shape: Shape) {  switch (shape.kind) {    case "circle":      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;                        (parameter) shape: Circle    case "square":      return shape.sideLength ** 2;              (parameter) shape: Square  }}Try
```



The important thing here was the encoding of `Shape`.
Communicating the right information to TypeScript - that `Circle` and `Square` were really two separate types with specific `kind` fields - was crucial.
Doing that lets us write type-safe TypeScript code that looks no different than the JavaScript we would’ve written otherwise.
From there, the type system was able to do the “right” thing and figure out the types in each branch of our `switch` statement.

 

As an aside, try playing around with the above example and remove some of the return keywords.
You’ll see that type-checking can help avoid bugs when accidentally falling through different clauses in a `switch` statement.

 

Discriminated unions are useful for more than just talking about circles and squares.
They’re good for representing any sort of messaging scheme in JavaScript, like when sending messages over the network (client/server communication), or encoding mutations in a state management framework.

# The `never` type

When narrowing, you can reduce the options of a union to a point where you have removed all possibilities and have nothing left.
In those cases, TypeScript will use a `never` type to represent a state which shouldn’t exist.

# Exhaustiveness checking

The `never` type is assignable to every type; however, no type is assignable to `never` (except `never` itself). This means you can use narrowing and rely on `never` turning up to do exhaustive checking in a `switch` statement.

For example, adding a `default` to our `getArea` function which tries to assign the shape to `never` will not raise an error when every possible case has been handled.



```id
tstype Shape = Circle | Square; function getArea(shape: Shape) {  switch (shape.kind) {    case "circle":      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;    case "square":      return shape.sideLength ** 2;    default:      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;      return _exhaustiveCheck;  }}Try
```



Adding a new member to the `Shape` union, will cause a TypeScript error:



```id
tsinterface Triangle {  kind: "triangle";  sideLength: number;} type Shape = Circle | Square | Triangle; function getArea(shape: Shape) {  switch (shape.kind) {    case "circle":      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;    case "square":      return shape.sideLength ** 2;    default:      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;Type 'Triangle' is not assignable to type 'never'.2322Type 'Triangle' is not assignable to type 'never'.      return _exhaustiveCheck;  }}Try
```

### TypeScript: Documentation - Conditional Types

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - Conditional Types

# Conditional Types

 

At the heart of most useful programs, we have to make decisions based on input.
JavaScript programs are no different, but given the fact that values can be easily introspected, those decisions are also based on the types of the inputs.
 Conditional types help describe the relation between the types of inputs and outputs.



```id
tsinterface Animal {  live(): void;}interface Dog extends Animal {  woof(): void;} type Example1 = Dog extends Animal ? number : string;        type Example1 = number type Example2 = RegExp extends Animal ? number : string;        type Example2 = stringTry
```



Conditional types take a form that looks a little like conditional expressions (`condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression`) in JavaScript:



```id
ts  SomeType extends OtherType ? TrueType : FalseType;Try
```



When the type on the left of the `extends` is assignable to the one on the right, then you’ll get the type in the first branch (the “true” branch); otherwise you’ll get the type in the latter branch (the “false” branch).

From the examples above, conditional types might not immediately seem useful - we can tell ourselves whether or not `Dog extends Animal` and pick `number` or `string`!
But the power of conditional types comes from using them with generics.

For example, let’s take the following `createLabel` function:



```id
tsinterface IdLabel {  id: number /* some fields */;}interface NameLabel {  name: string /* other fields */;} function createLabel(id: number): IdLabel;function createLabel(name: string): NameLabel;function createLabel(nameOrId: string | number): IdLabel | NameLabel;function createLabel(nameOrId: string | number): IdLabel | NameLabel {  throw "unimplemented";}Try
```



These overloads for createLabel describe a single JavaScript function that makes a choice based on the types of its inputs. Note a few things:

 If a library has to make the same sort of choice over and over throughout its API, this becomes cumbersome.

- We have to create three overloads: one for each case when we’re sure of the type (one for `string` and one for `number`), and one for the most general case (taking a `string | number`). For every new type `createLabel` can handle, the number of overloads grows exponentially.

Instead, we can encode that logic in a conditional type:



```id
tstype  = T extends number ? IdLabel : NameLabel' >NameOrId<' >T extends number | string> = ' >T extends number  ? IdLabel  : NameLabel;Try
```



We can then use that conditional type to simplify our overloads down to a single function with no overloads.



```id
tsfunction (idOrName: T): NameOrId<T>' >createLabel<(idOrName: T): NameOrId<T>' >T extends number | string>(idOrName: (idOrName: T): NameOrId<T>' >T):  = T extends number ? IdLabel : NameLabel' >NameOrId<(idOrName: T): NameOrId<T>' >T> {  throw "unimplemented";} let a = (idOrName: "typescript"): NameLabel' >createLabel("typescript");   let a: NameLabel let b = (idOrName: 2.8): IdLabel' >createLabel(2.8);   let b: IdLabel let c = (idOrName: "hello" | 42): IdLabel | NameLabel' >createLabel(Math.random() ? "hello" : 42);let c: NameLabel | IdLabelTry
```



### Conditional Type Constraints

Often, the checks in a conditional type will provide us with some new information.
Just like narrowing with type guards can give us a more specific type, the true branch of a conditional type will further constrain generics by the type we check against.

For example, let’s take the following:



```id
tstype  = T["message"]' >MessageOf<' >T> = ' >T["message"];Type '"message"' cannot be used to index type 'T'.2536Type '"message"' cannot be used to index type 'T'.Try
```



In this example, TypeScript errors because `T` isn’t known to have a property called `message`.
We could constrain `T`, and TypeScript would no longer complain:



```id
tstype  = T["message"]' >MessageOf<' >T extends { message: unknown }> = ' >T["message"]; interface Email {  message: string;} type EmailMessageContents =  = T["message"]' >MessageOf<Email>;              type EmailMessageContents = stringTry
```



However, what if we wanted `MessageOf` to take any type, and default to something like `never` if a `message` property isn’t available?
We can do this by moving the constraint out and introducing a conditional type:



```id
tstype  = T extends {
    message: unknown;
} ? T["message"] : never' >MessageOf<' >T> = ' >T extends { message: unknown } ? ' >T["message"] : never; interface Email {  message: string;} interface Dog {  bark(): void;} type EmailMessageContents =  = T extends {
    message: unknown;
} ? T["message"] : never' >MessageOf<Email>;              type EmailMessageContents = string type DogMessageContents =  = T extends {
    message: unknown;
} ? T["message"] : never' >MessageOf<Dog>;             type DogMessageContents = neverTry
```



Within the true branch, TypeScript knows that `T` will have a `message` property.

As another example, we could also write a type called `Flatten` that flattens array types to their element types, but leaves them alone otherwise:



```id
tstype  = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T' >Flatten<' >T> = ' >T extends any[] ? ' >T[number] : ' >T; // Extracts out the element type.type Str =  = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T' >Flatten<string[]>;     type Str = string // Leaves the type alone.type Num =  = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T' >Flatten<number>;     type Num = numberTry
```



When `Flatten` is given an array type, it uses an indexed access with `number` to fetch out `string[]`’s element type.
Otherwise, it just returns the type it was given.

### Inferring Within Conditional Types

We just found ourselves using conditional types to apply constraints and then extract out types.
This ends up being such a common operation that conditional types make it easier.

Conditional types provide us with a way to infer from types we compare against in the true branch using the `infer` keyword.
For example, we could have inferred the element type in `Flatten` instead of fetching it out “manually” with an indexed access type:



```id
tstype  = Type extends (infer Item)[] ? Item : Type' >Flatten<' >Type> = ' >Type extends ' >Array<infer Item> ? Item : ' >Type;Try
```



Here, we used the `infer` keyword to declaratively introduce a new generic type variable named `Item` instead of specifying how to retrieve the element type of `Type` within the true branch.
This frees us from having to think about how to dig through and probing apart the structure of the types we’re interested in.

We can write some useful helper type aliases using the `infer` keyword.
For example, for simple cases, we can extract the return type out from function types:



```id
tstype  = Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return ? Return : never' >GetReturnType<' >Type> = ' >Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return  ? Return  : never; type Num =  = Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return ? Return : never' >GetReturnType<() => number>;     type Num = number type Str =  = Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return ? Return : never' >GetReturnType<(x: string) => string>;     type Str = string type Bools =  = Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return ? Return : never' >GetReturnType<(a: boolean, b: boolean) => boolean[]>;      type Bools = boolean[]Try
```



When inferring from a type with multiple call signatures (such as the type of an overloaded function), inferences are made from the last signature (which, presumably, is the most permissive catch-all case). It is not possible to perform overload resolution based on a list of argument types.



```id
tsdeclare function stringOrNum(x: string): number;declare function stringOrNum(x: number): string;declare function stringOrNum(x: string | number): string | number; type T1 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<typeof stringOrNum>;     type T1 = string | numberTry
```



## Distributive Conditional Types

When conditional types act on a generic type, they become distributive when given a union type.
For example, take the following:



```id
tstype  = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<' >Type> = ' >Type extends any ? ' >Type[] : never;Try
```



If we plug a union type into `ToArray`, then the conditional type will be applied to each member of that union.



```id
tstype  = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<' >Type> = ' >Type extends any ? ' >Type[] : never; type StrArrOrNumArr =  = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<string | number>;           type StrArrOrNumArr = string[] | number[]Try
```



What happens here is that `ToArray` distributes on:



```id
ts  string | number;Try
```



and maps over each member type of the union, to what is effectively:



```id
ts   = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<string> |  = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<number>;Try
```



which leaves us with:



```id
ts  string[] | number[];Try
```



Typically, distributivity is the desired behavior.
To avoid that behavior, you can surround each side of the `extends` keyword with square brackets.



```id
tstype  = [Type] extends [any] ? Type[] : never' >ToArrayNonDist<' >Type> = [' >Type] extends [any] ? ' >Type[] : never; // &apos;ArrOfStrOrNum&apos; is no longer a union.type ArrOfStrOrNum =  = [Type] extends [any] ? Type[] : never' >ToArrayNonDist<string | number>;          type ArrOfStrOrNum = (string | number)[]Try
```

### TypeScript: Documentation - More on Functions

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#handbook-content

- TypeScript: Documentation - More on Functions

# More on Functions

 

Functions are the basic building block of any application, whether they’re local functions, imported from another module, or methods on a class.
They’re also values, and just like other values, TypeScript has many ways to describe how functions can be called.
Let’s learn about how to write types that describe functions.

## Function Type Expressions

The simplest way to describe a function is with a function type expression .
These types are syntactically similar to arrow functions:



```id
tsfunction  void): void' >greeter( void' >fn: (a: string) => void) {   void' >fn("Hello, World");} function printToConsole(s: string) {  console.log(s);}  void): void' >greeter(printToConsole);Try
```



The syntax `(a: string) => void` means “a function with one parameter, named `a`, of type `string`, that doesn’t have a return value”.
Just like with function declarations, if a parameter type isn’t specified, it’s implicitly `any`.

 

Note that the parameter name is required . The function type `(string) => void` means “a function with a parameter named `string` of type `any`“!

 

Of course, we can use a type alias to name a function type:



```id
tstype  void' >GreetFunction = (a: string) => void;function greeter(fn:  void' >GreetFunction) {  // ...}Try
```



## Call Signatures

In JavaScript, functions can have properties in addition to being callable.
However, the function type expression syntax doesn’t allow for declaring properties.
If we want to describe something callable with properties, we can write a call signature in an object type:



```id
tstype DescribableFunction = {  description: string;  (someArg: number): boolean;};function doSomething(fn: DescribableFunction) {  console.log(fn.description + " returned " +  boolean' >fn(6));} function myFunc(someArg: number) {  return someArg > 3;}myFunc.description = "default description"; doSomething(myFunc);Try
```



Note that the syntax is slightly different compared to a function type expression - use `:` between the parameter list and the return type rather than `=>`.

## Construct Signatures

JavaScript functions can also be invoked with the `new` operator.
TypeScript refers to these as constructors because they usually create a new object.
You can write a construct signature by adding the `new` keyword in front of a call signature:



```id
tstype  SomeObject' >SomeConstructor = {  new (s: string): SomeObject;};function fn(ctor:  SomeObject' >SomeConstructor) {  return new  SomeObject' >ctor("hello");}Try
```



Some objects, like JavaScript’s `Date` object, can be called with or without `new`.
You can combine call and construct signatures in the same type arbitrarily:



```id
tsinterface CallOrConstruct {  (n?: number): string;  new (s: string): Date;} function fn(ctor: CallOrConstruct) {  // Passing an argument of type `number` to `ctor` matches it against  // the first definition in the `CallOrConstruct` interface.  console.log( string' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>ctor(10));               (parameter) ctor: CallOrConstruct
(n?: number) => string   // Similarly, passing an argument of type `string` to `ctor` matches it  // against the second definition in the `CallOrConstruct` interface.  console.log(new  Date' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>ctor("10"));                   (parameter) ctor: CallOrConstruct
new (s: string) => Date} fn(Date);Try
```



## Generic Functions

It’s common to write a function where the types of the input relate to the type of the output, or where the types of two inputs are related in some way.
Let’s consider for a moment a function that returns the first element of an array:



```id
tsfunction firstElement(arr: any[]) {  return arr[0];}Try
```



This function does its job, but unfortunately has the return type `any`.
It’d be better if the function returned the type of the array element.

In TypeScript, generics are used when we want to describe a correspondence between two values.
We do this by declaring a type parameter in the function signature:



```id
tsfunction (arr: Type[]): Type | undefined' >firstElement<(arr: Type[]): Type | undefined' >Type>(arr: (arr: Type[]): Type | undefined' >Type[]): (arr: Type[]): Type | undefined' >Type | undefined {  return arr[0];}Try
```



By adding a type parameter `Type` to this function and using it in two places, we’ve created a link between the input of the function (the array) and the output (the return value).
Now when we call it, a more specific type comes out:



```id
ts// s is of type &apos;string&apos;const s = (arr: string[]): string | undefined' >firstElement(["a", "b", "c"]);// n is of type &apos;number&apos;const n = (arr: number[]): number | undefined' >firstElement([1, 2, 3]);// u is of type undefinedconst u = (arr: never[]): undefined' >firstElement([]);Try
```



### Inference

Note that we didn’t have to specify `Type` in this sample.
The type was inferred - chosen automatically - by TypeScript.

We can use multiple type parameters as well.
For example, a standalone version of `map` would look like this:



```id
tsfunction (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >map<(arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Input, (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Output>(arr: (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Input[],  Output' >func: (arg: (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Input) => (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Output): (arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[]' >Output[] {  return arr..map<Output>(callbackfn: (value: Input, index: number, array: Input[]) => Output, thisArg?: any): Output[]' >map( Output' >func);} // Parameter &apos;n&apos; is of type &apos;string&apos;// &apos;parsed&apos; is of type &apos;number[]&apos;const parsed = (arr: string[], func: (arg: string) => number): number[]' >map(["1", "2", "3"], (n) => parseInt(n));Try
```



Note that in this example, TypeScript could infer both the type of the `Input` type parameter (from the given `string` array), as well as the `Output` type parameter based on the return value of the function expression (`number`).

### Constraints

We’ve written some generic functions that can work on any kind of value.
Sometimes we want to relate two values, but can only operate on a certain subset of values.
In this case, we can use a constraint to limit the kinds of types that a type parameter can accept.

Let’s write a function that returns the longer of two values.
To do this, we need a `length` property that’s a number.
We constrain the type parameter to that type by writing an `extends` clause:



```id
tsfunction (a: Type, b: Type): Type' >longest<(a: Type, b: Type): Type' >Type extends { length: number }>(a: (a: Type, b: Type): Type' >Type, b: (a: Type, b: Type): Type' >Type) {  if (a.length >= b.length) {    return a;  } else {    return b;  }} // longerArray is of type &apos;number[]&apos;const longerArray = (a: number[], b: number[]): number[]' >longest([1, 2], [1, 2, 3]);// longerString is of type &apos;alice&apos; | &apos;bob&apos;const longerString = (a: "alice" | "bob", b: "alice" | "bob"): "alice" | "bob"' >longest("alice", "bob");// Error! Numbers don&apos;t have a &apos;length&apos; propertyconst notOK = (a: {
    length: number;
}, b: {
    length: number;
}): {
    length: number;
}' >longest(10, 100);Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ length: number; }'.2345Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ length: number; }'.Try
```



There are a few interesting things to note in this example.
We allowed TypeScript to infer the return type of `longest`.
Return type inference also works on generic functions.

Because we constrained `Type` to `{ length: number }`, we were allowed to access the `.length` property of the `a` and `b` parameters.
Without the type constraint, we wouldn’t be able to access those properties because the values might have been some other type without a length property.

The types of `longerArray` and `longerString` were inferred based on the arguments.
Remember, generics are all about relating two or more values with the same type!

Finally, just as we’d like, the call to `longest(10, 100)` is rejected because the `number` type doesn’t have a `.length` property.

### Working with Constrained Values

Here’s a common error when working with generic constraints:



```id
tsfunction (obj: Type, minimum: number): Type' >minimumLength<(obj: Type, minimum: number): Type' >Type extends { length: number }>(  obj: (obj: Type, minimum: number): Type' >Type,  minimum: number): (obj: Type, minimum: number): Type' >Type {  if (obj.length >= minimum) {    return obj;  } else {    return { length: minimum };Type '{ length: number; }' is not assignable to type 'Type'.
  '{ length: number; }' is assignable to the constraint of type 'Type', but 'Type' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint '{ length: number; }'.2322Type '{ length: number; }' is not assignable to type 'Type'.
  '{ length: number; }' is assignable to the constraint of type 'Type', but 'Type' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint '{ length: number; }'.  }}Try
```



It might look like this function is OK - `Type` is constrained to `{ length: number }`, and the function either returns `Type` or a value matching that constraint.
The problem is that the function promises to return the same kind of object as was passed in, not just some object matching the constraint.
If this code were legal, you could write code that definitely wouldn’t work:



```id
ts// &apos;arr&apos; gets value { length: 6 }const arr = (obj: number[], minimum: number): number[]' >minimumLength([1, 2, 3], 6);// and crashes here because arrays have// a &apos;slice&apos; method, but not the returned object!console.log(arr..slice(start?: number, end?: number): number[]' >slice(0));Try
```



### Specifying Type Arguments

TypeScript can usually infer the intended type arguments in a generic call, but not always.
For example, let’s say you wrote a function to combine two arrays:



```id
tsfunction (arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >combine<(arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >Type>(arr1: (arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[], arr2: (arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[]): (arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[] {  return arr1..concat(...items: ConcatArray<Type>[]): Type[] (+1 overload)' >concat(arr2);}Try
```



Normally it would be an error to call this function with mismatched arrays:



```id
tsconst arr = (arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): number[]' >combine([1, 2, 3], ["hello"]);Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.Try
```



If you intended to do this, however, you could manually specify `Type`:



```id
tsconst arr = (arr1: (string | number)[], arr2: (string | number)[]): (string | number)[]' >combine<string | number>([1, 2, 3], ["hello"]);Try
```



### Guidelines for Writing Good Generic Functions

Writing generic functions is fun, and it can be easy to get carried away with type parameters.
Having too many type parameters or using constraints where they aren’t needed can make inference less successful, frustrating callers of your function.

#### Push Type Parameters Down

Here are two ways of writing a function that appear similar:



```id
tsfunction (arr: Type[]): Type' >firstElement1<(arr: Type[]): Type' >Type>(arr: (arr: Type[]): Type' >Type[]) {  return arr[0];} function (arr: Type): any' >firstElement2<(arr: Type): any' >Type extends any[]>(arr: (arr: Type): any' >Type) {  return arr[0];} // a: number (good)const a = (arr: number[]): number' >firstElement1([1, 2, 3]);// b: any (bad)const b = (arr: number[]): any' >firstElement2([1, 2, 3]);Try
```



These might seem identical at first glance, but `firstElement1` is a much better way to write this function.
Its inferred return type is `Type`, but `firstElement2`’s inferred return type is `any` because TypeScript has to resolve the `arr[0]` expression using the constraint type, rather than “waiting” to resolve the element during a call.

 

 Rule : When possible, use the type parameter itself rather than constraining it

 

#### Use Fewer Type Parameters

Here’s another pair of similar functions:



```id
tsfunction (arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >filter1<(arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >Type>(arr: (arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >Type[],  boolean' >func: (arg: (arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >Type) => boolean): (arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[]' >Type[] {  return arr..filter(predicate: (value: Type, index: number, array: Type[]) => unknown, thisArg?: any): Type[] (+1 overload)' >filter( boolean' >func);} function  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >filter2< boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Type,  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Func extends (arg:  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Type) => boolean>(  arr:  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Type[],   boolean' >func:  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Func):  boolean>(arr: Type[], func: Func): Type[]' >Type[] {  return arr..filter(predicate: (value: Type, index: number, array: Type[]) => unknown, thisArg?: any): Type[] (+1 overload)' >filter( boolean' >func);}Try
```



We’ve created a type parameter `Func` that doesn’t relate two values .
That’s always a red flag, because it means callers wanting to specify type arguments have to manually specify an extra type argument for no reason.
`Func` doesn’t do anything but make the function harder to read and reason about!

 

 Rule : Always use as few type parameters as possible

 

#### Type Parameters Should Appear Twice

Sometimes we forget that a function might not need to be generic:



```id
tsfunction (s: Str): void' >greet<(s: Str): void' >Str extends string>(s: (s: Str): void' >Str) {  console.log("Hello, " + s);} (s: "world"): void' >greet("world");Try
```



We could just as easily have written a simpler version:



```id
tsfunction greet(s: string) {  console.log("Hello, " + s);}Try
```



Remember, type parameters are for relating the types of multiple values .
If a type parameter is only used once in the function signature, it’s not relating anything.
This includes the inferred return type; for example, if `Str` was part of the inferred return type of `greet`, it would be relating the argument and return types, so would be used twice despite appearing only once in the written code.

 

 Rule : If a type parameter only appears in one location, strongly reconsider if you actually need it

 

## Optional Parameters

Functions in JavaScript often take a variable number of arguments.
For example, the `toFixed` method of `number` takes an optional digit count:



```id
tsfunction f(n: number) {  console.log(n.toFixed()); // 0 arguments  console.log(n.toFixed(3)); // 1 argument}Try
```



We can model this in TypeScript by marking the parameter as optional with `?`:



```id
tsfunction f(x?: number) {  // ...}f(); // OKf(10); // OKTry
```



Although the parameter is specified as type `number`, the `x` parameter will actually have the type `number | undefined` because unspecified parameters in JavaScript get the value `undefined`.

You can also provide a parameter default :



```id
tsfunction f(x = 10) {  // ...}Try
```



Now in the body of `f`, `x` will have type `number` because any `undefined` argument will be replaced with `10`.
Note that when a parameter is optional, callers can always pass `undefined`, as this simply simulates a “missing” argument:



```id
ts// All OKf();f(10);f(undefined);Try
```



### Optional Parameters in Callbacks

Once you’ve learned about optional parameters and function type expressions, it’s very easy to make the following mistakes when writing functions that invoke callbacks:



```id
tsfunction  void): void' >myForEach(arr: any[],  void' >callback: (arg: any, index?: number) => void) {  for (let i = 0; i < arr..length: number' >length; i++) {     void' >callback(arr[i], i);  }}Try
```



What people usually intend when writing `index?` as an optional parameter is that they want both of these calls to be legal:



```id
ts void): void' >myForEach([1, 2, 3], (a) => console.log(a)); void): void' >myForEach([1, 2, 3], (a, i) => console.log(a, i));Try
```



What this actually means is that `callback` might get invoked with one argument .
In other words, the function definition says that the implementation might look like this:



```id
tsfunction  void): void' >myForEach(arr: any[],  void' >callback: (arg: any, index?: number) => void) {  for (let i = 0; i < arr..length: number' >length; i++) {    // I don&apos;t feel like providing the index today     void' >callback(arr[i]);  }}Try
```



In turn, TypeScript will enforce this meaning and issue errors that aren’t really possible:

 


```id
ts void): void' >myForEach([1, 2, 3], (a, i) => {  console.log(i.toFixed());'i' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'i' is possibly 'undefined'.});Try
```



In JavaScript, if you call a function with more arguments than there are parameters, the extra arguments are simply ignored.
TypeScript behaves the same way.
Functions with fewer parameters (of the same types) can always take the place of functions with more parameters.

 

 Rule : When writing a function type for a callback, never write an optional parameter unless you intend to call the function without passing that argument

 

## Function Overloads

Some JavaScript functions can be called in a variety of argument counts and types.
For example, you might write a function to produce a `Date` that takes either a timestamp (one argument) or a month/day/year specification (three arguments).

In TypeScript, we can specify a function that can be called in different ways by writing overload signatures .
To do this, write some number of function signatures (usually two or more), followed by the body of the function:



```id
tsfunction makeDate(timestamp: number): Date;function makeDate(m: number, d: number, y: number): Date;function makeDate(mOrTimestamp: number, d?: number, y?: number): Date {  if (d !== undefined && y !== undefined) {    return new  Date (+4 overloads)' >Date(y, mOrTimestamp, d);  } else {    return new  Date (+4 overloads)' >Date(mOrTimestamp);  }}const d1 = makeDate(12345678);const d2 = makeDate(5, 5, 5);const d3 = makeDate(1, 3);No overload expects 2 arguments, but overloads do exist that expect either 1 or 3 arguments.2575No overload expects 2 arguments, but overloads do exist that expect either 1 or 3 arguments.Try
```



In this example, we wrote two overloads: one accepting one argument, and another accepting three arguments.
These first two signatures are called the overload signatures .

Then, we wrote a function implementation with a compatible signature.
Functions have an implementation signature, but this signature can’t be called directly.
Even though we wrote a function with two optional parameters after the required one, it can’t be called with two parameters!

### Overload Signatures and the Implementation Signature

This is a common source of confusion.
Often people will write code like this and not understand why there is an error:



```id
tsfunction fn(x: string): void;function fn() {  // ...}// Expected to be able to call with zero argumentsfn();Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.2554Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.Try
```



Again, the signature used to write the function body can’t be “seen” from the outside.

 

The signature of the implementation is not visible from the outside.
When writing an overloaded function, you should always have two or more signatures above the implementation of the function.

 

The implementation signature must also be compatible with the overload signatures.
For example, these functions have errors because the implementation signature doesn’t match the overloads in a correct way:



```id
tsfunction fn(x: boolean): void;// Argument type isn&apos;t rightfunction fn(x: string): void;This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.2394This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.function fn(x: boolean) {}Try
```




```id
tsfunction fn(x: string): string;// Return type isn&apos;t rightfunction fn(x: number): boolean;This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.2394This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.function fn(x: string | number) {  return "oops";}Try
```



### Writing Good Overloads

Like generics, there are a few guidelines you should follow when using function overloads.
Following these principles will make your function easier to call, easier to understand, and easier to implement.

Let’s consider a function that returns the length of a string or an array:



```id
tsfunction len(s: string): number;function len(arr: any[]): number;function len(x: any) {  return x.length;}Try
```



This function is fine; we can invoke it with strings or arrays.
However, we can’t invoke it with a value that might be a string or an array, because TypeScript can only resolve a function call to a single overload:



```id
tslen(""); // OKlen([0]); // OKlen(Math.random() > 0.5 ? "hello" : [0]);No overload matches this call.
  Overload 1 of 2, '(s: string): number', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'number[] | "hello"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
      Type 'number[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.
  Overload 2 of 2, '(arr: any[]): number', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'number[] | "hello"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'any[]'.
      Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'any[]'.2769No overload matches this call.
  Overload 1 of 2, '(s: string): number', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'number[] | "hello"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
      Type 'number[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.
  Overload 2 of 2, '(arr: any[]): number', gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'number[] | "hello"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'any[]'.
      Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'any[]'.Try
```



Because both overloads have the same argument count and same return type, we can instead write a non-overloaded version of the function:



```id
tsfunction len(x: any[] | string) {  return x.length;}Try
```



This is much better!
Callers can invoke this with either sort of value, and as an added bonus, we don’t have to figure out a correct implementation signature.

 

Always prefer parameters with union types instead of overloads when possible

 

## Declaring `this` in a Function

TypeScript will infer what the `this` should be in a function via code flow analysis, for example in the following:



```id
tsconst  void;
}' >user = {  id: 123,   admin: false,   void' >becomeAdmin: function () {    this.admin = true;  },};Try
```



TypeScript understands that the function `user.becomeAdmin` has a corresponding `this` which is the outer object `user`. `this`, heh , can be enough for a lot of cases, but there are a lot of cases where you need more control over what object `this` represents. The JavaScript specification states that you cannot have a parameter called `this`, and so TypeScript uses that syntax space to let you declare the type for `this` in the function body.



```id
tsinterface DB {   boolean): User[]' >filterUsers( boolean' >filter: (this: User) => boolean): User[];} const db =  DB' >getDB();const admins = db. boolean): User[]' >filterUsers(function (this: User) {  return this.admin;});Try
```



This pattern is common with callback-style APIs, where another object typically controls when your function is called. Note that you need to use `function` and not arrow functions to get this behavior:



```id
tsinterface DB {   boolean): User[]' >filterUsers( boolean' >filter: (this: User) => boolean): User[];} const db =  DB' >getDB();const admins = db. boolean): User[]' >filterUsers(() => this.admin);The containing arrow function captures the global value of 'this'.Element implicitly has an 'any' type because type 'typeof globalThis' has no index signature.7041
7017The containing arrow function captures the global value of 'this'.Element implicitly has an 'any' type because type 'typeof globalThis' has no index signature.Try
```



## Other Types to Know About

There are some additional types you’ll want to recognize that appear often when working with function types.
Like all types, you can use them everywhere, but these are especially relevant in the context of functions.

### `void`

`void` represents the return value of functions which don’t return a value.
It’s the inferred type any time a function doesn’t have any `return` statements, or doesn’t return any explicit value from those return statements:



```id
ts// The inferred return type is voidfunction noop() {  return;}Try
```



In JavaScript, a function that doesn’t return any value will implicitly return the value `undefined`.
However, `void` and `undefined` are not the same thing in TypeScript.
There are further details at the end of this chapter.

 

`void` is not the same as `undefined`.

 

### `object`

The special type `object` refers to any value that isn’t a primitive (`string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null`, or `undefined`).
This is different from the empty object type `{ }`, and also different from the global type `Object`.
It’s very likely you will never use `Object`.

 

`object` is not `Object`. Always use `object`!

 

Note that in JavaScript, function values are objects: They have properties, have `Object.prototype` in their prototype chain, are `instanceof Object`, you can call `Object.keys` on them, and so on.
For this reason, function types are considered to be `object`s in TypeScript.

### `unknown`

The `unknown` type represents any value.
This is similar to the `any` type, but is safer because it’s not legal to do anything with an `unknown` value:



```id
tsfunction f1(a: any) {  a.b(); // OK}function f2(a: unknown) {  a.b();'a' is of type 'unknown'.18046'a' is of type 'unknown'.}Try
```



This is useful when describing function types because you can describe functions that accept any value without having `any` values in your function body.

Conversely, you can describe a function that returns a value of unknown type:



```id
tsfunction safeParse(s: string): unknown {  return JSON. any): any' >parse(s);} // Need to be careful with &apos;obj&apos;!const obj = safeParse(someRandomString);Try
```



### `never`

Some functions never return a value:



```id
tsfunction fail(msg: string): never {  throw new  Error' >Error(msg);}Try
```



The `never` type represents values which are never observed.
In a return type, this means that the function throws an exception or terminates execution of the program.

`never` also appears when TypeScript determines there’s nothing left in a union.



```id
tsfunction fn(x: string | number) {  if (typeof x === "string") {    // do something  } else if (typeof x === "number") {    // do something else  } else {    x; // has type &apos;never&apos;!  }}Try
```



### `Function`

The global type `Function` describes properties like `bind`, `call`, `apply`, and others present on all function values in JavaScript.
It also has the special property that values of type `Function` can always be called; these calls return `any`:



```id
tsfunction doSomething(f: Function) {  return f(1, 2, 3);}Try
```



This is an untyped function call and is generally best avoided because of the unsafe `any` return type.

If you need to accept an arbitrary function but don’t intend to call it, the type `() => void` is generally safer.

## Rest Parameters and Arguments

 
 

Background Reading:

 Rest Parameters 

 Spread Syntax 

 


 

### Rest Parameters

In addition to using optional parameters or overloads to make functions that can accept a variety of fixed argument counts, we can also define functions that take an unbounded number of arguments using rest parameters .

A rest parameter appears after all other parameters, and uses the `...` syntax:



```id
tsfunction multiply(n: number, ...m: number[]) {  return m..map<number>(callbackfn: (value: number, index: number, array: number[]) => number, thisArg?: any): number[]' >map((x) => n * x);}// &apos;a&apos; gets value [10, 20, 30, 40]const a = multiply(10, 1, 2, 3, 4);Try
```



In TypeScript, the type annotation on these parameters is implicitly `any[]` instead of `any`, and any type annotation given must be of the form `Array ` or `T[]`, or a tuple type (which we’ll learn about later).

### Rest Arguments

Conversely, we can provide a variable number of arguments from an iterable object (for example, an array) using the spread syntax.
For example, the `push` method of arrays takes any number of arguments:



```id
tsconst arr1 = [1, 2, 3];const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];arr1..push(...items: number[]): number' >push(...arr2);Try
```



Note that in general, TypeScript does not assume that arrays are immutable.
This can lead to some surprising behavior:



```id
ts// Inferred type is number[] -- "an array with zero or more numbers",// not specifically two numbersconst args = [8, 5];const angle = Math.atan2(...args);A spread argument must either have a tuple type or be passed to a rest parameter.2556A spread argument must either have a tuple type or be passed to a rest parameter.Try
```



The best fix for this situation depends a bit on your code, but in general a `const` context is the most straightforward solution:



```id
ts// Inferred as 2-length tupleconst args = [8, 5] as const;// OKconst angle = Math.atan2(...args);Try
```



Using rest arguments may require turning on `downlevelIteration` when targeting older runtimes.

 

## Parameter Destructuring

 
 

Background Reading:

 Destructuring Assignment 

 


 

You can use parameter destructuring to conveniently unpack objects provided as an argument into one or more local variables in the function body.
In JavaScript, it looks like this:



```id
jsfunction sum({ a, b, c }) {  console.log(a + b + c);}sum({ a: 10, b: 3, c: 9 });
```



The type annotation for the object goes after the destructuring syntax:



```id
tsfunction sum({ a, b, c }: { a: number; b: number; c: number }) {  console.log(a + b + c);}Try
```



This can look a bit verbose, but you can use a named type here as well:



```id
ts// Same as prior exampletype ABC = { a: number; b: number; c: number };function sum({ a, b, c }: ABC) {  console.log(a + b + c);}Try
```



## Assignability of Functions

### Return type `void`

The `void` return type for functions can produce some unusual, but expected behavior.

Contextual typing with a return type of `void` does not force functions to not return something. Another way to say this is a contextual function type with a `void` return type (`type voidFunc = () => void`), when implemented, can return any other value, but it will be ignored.

Thus, the following implementations of the type `() => void` are valid:



```id
tstype  void' >voidFunc = () => void; const f1:  void' >voidFunc = () => {  return true;}; const f2:  void' >voidFunc = () => true; const f3:  void' >voidFunc = function () {  return true;};Try
```



And when the return value of one of these functions is assigned to another variable, it will retain the type of `void`:



```id
tsconst v1 =  void' >f1(); const v2 =  void' >f2(); const v3 =  void' >f3();Try
```



This behavior exists so that the following code is valid even though `Array.prototype.push` returns a number and the `Array.prototype.forEach` method expects a function with a return type of `void`.



```id
tsconst src = [1, 2, 3];const dst = [0]; src..forEach(callbackfn: (value: number, index: number, array: number[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((el) => dst..push(...items: number[]): number' >push(el));Try
```



There is one other special case to be aware of, when a literal function definition has a `void` return type, that function must not return anything.



```id
tsfunction f2(): void {  // @ts-expect-error  return true;} const  void' >f3 = function (): void {  // @ts-expect-error  return true;};Try
```

# Mapped Types

 

When you don’t want to repeat yourself, sometimes a type needs to be based on another type.

Mapped types build on the syntax for index signatures, which are used to declare the types of properties which have not been declared ahead of time:



```id
tstype OnlyBoolsAndHorses = {  [key: string]: boolean | Horse;}; const conforms: OnlyBoolsAndHorses = {  del: true,  rodney: false,};Try
```



A mapped type is a generic type which uses a union of `PropertyKey`s (frequently created via a `keyof` ) to iterate through keys to create a type:



```id
tstype  = { [Property in keyof Type]: boolean; }' >OptionsFlags<' >Type> = {  [Property in keyof ' >Type]: boolean;};Try
```



In this example, `OptionsFlags` will take all the properties from the type `Type` and change their values to be a boolean.



```id
tstype  void;
    newUserProfile: () => void;
}' >Features = {   void' >darkMode: () => void;   void' >newUserProfile: () => void;}; type FeatureOptions =  = { [Property in keyof Type]: boolean; }' >OptionsFlags< void;
    newUserProfile: () => void;
}' >Features>;           type FeatureOptions = {
    darkMode: boolean;
    newUserProfile: boolean;
}Try
```



### Mapping Modifiers

There are two additional modifiers which can be applied during mapping: `readonly` and `?` which affect mutability and optionality respectively.

You can remove or add these modifiers by prefixing with `-` or `+`. If you don’t add a prefix, then `+` is assumed.



```id
ts// Removes &apos;readonly&apos; attributes from a type&apos;s propertiestype  = { -readonly [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property]; }' >CreateMutable<' >Type> = {  -readonly [Property in keyof ' >Type]: ' >Type[Property];}; type LockedAccount = {  readonly id: string;  readonly name: string;}; type UnlockedAccount =  = { -readonly [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property]; }' >CreateMutable<LockedAccount>;           type UnlockedAccount = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
}Try
```




```id
ts// Removes &apos;optional&apos; attributes from a type&apos;s propertiestype  = { [Property in keyof Type]-?: Type[Property]; }' >Concrete<' >Type> = {  [Property in keyof ' >Type]-?: ' >Type[Property];}; type MaybeUser = {  id: string;  name?: string;  age?: number;}; type User =  = { [Property in keyof Type]-?: Type[Property]; }' >Concrete<MaybeUser>;      type User = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;
}Try
```



## Key Remapping via `as`

In TypeScript 4.1 and onwards, you can re-map keys in mapped types with an `as` clause in a mapped type:



```id
tstype MappedTypeWithNewProperties<Type> = {    [Properties in keyof Type as NewKeyType]: Type[Properties]}
```



You can leverage features like template literal types to create new property names from prior ones:



```id
tstype  = { [Property in keyof Type as `get${Capitalize<string & Property>}`]: () => Type[Property]; }' >Getters<' >Type> = {    [Property in keyof ' >Type as `get${ = intrinsic' >Capitalize<string & Property>}`]: () => ' >Type[Property]}; interface Person {    name: string;    age: number;    location: string;} type  string;
    getAge: () => number;
    getLocation: () => string;
}' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>LazyPerson =  = { [Property in keyof Type as `get${Capitalize<string & Property>}`]: () => Type[Property]; }' >Getters<Person>;         type LazyPerson = {
    getName: () => string;
    getAge: () => number;
    getLocation: () => string;
}Try
```



You can filter out keys by producing `never` via a conditional type:



```id
ts// Remove the &apos;kind&apos; propertytype  = { [Property in keyof Type as Exclude<Property, "kind">]: Type[Property]; }' >RemoveKindField<' >Type> = {    [Property in keyof ' >Type as  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<Property, "kind">]: ' >Type[Property]}; interface Circle {    kind: "circle";    radius: number;} type KindlessCircle =  = { [Property in keyof Type as Exclude<Property, "kind">]: Type[Property]; }' >RemoveKindField<Circle>;           type KindlessCircle = {
    radius: number;
}Try
```



You can map over arbitrary unions, not just unions of `string | number | symbol`, but unions of any type:



```id
tstype  = { [E in Events as E["kind"]]: (event: E) => void; }' >EventConfig<' >Events extends { kind: string }> = {    [E in ' >Events as E["kind"]]: (event: E) => void;} type SquareEvent = { kind: "square", x: number, y: number };type CircleEvent = { kind: "circle", radius: number }; type  void;
    circle: (event: CircleEvent) => void;
}' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>Config =  = { [E in Events as E["kind"]]: (event: E) => void; }' >EventConfig<SquareEvent | CircleEvent>       type Config = {
    square: (event: SquareEvent) => void;
    circle: (event: CircleEvent) => void;
}Try
```



### Further Exploration

Mapped types work well with other features in this type manipulation section, for example here is a mapped type using a conditional type which returns either a `true` or `false` depending on whether an object has the property `pii` set to the literal `true`:



```id
tstype  = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends {
    pii: true;
} ? true : false; }' >ExtractPII<' >Type> = {  [Property in keyof ' >Type]: ' >Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false;}; type DBFields = {  id: { format: "incrementing" };  name: { type: string; pii: true };}; type ObjectsNeedingGDPRDeletion =  = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends {
    pii: true;
} ? true : false; }' >ExtractPII<DBFields>;                 type ObjectsNeedingGDPRDeletion = {
    id: false;
    name: true;
}Try
```

# Object Types

 

In JavaScript, the fundamental way that we group and pass around data is through objects.
In TypeScript, we represent those through object types .

As we’ve seen, they can be anonymous:



```id
tsfunction greet(person: { name: string; age: number }) {  return "Hello " + person.name;}Try
```



or they can be named by using either an interface:



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age: number;} function greet(person: Person) {  return "Hello " + person.name;}Try
```



or a type alias:



```id
tstype Person = {  name: string;  age: number;}; function greet(person: Person) {  return "Hello " + person.name;}Try
```



In all three examples above, we’ve written functions that take objects that contain the property `name` (which must be a `string`) and `age` (which must be a `number`).

## Quick Reference

We have cheat-sheets available for both `type` and `interface` , if you want a quick look at the important every-day syntax at a glance.

## Property Modifiers

Each property in an object type can specify a couple of things: the type, whether the property is optional, and whether the property can be written to.

### Optional Properties

Much of the time, we’ll find ourselves dealing with objects that might have a property set.
In those cases, we can mark those properties as optional by adding a question mark (`?`) to the end of their names.



```id
tsinterface PaintOptions {  shape: Shape;  xPos?: number;  yPos?: number;} function paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {  // ...} const shape = getShape();paintShape({ shape });paintShape({ shape, xPos: 100 });paintShape({ shape, yPos: 100 });paintShape({ shape, xPos: 100, yPos: 100 });Try
```



In this example, both `xPos` and `yPos` are considered optional.
We can choose to provide either of them, so every call above to `paintShape` is valid.
All optionality really says is that if the property is set, it better have a specific type.

We can also read from those properties - but when we do under `strictNullChecks` , TypeScript will tell us they’re potentially `undefined`.



```id
tsfunction paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {  let xPos = opts.xPos;                   (property) PaintOptions.xPos?: number | undefined  let yPos = opts.yPos;                   (property) PaintOptions.yPos?: number | undefined  // ...}Try
```



In JavaScript, even if the property has never been set, we can still access it - it’s just going to give us the value `undefined`.
We can just handle `undefined` specially by checking for it.



```id
tsfunction paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {  let xPos = opts.xPos === undefined ? 0 : opts.xPos;       let xPos: number  let yPos = opts.yPos === undefined ? 0 : opts.yPos;       let yPos: number  // ...}Try
```



Note that this pattern of setting defaults for unspecified values is so common that JavaScript has syntax to support it.



```id
tsfunction paintShape({ shape, xPos = 0, yPos = 0 }: PaintOptions) {  console.log("x coordinate at", xPos);                                  (parameter) xPos: number  console.log("y coordinate at", yPos);                                  (parameter) yPos: number  // ...}Try
```



Here we used a destructuring pattern for `paintShape`’s parameter, and provided default values for `xPos` and `yPos`.
Now `xPos` and `yPos` are both definitely present within the body of `paintShape`, but optional for any callers to `paintShape`.

 

Note that there is currently no way to place type annotations within destructuring patterns.
This is because the following syntax already means something different in JavaScript.



```id
tsfunction draw({ shape: Shape, xPos: number = 100 /*...*/ }) {  render(shape);Cannot find name 'shape'. Did you mean 'Shape'?2552Cannot find name 'shape'. Did you mean 'Shape'?  render(xPos);Cannot find name 'xPos'.2304Cannot find name 'xPos'.}Try
```



In an object destructuring pattern, `shape: Shape` means “grab the property `shape` and redefine it locally as a variable named `Shape`.”
Likewise `xPos: number` creates a variable named `number` whose value is based on the parameter’s `xPos`.

 

### `readonly` Properties

Properties can also be marked as `readonly` for TypeScript.
While it won’t change any behavior at runtime, a property marked as `readonly` can’t be written to during type-checking.



```id
tsinterface SomeType {  readonly prop: string;} function doSomething(obj: SomeType) {  // We can read from &apos;obj.prop&apos;.  console.log(`prop has the value &apos;${obj.prop}&apos;.`);   // But we can&apos;t re-assign it.  obj.prop = "hello";Cannot assign to 'prop' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'prop' because it is a read-only property.}Try
```



Using the `readonly` modifier doesn’t necessarily imply that a value is totally immutable - or in other words, that its internal contents can’t be changed.
It just means the property itself can’t be re-written to.



```id
tsinterface Home {  readonly resident: { name: string; age: number };} function visitForBirthday(home: Home) {  // We can read and update properties from &apos;home.resident&apos;.  console.log(`Happy birthday ${home.resident.name}!`);  home.resident.age++;} function evict(home: Home) {  // But we can&apos;t write to the &apos;resident&apos; property itself on a &apos;Home&apos;.  home.resident = {Cannot assign to 'resident' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'resident' because it is a read-only property.    name: "Victor the Evictor",    age: 42,  };}Try
```



It’s important to manage expectations of what `readonly` implies.
It’s useful to signal intent during development time for TypeScript on how an object should be used.
TypeScript doesn’t factor in whether properties on two types are `readonly` when checking whether those types are compatible, so `readonly` properties can also change via aliasing.



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age: number;} interface ReadonlyPerson {  readonly name: string;  readonly age: number;} let writablePerson: Person = {  name: "Person McPersonface",  age: 42,}; // workslet readonlyPerson: ReadonlyPerson = writablePerson; console.log(readonlyPerson.age); // prints &apos;42&apos;writablePerson.age++;console.log(readonlyPerson.age); // prints &apos;43&apos;Try
```



Using mapping modifiers , you can remove `readonly` attributes.

### Index Signatures

Sometimes you don’t know all the names of a type’s properties ahead of time, but you do know the shape of the values.

In those cases you can use an index signature to describe the types of possible values, for example:



```id
tsinterface StringArray {  [index: number]: string;} const myArray: StringArray = getStringArray();const secondItem = myArray[1];          const secondItem: stringTry
```



Above, we have a `StringArray` interface which has an index signature.
This index signature states that when a `StringArray` is indexed with a `number`, it will return a `string`.

Only some types are allowed for index signature properties: `string`, `number`, `symbol`, template string patterns, and union types consisting only of these.

 
 It is possible to support multiple types of indexers... 
 

It is possible to support multiple types of indexers. Note that when using both `number` and `string` indexers, the type returned from a numeric indexer must be a subtype of the type returned from the string indexer. This is because when indexing with a `number`, JavaScript will actually convert that to a `string` before indexing into an object. That means that indexing with `100` (a `number`) is the same thing as indexing with `"100"` (a `string`), so the two need to be consistent.



```id
tsinterface Animal {  name: string;} interface Dog extends Animal {  breed: string;} // Error: indexing with a numeric string might get you a completely separate type of Animal!interface NotOkay {  [x: number]: Animal;'number' index type 'Animal' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'Dog'.2413'number' index type 'Animal' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'Dog'.  [x: string]: Dog;}Try
```


 

While string index signatures are a powerful way to describe the “dictionary” pattern, they also enforce that all properties match their return type.
This is because a string index declares that `obj.property` is also available as `obj["property"]`.
In the following example, `name`’s type does not match the string index’s type, and the type checker gives an error:



```id
tsinterface NumberDictionary {  [index: string]: number;   length: number; // ok  name: string;Property 'name' of type 'string' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'number'.2411Property 'name' of type 'string' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'number'.}Try
```



However, properties of different types are acceptable if the index signature is a union of the property types:



```id
tsinterface NumberOrStringDictionary {  [index: string]: number | string;  length: number; // ok, length is a number  name: string; // ok, name is a string}Try
```



Finally, you can make index signatures `readonly` in order to prevent assignment to their indices:



```id
tsinterface ReadonlyStringArray {  readonly [index: number]: string;} let myArray: ReadonlyStringArray = getReadOnlyStringArray();myArray[2] = "Mallory";Index signature in type 'ReadonlyStringArray' only permits reading.2542Index signature in type 'ReadonlyStringArray' only permits reading.Try
```



You can’t set `myArray[2]` because the index signature is `readonly`.

## Excess Property Checks

Where and how an object is assigned a type can make a difference in the type system.
One of the key examples of this is in excess property checking, which validates the object more thoroughly when it is created and assigned to an object type during creation.



```id
tsinterface SquareConfig {  color?: string;  width?: number;} function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {  return {    color: config.color || "red",    area: config.width ? config.width * config.width : 20,  };} let mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 });Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?2561Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?Try
```



Notice the given argument to `createSquare` is spelled `colour` instead of `color`.
In plain JavaScript, this sort of thing fails silently.

You could argue that this program is correctly typed, since the `width` properties are compatible, there’s no `color` property present, and the extra `colour` property is insignificant.

However, TypeScript takes the stance that there’s probably a bug in this code.
Object literals get special treatment and undergo excess property checking when assigning them to other variables, or passing them as arguments.
If an object literal has any properties that the “target type” doesn’t have, you’ll get an error:



```id
tslet mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 });Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?2561Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?Try
```



Getting around these checks is actually really simple.
The easiest method is to just use a type assertion:



```id
tslet mySquare = createSquare({ width: 100, opacity: 0.5 } as SquareConfig);Try
```



However, a better approach might be to add a string index signature if you’re sure that the object can have some extra properties that are used in some special way.
If `SquareConfig` can have `color` and `width` properties with the above types, but could also have any number of other properties, then we could define it like so:



```id
tsinterface SquareConfig {  color?: string;  width?: number;  [propName: string]: unknown;}Try
```



Here we’re saying that `SquareConfig` can have any number of properties, and as long as they aren’t `color` or `width`, their types don’t matter.

One final way to get around these checks, which might be a bit surprising, is to assign the object to another variable:
Since assigning `squareOptions` won’t undergo excess property checks, the compiler won’t give you an error:



```id
tslet squareOptions = { colour: "red", width: 100 };let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);Try
```



The above workaround will work as long as you have a common property between `squareOptions` and `SquareConfig`.
In this example, it was the property `width`. It will however, fail if the variable does not have any common object property. For example:



```id
tslet squareOptions = { colour: "red" };let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);Type '{ colour: string; }' has no properties in common with type 'SquareConfig'.2559Type '{ colour: string; }' has no properties in common with type 'SquareConfig'.Try
```



Keep in mind that for simple code like above, you probably shouldn’t be trying to “get around” these checks.
For more complex object literals that have methods and hold state, you might need to keep these techniques in mind, but a majority of excess property errors are actually bugs.

That means if you’re running into excess property checking problems for something like option bags, you might need to revise some of your type declarations.
In this instance, if it’s okay to pass an object with both a `color` or `colour` property to `createSquare`, you should fix up the definition of `SquareConfig` to reflect that.

## Extending Types

It’s pretty common to have types that might be more specific versions of other types.
For example, we might have a `BasicAddress` type that describes the fields necessary for sending letters and packages in the U.S.



```id
tsinterface BasicAddress {  name?: string;  street: string;  city: string;  country: string;  postalCode: string;}Try
```



In some situations that’s enough, but addresses often have a unit number associated with them if the building at an address has multiple units.
We can then describe an `AddressWithUnit`.

 


```id
tsinterface AddressWithUnit {  name?: string;  unit: string;  street: string;  city: string;  country: string;  postalCode: string;}Try
```



This does the job, but the downside here is that we had to repeat all the other fields from `BasicAddress` when our changes were purely additive.
Instead, we can extend the original `BasicAddress` type and just add the new fields that are unique to `AddressWithUnit`.



```id
tsinterface BasicAddress {  name?: string;  street: string;  city: string;  country: string;  postalCode: string;} interface AddressWithUnit extends BasicAddress {  unit: string;}Try
```



The `extends` keyword on an `interface` allows us to effectively copy members from other named types, and add whatever new members we want.
This can be useful for cutting down the amount of type declaration boilerplate we have to write, and for signaling intent that several different declarations of the same property might be related.
For example, `AddressWithUnit` didn’t need to repeat the `street` property, and because `street` originates from `BasicAddress`, a reader will know that those two types are related in some way.

`interface`s can also extend from multiple types.



```id
tsinterface Colorful {  color: string;} interface Circle {  radius: number;} interface ColorfulCircle extends Colorful, Circle {} const cc: ColorfulCircle = {  color: "red",  radius: 42,};Try
```



## Intersection Types

`interface`s allowed us to build up new types from other types by extending them.
TypeScript provides another construct called intersection types that is mainly used to combine existing object types.

An intersection type is defined using the `&` operator.



```id
tsinterface Colorful {  color: string;}interface Circle {  radius: number;} type ColorfulCircle = Colorful & Circle;Try
```



Here, we’ve intersected `Colorful` and `Circle` to produce a new type that has all the members of `Colorful` and `Circle`.



```id
tsfunction draw(circle: Colorful & Circle) {  console.log(`Color was ${circle.color}`);  console.log(`Radius was ${circle.radius}`);} // okaydraw({ color: "blue", radius: 42 }); // oopsdraw({ color: "red", raidus: 42 });Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'raidus' does not exist in type 'Colorful & Circle'. Did you mean to write 'radius'?2561Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'raidus' does not exist in type 'Colorful & Circle'. Did you mean to write 'radius'?Try
```



## Interface Extension vs. Intersection

We just looked at two ways to combine types which are similar, but are actually subtly different.
With interfaces, we could use an `extends` clause to extend from other types, and we were able to do something similar with intersections and name the result with a type alias.
The principal difference between the two is how conflicts are handled, and that difference is typically one of the main reasons why you’d pick one over the other between an interface and a type alias of an intersection type.

If interfaces are defined with the same name, TypeScript will attempt to merge them if the properties are compatible. If the properties are not compatible (i.e., they have the same property name but different types), TypeScript will raise an error.

In the case of intersection types, properties with different types will be merged automatically. When the type is used later, TypeScript will expect the property to satisfy both types simultaneously, which may produce unexpected results.

For example, the following code will throw an error because the properties are incompatible:



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;}interface Person {  name: number;}
```



In contrast, the following code will compile, but it results in a `never` type:



```id
tsinterface Person1 {  name: string;} interface Person2 {  name: number;} type Staff = Person1 & Person2 declare const staffer: Staff;staffer.name;         (property) name: neverTry
```



In this case, Staff would require the name property to be both a string and a number, which results in property being of type `never`.

## Generic Object Types

Let’s imagine a `Box` type that can contain any value - `string`s, `number`s, `Giraffe`s, whatever.



```id
tsinterface Box {  contents: any;}Try
```



Right now, the `contents` property is typed as `any`, which works, but can lead to accidents down the line.

We could instead use `unknown`, but that would mean that in cases where we already know the type of `contents`, we’d need to do precautionary checks, or use error-prone type assertions.



```id
tsinterface Box {  contents: unknown;} let x: Box = {  contents: "hello world",}; // we could check &apos;x.contents&apos;if (typeof x.contents === "string") {  console.log(x.contents.toLowerCase());} // or we could use a type assertionconsole.log((x.contents as string).toLowerCase());Try
```



One type safe approach would be to instead scaffold out different `Box` types for every type of `contents`.



```id
tsinterface NumberBox {  contents: number;} interface StringBox {  contents: string;} interface BooleanBox {  contents: boolean;}Try
```



But that means we’ll have to create different functions, or overloads of functions, to operate on these types.



```id
tsfunction setContents(box: StringBox, newContents: string): void;function setContents(box: NumberBox, newContents: number): void;function setContents(box: BooleanBox, newContents: boolean): void;function setContents(box: { contents: any }, newContents: any) {  box.contents = newContents;}Try
```



That’s a lot of boilerplate. Moreover, we might later need to introduce new types and overloads.
This is frustrating, since our box types and overloads are all effectively the same.

Instead, we can make a generic `Box` type which declares a type parameter .



```id
tsinterface ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;}Try
```



You might read this as “A `Box` of `Type` is something whose `contents` have type `Type`”.
Later on, when we refer to `Box`, we have to give a type argument in place of `Type`.



```id
tslet ' >box: ' >Box<string>;Try
```



Think of `Box` as a template for a real type, where `Type` is a placeholder that will get replaced with some other type.
When TypeScript sees `Box `, it will replace every instance of `Type` in `Box ` with `string`, and end up working with something like `{ contents: string }`.
In other words, `Box ` and our earlier `StringBox` work identically.



```id
tsinterface ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;}interface StringBox {  contents: string;} let ' >boxA: ' >Box<string> = { .contents: string' >contents: "hello" };' >boxA..contents: string' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>contents;        (property) Box<string>.contents: string let boxB: StringBox = { contents: "world" };boxB.contents;        (property) StringBox.contents: stringTry
```



`Box` is reusable in that `Type` can be substituted with anything. That means that when we need a box for a new type, we don’t need to declare a new `Box` type at all (though we certainly could if we wanted to).



```id
tsinterface ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;} interface Apple {  // ....} // Same as &apos;{ contents: Apple }&apos;.type ' >AppleBox = ' >Box<Apple>;Try
```



This also means that we can avoid overloads entirely by instead using generic functions .



```id
tsfunction (box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type): void' >setContents<(box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type): void' >Type>(' >box: ' >Box<(box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type): void' >Type>, newContents: (box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type): void' >Type) {  ' >box..contents: Type' >contents = newContents;}Try
```



It is worth noting that type aliases can also be generic. We could have defined our new `Box ` interface, which was:



```id
tsinterface ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;}Try
```



by using a type alias instead:



```id
tstype  = {
    contents: Type;
}' >Box<' >Type> = {  contents: ' >Type;};Try
```



Since type aliases, unlike interfaces, can describe more than just object types, we can also use them to write other kinds of generic helper types.



```id
tstype  = Type | null' >OrNull<' >Type> = ' >Type | null; type  = Type | Type[]' >OneOrMany<' >Type> = ' >Type | ' >Type[]; type  = OneOrMany<Type> | null' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>OneOrManyOrNull<' >Type> =  = Type | null' >OrNull< = Type | Type[]' >OneOrMany<' >Type>>;           type OneOrManyOrNull<Type> = OneOrMany<Type> | null type  | null' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>OneOrManyOrNullStrings =  = OneOrMany<Type> | null' >OneOrManyOrNull<string>;               type OneOrManyOrNullStrings = OneOrMany<string> | nullTry
```



We’ll circle back to type aliases in just a little bit.

### The `Array` Type

Generic object types are often some sort of container type that work independently of the type of elements they contain.
It’s ideal for data structures to work this way so that they’re re-usable across different data types.

It turns out we’ve been working with a type just like that throughout this handbook: the `Array` type.
Whenever we write out types like `number[]` or `string[]`, that’s really just a shorthand for `Array ` and `Array `.



```id
tsfunction ): void' >doSomething(value: ' >Array<string>) {  // ...} let myArray: string[] = ["hello", "world"]; // either of these work!): void' >doSomething(myArray);): void' >doSomething(new (...items: string[]) => string[] (+2 overloads)' >Array("hello", "world"));Try
```



Much like the `Box` type above, `Array` itself is a generic type.



```id
tsinterface ' >Array<' >Type> {  /**   * Gets or sets the length of the array.   */  .length: number' >length: number;   /**   * Removes the last element from an array and returns it.   */  .pop(): Type | undefined' >pop(): ' >Type | undefined;   /**   * Appends new elements to an array, and returns the new length of the array.   */  .push(...items: Type[]): number' >push(...items: ' >Type[]): number;   // ...}Try
```



Modern JavaScript also provides other data structures which are generic, like `Map `, `Set `, and `Promise `.
All this really means is that because of how `Map`, `Set`, and `Promise` behave, they can work with any sets of types.

### The `ReadonlyArray` Type

The `ReadonlyArray` is a special type that describes arrays that shouldn’t be changed.



```id
tsfunction ): void' >doStuff(values: ' >ReadonlyArray<string>) {  // We can read from &apos;values&apos;...  const copy = values..slice(start?: number, end?: number): string[]' >slice();  console.log(`The first value is ${values[0]}`);   // ...but we can&apos;t mutate &apos;values&apos;.  values.push("hello!");Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.2339Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.}Try
```



Much like the `readonly` modifier for properties, it’s mainly a tool we can use for intent.
When we see a function that returns `ReadonlyArray`s, it tells us we’re not meant to change the contents at all, and when we see a function that consumes `ReadonlyArray`s, it tells us that we can pass any array into that function without worrying that it will change its contents.

Unlike `Array`, there isn’t a `ReadonlyArray` constructor that we can use.



```id
tsnew ReadonlyArray("red", "green", "blue");'ReadonlyArray' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.2693'ReadonlyArray' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.Try
```



Instead, we can assign regular `Array`s to `ReadonlyArray`s.



```id
tsconst roArray: ' >ReadonlyArray<string> = ["red", "green", "blue"];Try
```



Just as TypeScript provides a shorthand syntax for `Array ` with `Type[]`, it also provides a shorthand syntax for `ReadonlyArray ` with `readonly Type[]`.



```id
tsfunction doStuff(values: readonly string[]) {  // We can read from &apos;values&apos;...  const copy = values..slice(start?: number, end?: number): string[]' >slice();  console.log(`The first value is ${values[0]}`);   // ...but we can&apos;t mutate &apos;values&apos;.  values.push("hello!");Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.2339Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.}Try
```



One last thing to note is that unlike the `readonly` property modifier, assignability isn’t bidirectional between regular `Array`s and `ReadonlyArray`s.



```id
tslet x: readonly string[] = [];let y: string[] = []; x = y;y = x;The type 'readonly string[]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type 'string[]'.4104The type 'readonly string[]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type 'string[]'.Try
```



### Tuple Types

A tuple type is another sort of `Array` type that knows exactly how many elements it contains, and exactly which types it contains at specific positions.



```id
tstype StringNumberPair = [string, number];Try
```



Here, `StringNumberPair` is a tuple type of `string` and `number`.
Like `ReadonlyArray`, it has no representation at runtime, but is significant to TypeScript.
To the type system, `StringNumberPair` describes arrays whose `0` index contains a `string` and whose `1` index contains a `number`.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(pair: [string, number]) {  const a = pair[0];       const a: string  const b = pair[1];       const b: number  // ...} doSomething(["hello", 42]);Try
```



If we try to index past the number of elements, we’ll get an error.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(pair: [string, number]) {  // ...   const c = pair[2];Tuple type '[string, number]' of length '2' has no element at index '2'.2493Tuple type '[string, number]' of length '2' has no element at index '2'.}Try
```



We can also destructure tuples using JavaScript’s array destructuring.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(stringHash: [string, number]) {  const [inputString, hash] = stringHash;   console.log(inputString);                  const inputString: string   console.log(hash);               const hash: number}Try
```


 

Tuple types are useful in heavily convention-based APIs, where each element’s meaning is “obvious”.
This gives us flexibility in whatever we want to name our variables when we destructure them.
In the above example, we were able to name elements `0` and `1` to whatever we wanted.

However, since not every user holds the same view of what’s obvious, it may be worth reconsidering whether using objects with descriptive property names may be better for your API.

 

Other than those length checks, simple tuple types like these are equivalent to types which are versions of `Array`s that declare properties for specific indexes, and that declare `length` with a numeric literal type.



```id
tsinterface StringNumberPair {  // specialized properties  length: 2;  0: string;  1: number;   // Other &apos;Array<string | number>&apos; members...  ' >slice(start?: number, end?: number): ' >Array<string | number>;}Try
```



Another thing you may be interested in is that tuples can have optional properties by writing out a question mark (`?` after an element’s type).
Optional tuple elements can only come at the end, and also affect the type of `length`.



```id
tstype Either2dOr3d = [number, number, number?]; function setCoordinate(coord: Either2dOr3d) {  const [x, y, z] = coord;              const z: number | undefined   console.log(`Provided coordinates had ${coord.length} dimensions`);                                                  (property) length: 2 | 3}Try
```



Tuples can also have rest elements, which have to be an array/tuple type.



```id
tstype StringNumberBooleans = [string, number, ...boolean[]];type StringBooleansNumber = [string, ...boolean[], number];type BooleansStringNumber = [...boolean[], string, number];Try
```



 `StringNumberBooleans` describes a tuple whose first two elements are `string` and `number` respectively, but which may have any number of `boolean`s following.

- `StringBooleansNumber` describes a tuple whose first element is `string` and then any number of `boolean`s and ending with a `number`.

- `BooleansStringNumber` describes a tuple whose starting elements are any number of `boolean`s and ending with a `string` then a `number`.

A tuple with a rest element has no set “length” - it only has a set of well-known elements in different positions.



```id
tsconst a: StringNumberBooleans = ["hello", 1];const b: StringNumberBooleans = ["beautiful", 2, true];const c: StringNumberBooleans = ["world", 3, true, false, true, false, true];Try
```



Why might optional and rest elements be useful?
Well, it allows TypeScript to correspond tuples with parameter lists.
Tuples types can be used in rest parameters and arguments , so that the following:



```id
tsfunction readButtonInput(...args: [string, number, ...boolean[]]) {  const [name, version, ...input] = args;  // ...}Try
```



is basically equivalent to:



```id
tsfunction readButtonInput(name: string, version: number, ...input: boolean[]) {  // ...}Try
```



This is handy when you want to take a variable number of arguments with a rest parameter, and you need a minimum number of elements, but you don’t want to introduce intermediate variables.

 

### `readonly` Tuple Types

One final note about tuple types - tuple types have `readonly` variants, and can be specified by sticking a `readonly` modifier in front of them - just like with array shorthand syntax.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {  // ...}Try
```



As you might expect, writing to any property of a `readonly` tuple isn’t allowed in TypeScript.



```id
tsfunction doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {  pair[0] = "hello!";Cannot assign to '0' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to '0' because it is a read-only property.}Try
```



Tuples tend to be created and left un-modified in most code, so annotating types as `readonly` tuples when possible is a good default.
This is also important given that array literals with `const` assertions will be inferred with `readonly` tuple types.



```id
tslet point = [3, 4] as const; function distanceFromOrigin([x, y]: [number, number]) {  return Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2);} distanceFromOrigin(point);Argument of type 'readonly [3, 4]' is not assignable to parameter of type '[number, number]'.
  The type 'readonly [3, 4]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type '[number, number]'.2345Argument of type 'readonly [3, 4]' is not assignable to parameter of type '[number, number]'.
  The type 'readonly [3, 4]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type '[number, number]'.Try
```



Here, `distanceFromOrigin` never modifies its elements, but expects a mutable tuple.
Since `point`’s type was inferred as `readonly [3, 4]`, it won’t be compatible with `[number, number]` since that type can’t guarantee `point`’s elements won’t be mutated.

# Template Literal Types

 

Template literal types build on string literal types , and have the ability to expand into many strings via unions.

They have the same syntax as template literal strings in JavaScript , but are used in type positions.
When used with concrete literal types, a template literal produces a new string literal type by concatenating the contents.



```id
tstype World = "world"; type Greeting = `hello ${World}`;        type Greeting = "hello world"Try
```



When a union is used in the interpolated position, the type is the set of every possible string literal that could be represented by each union member:



```id
tstype EmailLocaleIDs = "welcome_email" | "email_heading";type FooterLocaleIDs = "footer_title" | "footer_sendoff"; type AllLocaleIDs = `${EmailLocaleIDs | FooterLocaleIDs}_id`;          type AllLocaleIDs = "welcome_email_id" | "email_heading_id" | "footer_title_id" | "footer_sendoff_id"Try
```



For each interpolated position in the template literal, the unions are cross multiplied:



```id
tstype AllLocaleIDs = `${EmailLocaleIDs | FooterLocaleIDs}_id`;type Lang = "en" | "ja" | "pt"; type LocaleMessageIDs = `${Lang}_${AllLocaleIDs}`;            type LocaleMessageIDs = "en_welcome_email_id" | "en_email_heading_id" | "en_footer_title_id" | "en_footer_sendoff_id" | "ja_welcome_email_id" | "ja_email_heading_id" | "ja_footer_title_id" | "ja_footer_sendoff_id" | "pt_welcome_email_id" | "pt_email_heading_id" | "pt_footer_title_id" | "pt_footer_sendoff_id"Try
```



We generally recommend that people use ahead-of-time generation for large string unions, but this is useful in smaller cases.

### String Unions in Types

The power in template literals comes when defining a new string based on information inside a type.

Consider the case where a function (`makeWatchedObject`) adds a new function
called `on()` to a passed object. In JavaScript, its call might look like:
`makeWatchedObject(baseObject)`. We can imagine the base object as looking
like:



```id
tsconst passedObject = {  firstName: "Saoirse",  lastName: "Ronan",  age: 26,};Try
```



The `on` function that will be added to the base object expects two arguments, an `eventName` (a `string`) and a `callback` (a `function`).

The `eventName` should be of the form `attributeInThePassedObject + "Changed"`; thus, `firstNameChanged` as derived from the attribute `firstName` in the base object.

The `callback` function, when called:

 Should be passed a value of the type associated with the name `attributeInThePassedObject`; thus, since `firstName` is typed as `string`, the callback for the `firstNameChanged` event expects a `string` to be passed to it at call time. Similarly events associated with `age` should expect to be called with a `number` argument

- Should have `void` return type (for simplicity of demonstration)

The naive function signature of `on()` might thus be: 

```
on(eventName: string, callback: (newValue: any) => void)
```

. However, in the preceding description, we identified important type constraints that we’d like to document in our code. Template Literal types let us bring these constraints into our code.



```id
tsconst person = makeWatchedObject({  firstName: "Saoirse",  lastName: "Ronan",  age: 26,}); // makeWatchedObject has added `on` to the anonymous Object person.on("firstNameChanged", (newValue) => {  console.log(`firstName was changed to ${newValue}!`);});Try
```



Notice that `on` listens on the event `"firstNameChanged"`, not just `"firstName"`. Our naive specification of `on()` could be made more robust if we were to ensure that the set of eligible event names was constrained by the union of attribute names in the watched object with “Changed” added at the end. While we are comfortable with doing such a calculation in JavaScript i.e. `Object.keys(passedObject).map(x => `${x}Changed`)`, template literals inside the type system provide a similar approach to string manipulation:



```id
tstype  = {
    on(eventName: `${string & keyof Type}Changed`, callback: (newValue: any) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<' >Type> = {     void): void' >on(eventName: `${string & keyof ' >Type}Changed`,  void' >callback: (newValue: any) => void): void;}; /// Create a "watched object" with an `on` method/// so that you can watch for changes to properties.declare function (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >makeWatchedObject<(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type>(obj: (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type): (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type &  = {
    on(eventName: `${string & keyof Type}Changed`, callback: (newValue: any) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type>;Try
```



With this, we can build something that errors when given the wrong property:



```id
tsconst ' >person = (obj: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}): {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
} & PropEventSource<{
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}>' >makeWatchedObject({  firstName: "Saoirse",  lastName: "Ronan",  age: 26}); ' >person. void): void' >on("firstNameChanged", () => {}); // Prevent easy human error (using the key instead of the event name)' >person. void): void' >on("firstName", () => {});Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'.2345Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'. // It&apos;s typo-resistant' >person. void): void' >on("frstNameChanged", () => {});Argument of type '"frstNameChanged"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'.2345Argument of type '"frstNameChanged"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'.Try
```



### Inference with Template Literals

Notice that we did not benefit from all the information provided in the original passed object. Given change of a `firstName` (i.e. a `firstNameChanged` event), we should expect that the callback will receive an argument of type `string`. Similarly, the callback for a change to `age` should receive a `number` argument. We’re naively using `any` to type the `callback`’s argument. Again, template literal types make it possible to ensure an attribute’s data type will be the same type as that attribute’s callback’s first argument.

The key insight that makes this possible is this: we can use a function with a generic such that:

- The literal used in the first argument is captured as a literal type

- That literal type can be validated as being in the union of valid attributes in the generic

- The type of the validated attribute can be looked up in the generic’s structure using Indexed Access

- This typing information can then be applied to ensure the argument to the
callback function is of the same type



```id
tstype  = {
    on<Key extends string & keyof Type>(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<' >Type> = {    (eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void' >on<(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void' >Key extends string & keyof ' >Type>        (eventName: `${(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void' >Key}Changed`,  void' >callback: (newValue: ' >Type[(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void' >Key]) => void): void;}; declare function (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >makeWatchedObject<(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type>(obj: (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type): (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type &  = {
    on<Key extends string & keyof Type>(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type>; const ' >person = (obj: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}): {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
} & PropEventSource<{
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}>' >makeWatchedObject({  firstName: "Saoirse",  lastName: "Ronan",  age: 26}); ' >person.(eventName: "firstNameChanged", callback: (newValue: string) => void): void' >on("firstNameChanged", newName => {                                (parameter) newName: string    console.log(`new name is ${newName.toUpperCase()}`);}); ' >person.(eventName: "ageChanged", callback: (newValue: number) => void): void' >on("ageChanged", newAge => {                          (parameter) newAge: number    if (newAge < 0) {        console.warn("warning! negative age");    }})Try
```



Here we made `on` into a generic method.

When a user calls with the string `"firstNameChanged"`, TypeScript will try to infer the right type for `Key`.
To do that, it will match `Key` against the content before `"Changed"` and infer the string `"firstName"`.
Once TypeScript figures that out, the `on` method can fetch the type of `firstName` on the original object, which is `string` in this case.
Similarly, when called with `"ageChanged"`, TypeScript finds the type for the property `age` which is `number`.

Inference can be combined in different ways, often to deconstruct strings, and reconstruct them in different ways.

## Intrinsic String Manipulation Types

To help with string manipulation, TypeScript includes a set of types which can be used in string manipulation. These types come built-in to the compiler for performance and can’t be found in the `.d.ts` files included with TypeScript.

### `Uppercase `

Converts each character in the string to the uppercase version.

 Example 


```id
tstype Greeting = "Hello, world"type ShoutyGreeting =  = intrinsic' >Uppercase<Greeting>           type ShoutyGreeting = "HELLO, WORLD" type  = `ID-${Uppercase<Str>}`' >ASCIICacheKey<' >Str extends string> = `ID-${ = intrinsic' >Uppercase<' >Str>}`type MainID =  = `ID-${Uppercase<Str>}`' >ASCIICacheKey<"my_app">       type MainID = "ID-MY_APP"Try
```



### `Lowercase `

Converts each character in the string to the lowercase equivalent.

 Example 


```id
tstype Greeting = "Hello, world"type QuietGreeting =  = intrinsic' >Lowercase<Greeting>          type QuietGreeting = "hello, world" type  = `id-${Lowercase<Str>}`' >ASCIICacheKey<' >Str extends string> = `id-${ = intrinsic' >Lowercase<' >Str>}`type MainID =  = `id-${Lowercase<Str>}`' >ASCIICacheKey<"MY_APP">       type MainID = "id-my_app"Try
```



### `Capitalize `

Converts the first character in the string to an uppercase equivalent.

 Example 


```id
tstype LowercaseGreeting = "hello, world";type Greeting =  = intrinsic' >Capitalize<LowercaseGreeting>;        type Greeting = "Hello, world"Try
```



### `Uncapitalize `

Converts the first character in the string to a lowercase equivalent.

 Example 


```id
tstype UppercaseGreeting = "HELLO WORLD";type UncomfortableGreeting =  = intrinsic' >Uncapitalize<UppercaseGreeting>;              type UncomfortableGreeting = "hELLO WORLD"Try
```


 
 Technical details on the intrinsic string manipulation types 
 

The code, as of TypeScript 4.1, for these intrinsic functions uses the JavaScript string runtime functions directly for manipulation and are not locale aware.

 `

```
function applyStringMapping(symbol: Symbol, str: string) {
    switch (intrinsicTypeKinds.get(symbol.escapedName as string)) {
        case IntrinsicTypeKind.Uppercase: return str.toUpperCase();
        case IntrinsicTypeKind.Lowercase: return str.toLowerCase();
        case IntrinsicTypeKind.Capitalize: return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
        case IntrinsicTypeKind.Uncapitalize: return str.charAt(0).toLowerCase() + str.slice(1);
    }
    return str;
}
```

`

# Creating Types from Types

 

TypeScript’s type system is very powerful because it allows expressing types in terms of other types .

The simplest form of this idea is generics. Additionally, we have a wide variety of type operators available to use.
It’s also possible to express types in terms of values that we already have.

By combining various type operators, we can express complex operations and values in a succinct, maintainable way.
In this section we’ll cover ways to express a new type in terms of an existing type or value.

 Generics - Types which take parameters

- Keyof Type Operator - Using the `keyof` operator to create new types

- Typeof Type Operator - Using the `typeof` operator to create new types

- Indexed Access Types - Using `Type['a']` syntax to access a subset of a type

- Conditional Types - Types which act like if statements in the type system

- Mapped Types - Creating types by mapping each property in an existing type

- Template Literal Types - Mapped types which change properties via template literal strings

### TypeScript: Documentation - Classes

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - Classes 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Classes

 
 

Background Reading:
 Classes (MDN) 


 

TypeScript offers full support for the `class` keyword introduced in ES2015.

As with other JavaScript language features, TypeScript adds type annotations and other syntax to allow you to express relationships between classes and other types.

## Class Members

Here’s the most basic class - an empty one:



```id
tsclass Point {}Try
```



This class isn’t very useful yet, so let’s start adding some members.

### Fields

A field declaration creates a public writeable property on a class:



```id
tsclass Point {  x: number;  y: number;} const pt = new Point();pt.x = 0;pt.y = 0;Try
```



As with other locations, the type annotation is optional, but will be an implicit `any` if not specified.

Fields can also have initializers ; these will run automatically when the class is instantiated:



```id
tsclass Point {  x = 0;  y = 0;} const pt = new Point();// Prints 0, 0console.log(`${pt.x}, ${pt.y}`);Try
```



Just like with `const`, `let`, and `var`, the initializer of a class property will be used to infer its type:



```id
tsconst pt = new Point();pt.x = "0";Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.Try
```



#### `--strictPropertyInitialization`

The `strictPropertyInitialization` setting controls whether class fields need to be initialized in the constructor.



```id
tsclass BadGreeter {  name: string;Property 'name' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.2564Property 'name' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.}Try
```




```id
tsclass GoodGreeter {  name: string;   constructor() {    this.name = "hello";  }}Try
```



Note that the field needs to be initialized in the constructor itself .
TypeScript does not analyze methods you invoke from the constructor to detect initializations, because a derived class might override those methods and fail to initialize the members.

If you intend to definitely initialize a field through means other than the constructor (for example, maybe an external library is filling in part of your class for you), you can use the definite assignment assertion operator , `!`:



```id
tsclass OKGreeter {  // Not initialized, but no error  name!: string;}Try
```



### `readonly`

Fields may be prefixed with the `readonly` modifier.
This prevents assignments to the field outside of the constructor.



```id
tsclass Greeter {  readonly name: string = "world";   constructor(otherName?: string) {    if (otherName !== undefined) {      this.name = otherName;    }  }   err() {    this.name = "not ok";Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.  }}const g = new Greeter();g.name = "also not ok";Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.Try
```



### Constructors

 
 

Background Reading:

 Constructor (MDN) 

 


 

Class constructors are very similar to functions.
You can add parameters with type annotations, default values, and overloads:



```id
tsclass Point {  x: number;  y: number;   // Normal signature with defaults  constructor(x = 0, y = 0) {    this.x = x;    this.y = y;  }}Try
```




```id
tsclass Point {  x: number = 0;  y: number = 0;   // Constructor overloads  constructor(x: number, y: number);  constructor(xy: string);  constructor(x: string | number, y: number = 0) {    // Code logic here  }}Try
```



There are just a few differences between class constructor signatures and function signatures:

 Constructors can’t have type parameters - these belong on the outer class declaration, which we’ll learn about later

- Constructors can’t have return type annotations - the class instance type is always what’s returned

#### Super Calls

Just as in JavaScript, if you have a base class, you’ll need to call `super();` in your constructor body before using any `this.` members:



```id
tsclass Base {  k = 4;} class Derived extends Base {  constructor() {    // Prints a wrong value in ES5; throws exception in ES6    console.log(this.k);'super' must be called before accessing 'this' in the constructor of a derived class.17009'super' must be called before accessing 'this' in the constructor of a derived class.    super();  }}Try
```



Forgetting to call `super` is an easy mistake to make in JavaScript, but TypeScript will tell you when it’s necessary.

### Methods

 
 

Background Reading:

 Method definitions 

 


 

A function property on a class is called a method .
Methods can use all the same type annotations as functions and constructors:



```id
tsclass Point {  x = 10;  y = 10;   scale(n: number): void {    this.x *= n;    this.y *= n;  }}Try
```



Other than the standard type annotations, TypeScript doesn’t add anything else new to methods.

Note that inside a method body, it is still mandatory to access fields and other methods via `this.`.
An unqualified name in a method body will always refer to something in the enclosing scope:



```id
tslet x: number = 0; class C {  x: string = "hello";   m() {    // This is trying to modify &apos;x&apos; from line 1, not the class property    x = "world";Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.  }}Try
```



### Getters / Setters

Classes can also have accessors :



```id
tsclass C {  _length = 0;  get length() {    return this._length;  }  set length(value) {    this._length = value;  }}Try
```


 

Note that a field-backed get/set pair with no extra logic is very rarely useful in JavaScript.
It’s fine to expose public fields if you don’t need to add additional logic during the get/set operations.

 

TypeScript has some special inference rules for accessors:

- If `get` exists but no `set`, the property is automatically `readonly`

- If the type of the setter parameter is not specified, it is inferred from the return type of the getter

Since TypeScript 4.3 , it is possible to have accessors with different types for getting and setting.



```id
tsclass Thing {  _size = 0;   get size(): number {    return this._size;  }   set size(value: string | number | boolean) {    let num =  number' >Number(value);     // Don&apos;t allow NaN, Infinity, etc     if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {      this._size = 0;      return;    }     this._size = num;  }}Try
```



### Index Signatures

Classes can declare index signatures; these work the same as Index Signatures for other object types :



```id
tsclass MyClass {  [s: string]: boolean | ((s: string) => boolean);   check(s: string) {    return this[s] as boolean;  }}Try
```



Because the index signature type needs to also capture the types of methods, it’s not easy to usefully use these types.
Generally it’s better to store indexed data in another place instead of on the class instance itself.

## Class Heritage

Like other languages with object-oriented features, classes in JavaScript can inherit from base classes.

### `implements` Clauses

You can use an `implements` clause to check that a class satisfies a particular `interface`.
An error will be issued if a class fails to correctly implement it:



```id
tsinterface Pingable {  ping(): void;} class Sonar implements Pingable {  ping() {    console.log("ping!");  }} class Ball implements Pingable {Class 'Ball' incorrectly implements interface 'Pingable'.
  Property 'ping' is missing in type 'Ball' but required in type 'Pingable'.2420Class 'Ball' incorrectly implements interface 'Pingable'.
  Property 'ping' is missing in type 'Ball' but required in type 'Pingable'.  pong() {    console.log("pong!");  }}Try
```



Classes may also implement multiple interfaces, e.g. `class C implements A, B {`.

#### Cautions

It’s important to understand that an `implements` clause is only a check that the class can be treated as the interface type.
It doesn’t change the type of the class or its methods at all .
A common source of error is to assume that an `implements` clause will change the class type - it doesn’t!



```id
tsinterface Checkable {  check(name: string): boolean;} class NameChecker implements Checkable {  check(s) {Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type.7006Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type.    // Notice no error here    return s.toLowerCase() === "ok";                 any  }}Try
```



In this example, we perhaps expected that `s`’s type would be influenced by the `name: string` parameter of `check`.
It is not - `implements` clauses don’t change how the class body is checked or its type inferred.

Similarly, implementing an interface with an optional property doesn’t create that property:



```id
tsinterface A {  x: number;  y?: number;}class C implements A {  x = 0;}const c = new C();c.y = 10;Property 'y' does not exist on type 'C'.2339Property 'y' does not exist on type 'C'.Try
```



### `extends` Clauses

 
 

Background Reading:

 extends keyword (MDN) 

 


 

Classes may `extend` from a base class.
A derived class has all the properties and methods of its base class, and can also define additional members.



```id
tsclass Animal {  move() {    console.log("Moving along!");  }} class Dog extends Animal {  woof(times: number) {    for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {      console.log("woof!");    }  }} const d = new Dog();// Base class methodd.move();// Derived class methodd.woof(3);Try
```



#### Overriding Methods

 
 

Background Reading:

 super keyword (MDN) 

 


 

A derived class can also override a base class field or property.
You can use the `super.` syntax to access base class methods.
Note that because JavaScript classes are a simple lookup object, there is no notion of a “super field”.

TypeScript enforces that a derived class is always a subtype of its base class.

For example, here’s a legal way to override a method:



```id
tsclass Base {  greet() {    console.log("Hello, world!");  }} class Derived extends Base {  greet(name?: string) {    if (name === undefined) {      super.greet();    } else {      console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);    }  }} const d = new Derived();d.greet();d.greet("reader");Try
```



It’s important that a derived class follow its base class contract.
Remember that it’s very common (and always legal!) to refer to a derived class instance through a base class reference:



```id
ts// Alias the derived instance through a base class referenceconst b: Base = d;// No problemb.greet();Try
```



What if `Derived` didn’t follow `Base`’s contract?



```id
tsclass Base {  greet() {    console.log("Hello, world!");  }} class Derived extends Base {  // Make this parameter required  greet(name: string) {Property 'greet' in type 'Derived' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'Base'.
  Type '(name: string) => void' is not assignable to type '() => void'.
    Target signature provides too few arguments. Expected 1 or more, but got 0.2416Property 'greet' in type 'Derived' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'Base'.
  Type '(name: string) => void' is not assignable to type '() => void'.
    Target signature provides too few arguments. Expected 1 or more, but got 0.    console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);  }}Try
```



If we compiled this code despite the error, this sample would then crash:



```id
tsconst b: Base = new Derived();// Crashes because "name" will be undefinedb.greet();Try
```



#### Type-only Field Declarations

When `target >= ES2022` or `useDefineForClassFields` is `true`, class fields are initialized after the parent class constructor completes, overwriting any value set by the parent class. This can be a problem when you only want to re-declare a more accurate type for an inherited field. To handle these cases, you can write `declare` to indicate to TypeScript that there should be no runtime effect for this field declaration.



```id
tsinterface Animal {  dateOfBirth: any;} interface Dog extends Animal {  breed: any;} class AnimalHouse {  resident: Animal;  constructor(animal: Animal) {    this.resident = animal;  }} class DogHouse extends AnimalHouse {  // Does not emit JavaScript code,  // only ensures the types are correct  declare resident: Dog;  constructor(dog: Dog) {    super(dog);  }}Try
```



#### Initialization Order

The order that JavaScript classes initialize can be surprising in some cases.
Let’s consider this code:



```id
tsclass Base {  name = "base";  constructor() {    console.log("My name is " + this.name);  }} class Derived extends Base {  name = "derived";} // Prints "base", not "derived"const d = new Derived();Try
```



What happened here?

The order of class initialization, as defined by JavaScript, is:

- The base class fields are initialized

- The base class constructor runs

- The derived class fields are initialized

- The derived class constructor runs

This means that the base class constructor saw its own value for `name` during its own constructor, because the derived class field initializations hadn’t run yet.

#### Inheriting Built-in Types

 

Note: If you don’t plan to inherit from built-in types like `Array`, `Error`, `Map`, etc. or your compilation target is explicitly set to `ES6`/`ES2015` or above, you may skip this section

 

In ES2015, constructors which return an object implicitly substitute the value of `this` for any callers of `super(...)`.
It is necessary for generated constructor code to capture any potential return value of `super(...)` and replace it with `this`.

As a result, subclassing `Error`, `Array`, and others may no longer work as expected.
This is due to the fact that constructor functions for `Error`, `Array`, and the like use ECMAScript 6’s `new.target` to adjust the prototype chain;
however, there is no way to ensure a value for `new.target` when invoking a constructor in ECMAScript 5.
Other downlevel compilers generally have the same limitation by default.

For a subclass like the following:



```id
tsclass MsgError extends Error {  constructor(m: string) {    super(m);  }  sayHello() {    return "hello " + this.message;  }}Try
```



you may find that:

- methods may be `undefined` on objects returned by constructing these subclasses, so calling `sayHello` will result in an error.

- `instanceof` will be broken between instances of the subclass and their instances, so `(new MsgError()) instanceof MsgError` will return `false`.

As a recommendation, you can manually adjust the prototype immediately after any `super(...)` calls.



```id
tsclass MsgError extends Error {  constructor(m: string) {    super(m);     // Set the prototype explicitly.    Object.setPrototypeOf(this, MsgError.prototype);  }   sayHello() {    return "hello " + this.message;  }}Try
```



However, any subclass of `MsgError` will have to manually set the prototype as well.
For runtimes that don’t support `Object.setPrototypeOf` , you may instead be able to use `__proto__` .

Unfortunately, these workarounds will not work on Internet Explorer 10 and prior .
One can manually copy methods from the prototype onto the instance itself (i.e. `MsgError.prototype` onto `this`), but the prototype chain itself cannot be fixed.

## Member Visibility

You can use TypeScript to control whether certain methods or properties are visible to code outside the class.

### `public`

The default visibility of class members is `public`.
A `public` member can be accessed anywhere:



```id
tsclass Greeter {  public greet() {    console.log("hi!");  }}const g = new Greeter();g.greet();Try
```



Because `public` is already the default visibility modifier, you don’t ever need to write it on a class member, but might choose to do so for style/readability reasons.

### `protected`

`protected` members are only visible to subclasses of the class they’re declared in.



```id
tsclass Greeter {  public greet() {    console.log("Hello, " + this.getName());  }  protected getName() {    return "hi";  }} class SpecialGreeter extends Greeter {  public howdy() {    // OK to access protected member here    console.log("Howdy, " + this.getName());  }}const g = new SpecialGreeter();g.greet(); // OKg.getName();Property 'getName' is protected and only accessible within class 'Greeter' and its subclasses.2445Property 'getName' is protected and only accessible within class 'Greeter' and its subclasses.Try
```



#### Exposure of `protected` members

Derived classes need to follow their base class contracts, but may choose to expose a subtype of base class with more capabilities.
This includes making `protected` members `public`:



```id
tsclass Base {  protected m = 10;}class Derived extends Base {  // No modifier, so default is &apos;public&apos;  m = 15;}const d = new Derived();console.log(d.m); // OKTry
```



Note that `Derived` was already able to freely read and write `m`, so this doesn’t meaningfully alter the “security” of this situation.
The main thing to note here is that in the derived class, we need to be careful to repeat the `protected` modifier if this exposure isn’t intentional.

#### Cross-hierarchy `protected` access

TypeScript doesn’t allow accessing `protected` members of a sibling class in a class hierarchy:



```id
tsclass Base {  protected x: number = 1;}class Derived1 extends Base {  protected x: number = 5;}class Derived2 extends Base {  f1(other: Derived2) {    other.x = 10;  }  f2(other: Derived1) {    other.x = 10;Property 'x' is protected and only accessible within class 'Derived1' and its subclasses.2445Property 'x' is protected and only accessible within class 'Derived1' and its subclasses.  }}Try
```



This is because accessing `x` in `Derived2` should only be legal from `Derived2`’s subclasses, and `Derived1` isn’t one of them.
Moreover, if accessing `x` through a `Derived1` reference is illegal (which it certainly should be!), then accessing it through a base class reference should never improve the situation.

See also Why Can’t I Access A Protected Member From A Derived Class? which explains more of C#‘s reasoning on the same topic.

### `private`

`private` is like `protected`, but doesn’t allow access to the member even from subclasses:



```id
tsclass Base {  private x = 0;}const b = new Base();// Can&apos;t access from outside the classconsole.log(b.x);Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.2341Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.Try
```




```id
tsclass Derived extends Base {  showX() {    // Can&apos;t access in subclasses    console.log(this.x);Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.2341Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.  }}Try
```



Because `private` members aren’t visible to derived classes, a derived class can’t increase their visibility:



```id
tsclass Base {  private x = 0;}class Derived extends Base {Class 'Derived' incorrectly extends base class 'Base'.
  Property 'x' is private in type 'Base' but not in type 'Derived'.2415Class 'Derived' incorrectly extends base class 'Base'.
  Property 'x' is private in type 'Base' but not in type 'Derived'.  x = 1;}Try
```



#### Cross-instance `private` access

Different OOP languages disagree about whether different instances of the same class may access each others’ `private` members.
While languages like Java, C#, C++, Swift, and PHP allow this, Ruby does not.

TypeScript does allow cross-instance `private` access:



```id
tsclass A {  private x = 10;   public sameAs(other: A) {    // No error    return other.x === this.x;  }}Try
```



#### Caveats

Like other aspects of TypeScript’s type system, `private` and `protected` are only enforced during type checking .

This means that JavaScript runtime constructs like `in` or simple property lookup can still access a `private` or `protected` member:



```id
tsclass MySafe {  private secretKey = 12345;}Try
```




```id
js// In a JavaScript file...const s = new MySafe();// Will print 12345console.log(s.secretKey);
```



`private` also allows access using bracket notation during type checking. This makes `private`-declared fields potentially easier to access for things like unit tests, with the drawback that these fields are soft private and don’t strictly enforce privacy.



```id
tsclass MySafe {  private secretKey = 12345;} const s = new MySafe(); // Not allowed during type checkingconsole.log(s.secretKey);Property 'secretKey' is private and only accessible within class 'MySafe'.2341Property 'secretKey' is private and only accessible within class 'MySafe'. // OKconsole.log(s["secretKey"]);Try
```



Unlike TypeScripts’s `private`, JavaScript’s private fields (`#`) remain private after compilation and do not provide the previously mentioned escape hatches like bracket notation access, making them hard private .



```id
tsclass Dog {  #barkAmount = 0;  personality = "happy";   constructor() {}}Try
```




```id
ts"use strict";class Dog {    #barkAmount = 0;    personality = "happy";    constructor() { }} Try
```



When compiling to ES2021 or less, TypeScript will use WeakMaps in place of `#`.



```id
ts"use strict";var _Dog_barkAmount;class Dog {    constructor() {        _Dog_barkAmount.set(this, 0);        this.personality = "happy";    }}_Dog_barkAmount = new WeakMap(); Try
```



If you need to protect values in your class from malicious actors, you should use mechanisms that offer hard runtime privacy, such as closures, WeakMaps, or private fields. Note that these added privacy checks during runtime could affect performance.

## Static Members

 
 

Background Reading:

 Static Members (MDN) 

 


 

Classes may have `static` members.
These members aren’t associated with a particular instance of the class.
They can be accessed through the class constructor object itself:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  static x = 0;  static printX() {    console.log(MyClass.x);  }}console.log(MyClass.x);MyClass.printX();Try
```



Static members can also use the same `public`, `protected`, and `private` visibility modifiers:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  private static x = 0;}console.log(MyClass.x);Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'MyClass'.2341Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'MyClass'.Try
```



Static members are also inherited:



```id
tsclass Base {  static getGreeting() {    return "Hello world";  }}class Derived extends Base {  myGreeting = Derived.getGreeting();}Try
```



### Special Static Names

It’s generally not safe/possible to overwrite properties from the `Function` prototype.
Because classes are themselves functions that can be invoked with `new`, certain `static` names can’t be used.
Function properties like `name`, `length`, and `call` aren’t valid to define as `static` members:



```id
tsclass S {  static name = "S!";Static property 'name' conflicts with built-in property 'Function.name' of constructor function 'S'.2699Static property 'name' conflicts with built-in property 'Function.name' of constructor function 'S'.}Try
```



### Why No Static Classes?

TypeScript (and JavaScript) don’t have a construct called `static class` the same way as, for example, C# does.

Those constructs only exist because those languages force all data and functions to be inside a class; because that restriction doesn’t exist in TypeScript, there’s no need for them.
A class with only a single instance is typically just represented as a normal object in JavaScript/TypeScript.

For example, we don’t need a “static class” syntax in TypeScript because a regular object (or even top-level function) will do the job just as well:



```id
ts// Unnecessary "static" classclass MyStaticClass {  static doSomething() {}} // Preferred (alternative 1)function doSomething() {} // Preferred (alternative 2)const MyHelperObject = {  dosomething() {},};Try
```



## `static` Blocks in Classes

Static blocks allow you to write a sequence of statements with their own scope that can access private fields within the containing class. This means that we can write initialization code with all the capabilities of writing statements, no leakage of variables, and full access to our class’s internals.



```id
tsclass Foo {    static #count = 0;     get count() {        return Foo.#count;    }     static {        try {            const lastInstances = loadLastInstances();            Foo.#count += lastInstances..length: number' >length;        }        catch {}    }}Try
```



## Generic Classes

Classes, much like interfaces, can be generic.
When a generic class is instantiated with `new`, its type parameters are inferred the same way as in a function call:



```id
tsclass ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;  constructor(value: ' >Type) {    this..contents: Type' >contents = value;  }} const ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>b = new (value: string): Box<string>' >Box("hello!");     const b: Box<string>Try
```



Classes can use generic constraints and defaults the same way as interfaces.

### Type Parameters in Static Members

This code isn’t legal, and it may not be obvious why:



```id
tsclass ' >Box<' >Type> {  static .defaultValue: Type' >defaultValue: Type;Static members cannot reference class type parameters.2302Static members cannot reference class type parameters.}Try
```



Remember that types are always fully erased!
At runtime, there’s only one `Box.defaultValue` property slot.
This means that setting `Box .defaultValue` (if that were possible) would also change `Box .defaultValue` - not good.
The `static` members of a generic class can never refer to the class’s type parameters.

## `this` at Runtime in Classes

 
 

Background Reading:

 this keyword (MDN) 

 


 

It’s important to remember that TypeScript doesn’t change the runtime behavior of JavaScript, and that JavaScript is somewhat famous for having some peculiar runtime behaviors.

JavaScript’s handling of `this` is indeed unusual:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  name = "MyClass";  getName() {    return this.name;  }}const c = new MyClass();const  string;
}' >obj = {  name: "obj",   string' >getName: c.getName,}; // Prints "obj", not "MyClass"console.log( string;
}' >obj. string' >getName());Try
```



Long story short, by default, the value of `this` inside a function depends on how the function was called .
In this example, because the function was called through the `obj` reference, its value of `this` was `obj` rather than the class instance.

This is rarely what you want to happen!
TypeScript provides some ways to mitigate or prevent this kind of error.

### Arrow Functions

 
 

Background Reading:

 Arrow functions (MDN) 

 


 

If you have a function that will often be called in a way that loses its `this` context, it can make sense to use an arrow function property instead of a method definition:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  name = "MyClass";   string' >getName = () => {    return this.name;  };}const c = new MyClass();const  string' >g = c. string' >getName;// Prints "MyClass" instead of crashingconsole.log( string' >g());Try
```



This has some trade-offs:

- The `this` value is guaranteed to be correct at runtime, even for code not checked with TypeScript

- This will use more memory, because each class instance will have its own copy of each function defined this way

- You can’t use `super.getName` in a derived class, because there’s no entry in the prototype chain to fetch the base class method from

### `this` parameters

In a method or function definition, an initial parameter named `this` has special meaning in TypeScript.
These parameters are erased during compilation:



```id
ts// TypeScript input with &apos;this&apos; parameterfunction fn(this: SomeType, x: number) {  /* ... */}Try
```




```id
js// JavaScript outputfunction fn(x) {  /* ... */}
```



TypeScript checks that calling a function with a `this` parameter is done so with a correct context.
Instead of using an arrow function, we can add a `this` parameter to method definitions to statically enforce that the method is called correctly:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  name = "MyClass";  getName(this: MyClass) {    return this.name;  }}const c = new MyClass();// OKc.getName(); // Error, would crashconst  string' >g = c.getName;console.log( string' >g());The 'this' context of type 'void' is not assignable to method's 'this' of type 'MyClass'.2684The 'this' context of type 'void' is not assignable to method's 'this' of type 'MyClass'.Try
```



This method makes the opposite trade-offs of the arrow function approach:

- JavaScript callers might still use the class method incorrectly without realizing it

- Only one function per class definition gets allocated, rather than one per class instance

- Base method definitions can still be called via `super`.

## `this` Types

In classes, a special type called `this` refers dynamically to the type of the current class.
Let’s see how this is useful:

 


```id
tsclass Box {  contents: string = "";  set(value: string) {  (method) Box.set(value: string): this    this.contents = value;    return this;  }}Try
```



Here, TypeScript inferred the return type of `set` to be `this`, rather than `Box`.
Now let’s make a subclass of `Box`:



```id
tsclass ClearableBox extends Box {  clear() {    this.contents = "";  }} const a = new ClearableBox();const b = a.set("hello");     const b: ClearableBoxTry
```



You can also use `this` in a parameter type annotation:



```id
tsclass Box {  content: string = "";  sameAs(other: this) {    return other.content === this.content;  }}Try
```



This is different from writing `other: Box` — if you have a derived class, its `sameAs` method will now only accept other instances of that same derived class:



```id
tsclass Box {  content: string = "";  sameAs(other: this) {    return other.content === this.content;  }} class DerivedBox extends Box {  otherContent: string = "?";} const base = new Box();const derived = new DerivedBox();derived.sameAs(base);Argument of type 'Box' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DerivedBox'.
  Property 'otherContent' is missing in type 'Box' but required in type 'DerivedBox'.2345Argument of type 'Box' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DerivedBox'.
  Property 'otherContent' is missing in type 'Box' but required in type 'DerivedBox'.Try
```



### `this`-based type guards

You can use `this is Type` in the return position for methods in classes and interfaces.
When mixed with a type narrowing (e.g. `if` statements) the type of the target object would be narrowed to the specified `Type`.

 


```id
tsclass FileSystemObject {  isFile(): this is FileRep {    return this instanceof FileRep;  }  isDirectory(): this is Directory {    return this instanceof Directory;  }  isNetworked(): this is Networked & this {    return this.networked;  }  constructor(public path: string, private networked: boolean) {}} class FileRep extends FileSystemObject {  constructor(path: string, public content: string) {    super(path, false);  }} class Directory extends FileSystemObject {  children: FileSystemObject[];} interface Networked {  host: string;} const fso: FileSystemObject = new FileRep("foo/bar.txt", "foo"); if (fso.isFile()) {  fso.content;  const fso: FileRep} else if (fso.isDirectory()) {  fso.children;  const fso: Directory} else if (fso.isNetworked()) {  fso.host;  const fso: Networked & FileSystemObject}Try
```



A common use-case for a this-based type guard is to allow for lazy validation of a particular field. For example, this case removes an `undefined` from the value held inside box when `hasValue` has been verified to be true:



```id
tsclass ' >Box<' >T> {  .value?: T | undefined' >value?: ' >T;   .hasValue(): this is {
    value: T;
}' >hasValue(): this is { value: ' >T } {    return this..value?: T | undefined' >value !== undefined;  }} const ' >box = new (): Box<string>' >Box<string>();' >box..value?: string | undefined' >value = "Gameboy"; ' >box..value?: string' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>value;     (property) Box<string>.value?: string if (' >box..hasValue(): this is {
    value: string;
}' >hasValue()) {   & {
    value: string;
}' >box.value;       (property) value: string}Try
```



## Parameter Properties

TypeScript offers special syntax for turning a constructor parameter into a class property with the same name and value.
These are called parameter properties and are created by prefixing a constructor argument with one of the visibility modifiers `public`, `private`, `protected`, or `readonly`.
The resulting field gets those modifier(s):



```id
tsclass Params {  constructor(    public readonly x: number,    protected y: number,    private z: number  ) {    // No body necessary  }}const a = new Params(1, 2, 3);console.log(a.x);             (property) Params.x: numberconsole.log(a.z);Property 'z' is private and only accessible within class 'Params'.2341Property 'z' is private and only accessible within class 'Params'.Try
```



## Class Expressions

 
 

Background Reading:

 Class expressions (MDN) 

 


 

Class expressions are very similar to class declarations.
The only real difference is that class expressions don’t need a name, though we can refer to them via whatever identifier they ended up bound to:



```id
tsconst someClass = class<' >Type> {  .content: Type' >content: ' >Type;  constructor(value: ' >Type) {    this..content: Type' >content = value;  }}; const ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>m = new (value: string) => someClass<string>' >someClass("Hello, world");     const m: someClass<string>Try
```



## Constructor Signatures

JavaScript classes are instantiated with the `new` operator. Given the type of a class itself, the InstanceType utility type models this operation.



```id
tsclass Point {  createdAt: number;  x: number;  y: number  constructor(x: number, y: number) {    this.createdAt = Date.now()    this.x = x;    this.y = y;  }}type PointInstance =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >InstanceType<typeof Point> function moveRight(point: PointInstance) {  point.x += 5;} const point = new Point(3, 4);moveRight(point);point.x; // => 8Try
```



## `abstract` Classes and Members

Classes, methods, and fields in TypeScript may be abstract .

An abstract method or abstract field is one that hasn’t had an implementation provided.
These members must exist inside an abstract class , which cannot be directly instantiated.

The role of abstract classes is to serve as a base class for subclasses which do implement all the abstract members.
When a class doesn’t have any abstract members, it is said to be concrete .

Let’s look at an example:



```id
tsabstract class Base {  abstract getName(): string;   printName() {    console.log("Hello, " + this.getName());  }} const b = new Base();Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.2511Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.Try
```



We can’t instantiate `Base` with `new` because it’s abstract.
Instead, we need to make a derived class and implement the abstract members:



```id
tsclass Derived extends Base {  getName() {    return "world";  }} const d = new Derived();d.printName();Try
```



Notice that if we forget to implement the base class’s abstract members, we’ll get an error:



```id
tsclass Derived extends Base {Non-abstract class 'Derived' does not implement inherited abstract member getName from class 'Base'.2515Non-abstract class 'Derived' does not implement inherited abstract member getName from class 'Base'.  // forgot to do anything}Try
```



### Abstract Construct Signatures

Sometimes you want to accept some class constructor function that produces an instance of a class which derives from some abstract class.

For example, you might want to write this code:



```id
tsfunction greet(ctor: typeof Base) {  const instance = new  Base' >ctor();Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.2511Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.  instance.printName();}Try
```



TypeScript is correctly telling you that you’re trying to instantiate an abstract class.
After all, given the definition of `greet`, it’s perfectly legal to write this code, which would end up constructing an abstract class:



```id
ts// Bad!greet(Base);Try
```



Instead, you want to write a function that accepts something with a construct signature:



```id
tsfunction  Base): void' >greet( Base' >ctor: new () => Base) {  const instance = new  Base' >ctor();  instance.printName();} Base): void' >greet(Derived); Base): void' >greet(Base);Argument of type 'typeof Base' is not assignable to parameter of type 'new () => Base'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.2345Argument of type 'typeof Base' is not assignable to parameter of type 'new () => Base'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.Try
```



Now TypeScript correctly tells you about which class constructor functions can be invoked - `Derived` can because it’s concrete, but `Base` cannot.

## Relationships Between Classes

In most cases, classes in TypeScript are compared structurally, the same as other types.

For example, these two classes can be used in place of each other because they’re identical:



```id
tsclass Point1 {  x = 0;  y = 0;} class Point2 {  x = 0;  y = 0;} // OKconst p: Point1 = new Point2();Try
```



Similarly, subtype relationships between classes exist even if there’s no explicit inheritance:



```id
tsclass Person {  name: string;  age: number;} class Employee {  name: string;  age: number;  salary: number;} // OKconst p: Person = new Employee();Try
```



This sounds straightforward, but there are a few cases that seem stranger than others.

Empty classes have no members.
In a structural type system, a type with no members is generally a supertype of anything else.
So if you write an empty class (don’t!), anything can be used in place of it:



```id
tsclass Empty {} function fn(x: Empty) {  // can&apos;t do anything with &apos;x&apos;, so I won&apos;t} // All OK!fn(window);fn({});fn(fn);Try
```

# Generics

 

A major part of software engineering is building components that not only have well-defined and consistent APIs, but are also reusable.
Components that are capable of working on the data of today as well as the data of tomorrow will give you the most flexible capabilities for building up large software systems.

In languages like C# and Java, one of the main tools in the toolbox for creating reusable components is generics , that is, being able to create a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one.
This allows users to consume these components and use their own types.

## Hello World of Generics

To start off, let’s do the “hello world” of generics: the identity function.
The identity function is a function that will return back whatever is passed in.
You can think of this in a similar way to the `echo` command.

Without generics, we would either have to give the identity function a specific type:



```id
tsfunction identity(arg: number): number {  return arg;}Try
```



Or, we could describe the identity function using the `any` type:



```id
tsfunction identity(arg: any): any {  return arg;}Try
```



While using `any` is certainly generic in that it will cause the function to accept any and all types for the type of `arg`, we actually are losing the information about what that type was when the function returns.
If we passed in a number, the only information we have is that any type could be returned.

Instead, we need a way of capturing the type of the argument in such a way that we can also use it to denote what is being returned.
Here, we will use a type variable , a special kind of variable that works on types rather than values.



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;}Try
```



We’ve now added a type variable `Type` to the identity function.
This `Type` allows us to capture the type the user provides (e.g. `number`), so that we can use that information later.
Here, we use `Type` again as the return type. On inspection, we can now see the same type is used for the argument and the return type.
This allows us to traffic that type information in one side of the function and out the other.

We say that this version of the `identity` function is generic, as it works over a range of types.
Unlike using `any`, it’s also just as precise (i.e., it doesn’t lose any information) as the first `identity` function that used numbers for the argument and return type.

Once we’ve written the generic identity function, we can call it in one of two ways.
The first way is to pass all of the arguments, including the type argument, to the function:



```id
tslet output = (arg: string): string' >identity<string>("myString");      let output: stringTry
```



Here we explicitly set `Type` to be `string` as one of the arguments to the function call, denoted using the `<>` around the arguments rather than `()`.

The second way is also perhaps the most common. Here we use type argument inference — that is, we want the compiler to set the value of `Type` for us automatically based on the type of the argument we pass in:



```id
tslet output = (arg: "myString"): "myString"' >identity("myString");      let output: stringTry
```



Notice that we didn’t have to explicitly pass the type in the angle brackets (`<>`); the compiler just looked at the value `"myString"`, and set `Type` to its type.
While type argument inference can be a helpful tool to keep code shorter and more readable, you may need to explicitly pass in the type arguments as we did in the previous example when the compiler fails to infer the type, as may happen in more complex examples.

## Working with Generic Type Variables

When you begin to use generics, you’ll notice that when you create generic functions like `identity`, the compiler will enforce that you use any generically typed parameters in the body of the function correctly.
That is, that you actually treat these parameters as if they could be any and all types.

Let’s take our `identity` function from earlier:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;}Try
```



What if we want to also log the length of the argument `arg` to the console with each call?
We might be tempted to write this:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  console.log(arg.length);Property 'length' does not exist on type 'Type'.2339Property 'length' does not exist on type 'Type'.  return arg;}Try
```



When we do, the compiler will give us an error that we’re using the `.length` member of `arg`, but nowhere have we said that `arg` has this member.
Remember, we said earlier that these type variables stand in for any and all types, so someone using this function could have passed in a `number` instead, which does not have a `.length` member.

Let’s say that we’ve actually intended this function to work on arrays of `Type` rather than `Type` directly. Since we’re working with arrays, the `.length` member should be available.
We can describe this just like we would create arrays of other types:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type[]): Type[]' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Type[]): Type[]' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[]): (arg: Type[]): Type[]' >Type[] {  console.log(arg..length: number' >length);  return arg;}Try
```



You can read the type of `loggingIdentity` as “the generic function `loggingIdentity` takes a type parameter `Type`, and an argument `arg` which is an array of `Type`s, and returns an array of `Type`s.”
If we passed in an array of numbers, we’d get an array of numbers back out, as `Type` would bind to `number`.
This allows us to use our generic type variable `Type` as part of the types we’re working with, rather than the whole type, giving us greater flexibility.

We can alternatively write the sample example this way:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type>' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type>' >Type>(arg: ' >Array<(arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type>' >Type>): ' >Array<(arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type>' >Type> {  console.log(arg..length: number' >length); // Array has a .length, so no more error  return arg;}Try
```



You may already be familiar with this style of type from other languages.
In the next section, we’ll cover how you can create your own generic types like `Array `.

## Generic Types

In previous sections, we created generic identity functions that worked over a range of types.
In this section, we’ll explore the type of the functions themselves and how to create generic interfaces.

The type of generic functions is just like those of non-generic functions, with the type parameters listed first, similarly to function declarations:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let (arg: Type) => Type' >myIdentity: <(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type) => (arg: Type): Type' >Type = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



We could also have used a different name for the generic type parameter in the type, so long as the number of type variables and how the type variables are used line up.



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let (arg: Input) => Input' >myIdentity: <(arg: Input): Input' >Input>(arg: (arg: Input): Input' >Input) => (arg: Input): Input' >Input = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



We can also write the generic type as a call signature of an object literal type:



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let (arg: Type) => Type' >myIdentity: { <(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type } = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



Which leads us to writing our first generic interface.
Let’s take the object literal from the previous example and move it to an interface:



```id
tsinterface GenericIdentityFn {  <(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type;} function (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



In a similar example, we may want to move the generic parameter to be a parameter of the whole interface.
This lets us see what type(s) we’re generic over (e.g. `Dictionary ` rather than just `Dictionary`).
This makes the type parameter visible to all the other members of the interface.



```id
tsinterface ' >GenericIdentityFn<' >Type> {  (arg: ' >Type): ' >Type;} function (arg: Type): Type' >identity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  return arg;} let ' >myIdentity: ' >GenericIdentityFn<number> = (arg: Type): Type' >identity;Try
```



Notice that our example has changed to be something slightly different.
Instead of describing a generic function, we now have a non-generic function signature that is a part of a generic type.
When we use `GenericIdentityFn`, we now will also need to specify the corresponding type argument (here: `number`), effectively locking in what the underlying call signature will use.
Understanding when to put the type parameter directly on the call signature and when to put it on the interface itself will be helpful in describing what aspects of a type are generic.

In addition to generic interfaces, we can also create generic classes.
Note that it is not possible to create generic enums and namespaces.

## Generic Classes

A generic class has a similar shape to a generic interface.
Generic classes have a generic type parameter list in angle brackets (`<>`) following the name of the class.



```id
tsclass ' >GenericNumber<' >NumType> {  .zeroValue: NumType' >zeroValue: ' >NumType;  .add: (x: NumType, y: NumType) => NumType' >add: (x: ' >NumType, y: ' >NumType) => ' >NumType;} let ' >myGenericNumber = new (): GenericNumber<number>' >GenericNumber<number>();' >myGenericNumber..zeroValue: number' >zeroValue = 0;' >myGenericNumber..add: (x: number, y: number) => number' >add = function (x, y) {  return x + y;};Try
```



This is a pretty literal use of the `GenericNumber` class, but you may have noticed that nothing is restricting it to only use the `number` type.
We could have instead used `string` or even more complex objects.



```id
tslet ' >stringNumeric = new (): GenericNumber<string>' >GenericNumber<string>();' >stringNumeric..zeroValue: string' >zeroValue = "";' >stringNumeric..add: (x: string, y: string) => string' >add = function (x, y) {  return x + y;}; console.log(' >stringNumeric..add: (x: string, y: string) => string' >add(' >stringNumeric..zeroValue: string' >zeroValue, "test"));Try
```



Just as with interface, putting the type parameter on the class itself lets us make sure all of the properties of the class are working with the same type.

As we cover in our section on classes , a class has two sides to its type: the static side and the instance side.
Generic classes are only generic over their instance side rather than their static side, so when working with classes, static members can not use the class’s type parameter.

## Generic Constraints

If you remember from an earlier example, you may sometimes want to write a generic function that works on a set of types where you have some knowledge about what capabilities that set of types will have.
In our `loggingIdentity` example, we wanted to be able to access the `.length` property of `arg`, but the compiler could not prove that every type had a `.length` property, so it warns us that we can’t make this assumption.



```id
tsfunction (arg: Type): Type' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  console.log(arg.length);Property 'length' does not exist on type 'Type'.2339Property 'length' does not exist on type 'Type'.  return arg;}Try
```



Instead of working with any and all types, we’d like to constrain this function to work with any and all types that also   have the `.length` property.
As long as the type has this member, we’ll allow it, but it’s required to have at least this member.
To do so, we must list our requirement as a constraint on what `Type` can be.

To do so, we’ll create an interface that describes our constraint.
Here, we’ll create an interface that has a single `.length` property and then we’ll use this interface and the `extends` keyword to denote our constraint:



```id
tsinterface Lengthwise {  length: number;} function (arg: Type): Type' >loggingIdentity<(arg: Type): Type' >Type extends Lengthwise>(arg: (arg: Type): Type' >Type): (arg: Type): Type' >Type {  console.log(arg.length); // Now we know it has a .length property, so no more error  return arg;}Try
```



Because the generic function is now constrained, it will no longer work over any and all types:



```id
ts(arg: Lengthwise): Lengthwise' >loggingIdentity(3);Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Lengthwise'.2345Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Lengthwise'.Try
```



Instead, we need to pass in values whose type has all the required properties:



```id
ts(arg: {
    length: number;
    value: number;
}): {
    length: number;
    value: number;
}' >loggingIdentity({ length: 10, value: 3 });Try
```



## Using Type Parameters in Generic Constraints

You can declare a type parameter that is constrained by another type parameter.
For example, here we’d like to get a property from an object given its name.
We’d like to ensure that we’re not accidentally grabbing a property that does not exist on the `obj`, so we’ll place a constraint between the two types:



```id
tsfunction (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >getProperty<(obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Type, (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Key extends keyof (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Type>(obj: (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Type, key: (obj: Type, key: Key): Type[Key]' >Key) {  return obj[key];} let x = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }; (obj: {
    a: number;
    b: number;
    c: number;
    d: number;
}, key: "a"): number' >getProperty(x, "a");(obj: {
    a: number;
    b: number;
    c: number;
    d: number;
}, key: "a" | "b" | "c" | "d"): number' >getProperty(x, "m");Argument of type '"m"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"a" | "b" | "c" | "d"'.2345Argument of type '"m"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"a" | "b" | "c" | "d"'.Try
```



## Using Class Types in Generics

When creating factories in TypeScript using generics, it is necessary to refer to class types by their constructor functions. For example,



```id
tsfunction (c: {
    new (): Type;
}): Type' >create<(c: {
    new (): Type;
}): Type' >Type>( Type' >c: { new (): (c: {
    new (): Type;
}): Type' >Type }): (c: {
    new (): Type;
}): Type' >Type {  return new  Type' >c();}Try
```



A more advanced example uses the prototype property to infer and constrain relationships between the constructor function and the instance side of class types.



```id
tsclass BeeKeeper {  hasMask: boolean = true;} class ZooKeeper {  nametag: string = "Mikle";} class Animal {  numLegs: number = 4;} class Bee extends Animal {  numLegs = 6;  keeper: BeeKeeper = new BeeKeeper();} class Lion extends Animal {  keeper: ZooKeeper = new ZooKeeper();} function (c: new () => A): A' >createInstance<(c: new () => A): A' >A extends Animal>( A' >c: new () => (c: new () => A): A' >A): (c: new () => A): A' >A {  return new  A' >c();} (c: new () => Lion): Lion' >createInstance(Lion).keeper.nametag;(c: new () => Bee): Bee' >createInstance(Bee).keeper.hasMask;Try
```



This pattern is used to power the mixins design pattern.

## Generic Parameter Defaults

By declaring a default for a generic type parameter, you make it optional to specify the corresponding type argument. For example, a function which creates a new `HTMLElement`. Calling the function with no arguments generates a `HTMLDivElement`; calling the function with an element as the first argument generates an element of the argument’s type. You can optionally pass a list of children as well. Previously you would have to define the function as:



```id
tsdeclare function  (+2 overloads)' >create():  = {
    element: T;
    children: U;
}' >Container<HTMLDivElement, HTMLDivElement[]>;declare function (element: T): Container<T, T[]> (+2 overloads)' >create<(element: T): Container<T, T[]>' >T extends HTMLElement>(element: (element: T): Container<T, T[]>' >T):  = {
    element: T;
    children: U;
}' >Container<(element: T): Container<T, T[]>' >T, (element: T): Container<T, T[]>' >T[]>;declare function (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]> (+2 overloads)' >create<(element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >T extends HTMLElement, (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >U extends HTMLElement>(  element: (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >T,  children: (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >U[]):  = {
    element: T;
    children: U;
}' >Container<(element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >T, (element: T, children: U[]): Container<T, U[]>' >U[]>;Try
```



With generic parameter defaults we can reduce it to:



```id
tsdeclare function (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >create<(element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >T extends HTMLElement = HTMLDivElement, (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >U extends HTMLElement[] = (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >T[]>(  element?: (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >T,  children?: (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >U):  = {
    element: T;
    children: U;
}' >Container<(element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >T, (element?: T, children?: U): Container<T, U>' >U>; const ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>div = (element?: HTMLDivElement | undefined, children?: HTMLDivElement[] | undefined): Container<HTMLDivElement, HTMLDivElement[]>' >create();      const div: Container<HTMLDivElement, HTMLDivElement[]> const ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>p = (element?: HTMLParagraphElement | undefined, children?: HTMLParagraphElement[] | undefined): Container<HTMLParagraphElement, HTMLParagraphElement[]>' >create(new  HTMLParagraphElement' >HTMLParagraphElement());     const p: Container<HTMLParagraphElement, HTMLParagraphElement[]>Try
```



A generic parameter default follows the following rules:

 A type parameter is deemed optional if it has a default.

- Required type parameters must not follow optional type parameters.

- Default types for a type parameter must satisfy the constraint for the type parameter, if it exists.

- When specifying type arguments, you are only required to specify type arguments for the required type parameters. Unspecified type parameters will resolve to their default types.

- If a default type is specified and inference cannot choose a candidate, the default type is inferred.

- A class or interface declaration that merges with an existing class or interface declaration may introduce a default for an existing type parameter.

- A class or interface declaration that merges with an existing class or interface declaration may introduce a new type parameter as long as it specifies a default.

## Variance Annotations

 

This is an advanced feature for solving a very specific problem, and should only be used in situations where you’ve identified a reason to use it

 

 Covariance and contravariance are type theory terms that describe what the relationship between two generic types is.
Here’s a brief primer on the concept.

For example, if you have an interface representing an object that can `make` a certain type:



```id
tsinterface Producer<T> {  make(): T;}
```



We can use a `Producer ` where a `Producer ` is expected, because a `Cat` is an `Animal`.
This relationship is called covariance : the relationship from `Producer ` to `Producer ` is the same as the relationship from `T` to `U`.

Conversely, if you have an interface that can `consume` a certain type:



```id
tsinterface Consumer<T> {  consume: (arg: T) => void;}
```



Then we can use a `Consumer ` where a `Consumer ` is expected, because any function that is capable of accepting an `Animal` must also be capable of accepting a `Cat`.
This relationship is called contravariance : the relationship from `Consumer ` to `Consumer ` is the same as the relationship from `U` to `T`.
Note the reversal of direction as compared to covariance! This is why contravariance “cancels itself out” but covariance doesn’t.

In a structural type system like TypeScript’s, covariance and contravariance are naturally emergent behaviors that follow from the definition of types.
Even in the absence of generics, we would see covariant (and contravariant) relationships:



```id
tsinterface AnimalProducer {  make(): Animal;}// A CatProducer can be used anywhere an// Animal producer is expectedinterface CatProducer {  make(): Cat;}
```



TypeScript has a structural type system, so when comparing two types, e.g. to see if a `Producer ` can be used where a `Producer ` is expected, the usual algorithm would be structurally expand both of those definitions, and compare their structures.
However, variance allows for an extremely useful optimization: if `Producer ` is covariant on `T`, then we can simply check `Cat` and `Animal` instead, as we know they’ll have the same relationship as `Producer ` and `Producer `.

Note that this logic can only be used when we’re examining two instantiations of the same type.
If we have a `Producer ` and a `FastProducer `, there’s no guarantee that `T` and `U` necessarily refer to the same positions in these types, so this check will always be performed structurally.

Because variance is a naturally emergent property of structural types, TypeScript automatically infers the variance of every generic type.
 In extremely rare cases involving certain kinds of circular types, this measurement can be inaccurate.
If this happens, you can add a variance annotation to a type parameter to force a particular variance:



```id
ts// Contravariant annotationinterface Consumer<in T> {  consume: (arg: T) => void;}// Covariant annotationinterface Producer<out T> {  make(): T;}// Invariant annotationinterface ProducerConsumer<in out T> {  consume: (arg: T) => void;  make(): T;}
```



Only do this if you are writing the same variance that should occur structurally.

 

Never write a variance annotation that doesn’t match the structural variance!

 

It’s critical to reinforce that variance annotations are only in effect during an instantiation-based comparison.
They have no effect during a structural comparison.
For example, you can’t use variance annotations to “force” a type to be actually invariant:



```id
ts// DON'T DO THIS - variance annotation// does not match structural behaviorinterface Producer<in out T> {  make(): T;}// Not a type error -- this is a structural// comparison, so variance annotations are// not in effectconst p: Producer<string | number> = {    make(): number {        return 42;    }}
```



Here, the object literal’s `make` function returns `number`, which we might expect to cause an error because `number` isn’t `string | number`.
However, this isn’t an instantiation-based comparison, because the object literal is an anonymous type, not a `Producer `.

 

Variance annotations don’t change structural behavior and are only consulted in specific situations

 

It’s very important to only write variance annotations if you absolutely know why you’re doing it, what their limitations are, and when they aren’t in effect.
Whether TypeScript uses an instantiation-based comparison or structural comparison is not a specified behavior and may change from version to version for correctness or performance reasons, so you should only ever write variance annotations when they match the structural behavior of a type.
Don’t use variance annotations to try to “force” a particular variance; this will cause unpredictable behavior in your code.

 

Do NOT write variance annotations unless they match the structural behavior of a type

 

Remember, TypeScript can automatically infer variance from your generic types.
It’s almost never necessary to write a variance annotation, and you should only do so when you’ve identified a specific need.
Variance annotations do not change the structural behavior of a type, and depending on the situation, you might see a structural comparison made when you expected an instantiation-based comparison.
Variance annotations can’t be used to modify how types behave in these structural contexts, and shouldn’t be written unless the annotation is the same as the structural definition.
Because this is difficult to get right, and TypeScript can correctly infer variance in the vast majority of cases, you should not find yourself writing variance annotations in normal code.

 

Don’t try to use variance annotations to change typechecking behavior; this is not what they are for

 

You may find temporary variance annotations useful in a “type debugging” situation, because variance annotations are checked.
TypeScript will issue an error if the annotated variance is identifiably wrong:



```id
ts// Error, this interface is definitely contravariant on Tinterface Foo<out T> {  consume: (arg: T) => void;}
```



However, variance annotations are allowed to be stricter (e.g. `in out` is valid if the actual variance is covariant).
Be sure to remove your variance annotations once you’re done debugging.

Lastly, if you’re trying to maximize your typechecking performance, and have run a profiler, and have identified a specific type that’s slow, and have identified variance inference specifically is slow, and have carefully validated the variance annotation you want to write, you may see a small performance benefit in extraordinarily complex types by adding variance annotations.

 

Don’t try to use variance annotations to change typechecking behavior; this is not what they are for

# Modules

 

JavaScript has a long history of different ways to handle modularizing code.
Having been around since 2012, TypeScript has implemented support for a lot of these formats, but over time the community and the JavaScript specification has converged on a format called ES Modules (or ES6 modules). You might know it as the `import`/`export` syntax.

ES Modules was added to the JavaScript spec in 2015, and by 2020 had broad support in most web browsers and JavaScript runtimes.

For focus, the handbook will cover both ES Modules and its popular pre-cursor CommonJS `module.exports =` syntax, and you can find information about the other module patterns in the reference section under Modules .

## How JavaScript Modules are Defined

In TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing a top-level `import` or `export` is considered a module.

Conversely, a file without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a script whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore to modules as well).

Modules are executed within their own scope, not in the global scope.
This means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported using one of the export forms.
Conversely, to consume a variable, function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, it has to be imported using one of the import forms.

## Non-modules

Before we start, it’s important to understand what TypeScript considers a module.
The JavaScript specification declares that any JavaScript files without an `import` declaration, `export`, or top-level `await` should be considered a script and not a module.

 Inside a script file variables and types are declared to be in the shared global scope, and it’s assumed that you’ll either use the `outFile` compiler option to join multiple input files into one output file, or use multiple `

# Keyof Type Operator

 

## The `keyof` type operator

The `keyof` operator takes an object type and produces a string or numeric literal union of its keys.
The following type `P` is the same type as `type P = "x" | "y"`:



```id
tstype Point = { x: number; y: number };type P = keyof Point;    type P = keyof PointTry
```



If the type has a `string` or `number` index signature, `keyof` will return those types instead:



```id
tstype Arrayish = { [n: number]: unknown };type A = keyof Arrayish;    type A = number type Mapish = { [k: string]: boolean };type M = keyof Mapish;    type M = string | numberTry
```



Note that in this example, `M` is `string | number` — this is because JavaScript object keys are always coerced to a string, so `obj[0]` is always the same as `obj["0"]`.

`keyof` types become especially useful when combined with mapped types, which we’ll learn more about later.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Utility Types

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html

TypeScript: Documentation - Utility Types 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Utility Types

 

TypeScript provides several utility types to facilitate common type transformations. These utilities are available globally.

## `Awaited `

 

Released:
 4.5 

 

This type is meant to model operations like `await` in `async` functions, or the
`.then()` method on `Promise`s - specifically, the way that they recursively
unwrap `Promise`s.

 Example 


```id
tstype A =  = T extends null | undefined ? T : T extends object & {
    then(onfulfilled: infer F, ...args: infer _): any;
} ? F extends (value: infer V, ...args: infer _) => any ? Awaited<V> : never : T' >Awaited<' >Promise<string>>;    type A = string type B =  = T extends null | undefined ? T : T extends object & {
    then(onfulfilled: infer F, ...args: infer _): any;
} ? F extends (value: infer V, ...args: infer _) => any ? Awaited<V> : never : T' >Awaited<' >Promise<' >Promise<number>>>;    type B = number type C =  = T extends null | undefined ? T : T extends object & {
    then(onfulfilled: infer F, ...args: infer _): any;
} ? F extends (value: infer V, ...args: infer _) => any ? Awaited<V> : never : T' >Awaited<boolean | ' >Promise<number>>;    type C = number | booleanTry
```



## `Partial `

 

Released:

 2.1 

 

Constructs a type with all properties of `Type` set to optional. This utility will return a type that represents all subsets of a given type.

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Todo {  title: string;  description: string;} function ): {
    title: string;
    description: string;
}' >updateTodo(todo: Todo, ' >fieldsToUpdate:  = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P] | undefined; }' >Partial<Todo>) {  return { ...todo, ...' >fieldsToUpdate };} const todo1 = {  title: "organize desk",  description: "clear clutter",}; const todo2 = ): {
    title: string;
    description: string;
}' >updateTodo(todo1, {  description: "throw out trash",});Try
```



## `Required `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type consisting of all properties of `Type` set to required. The opposite of `Partial` .

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Props {  a?: number;  b?: string;} const obj: Props = { a: 5 }; const ' >obj2:  = { [P in keyof T]-?: T[P]; }' >Required<Props> = { a: 5 };Property 'b' is missing in type '{ a: number; }' but required in type 'Required<Props>'.2741Property 'b' is missing in type '{ a: number; }' but required in type 'Required<Props>'.Try
```



## `Readonly `

 

Released:

 2.1 

 

Constructs a type with all properties of `Type` set to `readonly`, meaning the properties of the constructed type cannot be reassigned.

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Todo {  title: string;} const ' >todo:  = { readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P]; }' >Readonly<Todo> = {  title: "Delete inactive users",}; ' >todo.title = "Hello";Cannot assign to 'title' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'title' because it is a read-only property.Try
```



This utility is useful for representing assignment expressions that will fail at runtime (i.e. when attempting to reassign properties of a frozen object ).

 `Object.freeze` 


```id
tsfunction freeze<Type>(obj: Type): Readonly<Type>;
```



## `Record `

 

Released:

 2.1 

 

Constructs an object type whose property keys are `Keys` and whose property values are `Type`. This utility can be used to map the properties of a type to another type.

 Example 


```id
tstype CatName = "miffy" | "boris" | "mordred"; interface CatInfo {  age: number;  breed: string;} const ' >cats:  = { [P in K]: T; }' >Record<CatName, CatInfo> = {  miffy: { age: 10, breed: "Persian" },  boris: { age: 5, breed: "Maine Coon" },  mordred: { age: 16, breed: "British Shorthair" },}; ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>cats.boris; const cats: Record<CatName, CatInfo>Try
```



## `Pick `

 

Released:

 2.1 

 

Constructs a type by picking the set of properties `Keys` (string literal or union of string literals) from `Type`.

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Todo {  title: string;  description: string;  completed: boolean;} type TodoPreview =  = { [P in K]: T[P]; }' >Pick<Todo, "title" | "completed">; const todo: TodoPreview = {  title: "Clean room",  completed: false,}; todo; const todo: TodoPreviewTry
```



## `Omit `

 

Released:

 3.5 

 

Constructs a type by picking all properties from `Type` and then removing `Keys` (string literal or union of string literals). The opposite of `Pick` .

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Todo {  title: string;  description: string;  completed: boolean;  createdAt: number;} type TodoPreview =  = { [P in Exclude<keyof T, K>]: T[P]; }' >Omit<Todo, "description">; const todo: TodoPreview = {  title: "Clean room",  completed: false,  createdAt: 1615544252770,}; todo; const todo: TodoPreview type TodoInfo =  = { [P in Exclude<keyof T, K>]: T[P]; }' >Omit<Todo, "completed" | "createdAt">; const todoInfo: TodoInfo = {  title: "Pick up kids",  description: "Kindergarten closes at 5pm",}; todoInfo;   const todoInfo: TodoInfoTry
```



## `Exclude `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type by excluding from `UnionType` all union members that are assignable to `ExcludedMembers`.

 Example 


```id
tstype T0 =  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<"a" | "b" | "c", "a">;     type T0 = "b" | "c"type T1 =  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<"a" | "b" | "c", "a" | "b">;     type T1 = "c"type T2 =  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<string | number | (() => void), Function>;     type T2 = string | number type Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; x: number }  | { kind: "triangle"; x: number; y: number }; type T3 =  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<Shape, { kind: "circle" }>     type T3 = {
    kind: "square";
    x: number;
} | {
    kind: "triangle";
    x: number;
    y: number;
}Try
```



## `Extract `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type by extracting from `Type` all union members that are assignable to `Union`.

 Example 


```id
tstype T0 =  = T extends U ? T : never' >Extract<"a" | "b" | "c", "a" | "f">;     type T0 = "a"type  void' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>T1 =  = T extends U ? T : never' >Extract<string | number | (() => void), Function>;     type T1 = () => void type Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; x: number }  | { kind: "triangle"; x: number; y: number }; type T2 =  = T extends U ? T : never' >Extract<Shape, { kind: "circle" }>     type T2 = {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}Try
```



## `NonNullable `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type by excluding `null` and `undefined` from `Type`.

 Example 


```id
tstype T0 =  = T & {}' >NonNullable<string | number | undefined>;     type T0 = string | numbertype T1 =  = T & {}' >NonNullable<string[] | null | undefined>;     type T1 = string[]Try
```



## `Parameters `

 

Released:

 3.1 

 

Constructs a tuple type from the types used in the parameters of a function type `Type`.

For overloaded functions, this will be the parameters of the last signature; see Inferring Within Conditional Types .

 Example 


```id
tsdeclare function f1(arg: { a: number; b: string }): void; type T0 =  any> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >Parameters<() => string>;     type T0 = []type T1 =  any> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ?

P : never' >Parameters<string>;Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.2344Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.     type T6 = nevertype T7 =  any> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >Parameters<Function>;Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature '(...args: any): any'.2344Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature '(...args: any): any'.     type T7 = neverTry
```



## `ConstructorParameters `

 

Released:

 3.1 

 

Constructs a tuple or array type from the types of a constructor function type. It produces a tuple type with all the parameter types (or the type `never` if `Type` is not a function).

 Example 


```id
tstype T0 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >ConstructorParameters<ErrorConstructor>;     type T0 = [message?: string]type T1 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >ConstructorParameters<FunctionConstructor>;     type T1 = string[]type T2 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ?

P : never' >ConstructorParameters<any>;     type T4 = unknown[] type T5 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >ConstructorParameters<Function>;Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature 'new (...args: any): any'.2344Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature 'new (...args: any): any'.     type T5 = neverTry
```



## `ReturnType `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type consisting of the return type of function `Type`.

For overloaded functions, this will be the return type of the last signature; see Inferring Within Conditional Types .

 Example 


```id
tsdeclare function f1(): { a: number; b: string }; type T0 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<() => string>;     type T0 = stringtype T1 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<(s: string) => void>;     type T1 = voidtype T2 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ?

R : any' >ReturnType<string>;Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.2344Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.     type T7 = anytype T8 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<Function>;Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature '(...args: any): any'.2344Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature '(...args: any): any'.     type T8 = anyTry
```



## `InstanceType `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type consisting of the instance type of a constructor function in `Type`.

 Example 


```id
tsclass C {  x = 0;  y = 0;} type T0 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >InstanceType<typeof C>;     type T0 = Ctype T1 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ?

R : any' >InstanceType<Function>;Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature 'new (...args: any): any'.2344Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature 'new (...args: any): any'.     type T4 = anyTry
```



## `NoInfer `

 

Released:

 5.4 

 

Blocks inferences to the contained type. Other than blocking inferences, `NoInfer ` is
identical to `Type`.

 Example 


```id
tsfunction createStreetLight<C extends string>(  colors: C[],  defaultColor?: NoInfer<C>,) {  // ...}createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "red");  // OKcreateStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "blue");  // Error
```



## `ThisParameterType `

 

Released:

 3.3 

 

Extracts the type of the this parameter for a function type, or unknown if the function type has no `this` parameter.

 Example 


```id
tsfunction toHex(this: Number) {  return this.toString(16);} function ): string' >numberToString(n:  = T extends (this: infer U, ...args: never) => any ? U : unknown' >ThisParameterType<typeof toHex>) {  return toHex.(this: (this: Number) => string, thisArg: Number): string (+1 overload)' >apply(n);}Try
```



## `OmitThisParameter `

 

Released:

 3.3 

 

Removes the `this` parameter from `Type`. If `Type` has no explicitly declared `this` parameter, the result is simply `Type`. Otherwise, a new function type with no `this` parameter is created from `Type`. Generics are erased and only the last overload signature is propagated into the new function type.

 Example 


```id
tsfunction toHex(this: Number) {  return this.toString(16);} const  string' >fiveToHex:  = unknown extends ThisParameterType<T> ? T : T extends (...args: infer A) => infer R ? (...args: A) => R : T' >OmitThisParameter<typeof toHex> = toHex. string>(this: (this: Number) => string, thisArg: Number): () => string (+1 overload)' >bind(5); console.log( string' >fiveToHex());Try
```



## `ThisType `

 

Released:

 2.3 

 

This utility does not return a transformed type. Instead, it serves as a marker for a contextual `this` type. Note that the `noImplicitThis` flag must be enabled to use this utility.

 Example 


```id
tstype  = {
    data?: D;
    methods?: M & ThisType<D & M>;
}' >ObjectDescriptor<' >D, ' >M> = {  data?: ' >D;  ) | undefined' >methods?: ' >M & ' >ThisType<' >D & ' >M>; // Type of &apos;this&apos; in methods is D & M}; function (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >makeObject<(desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >D, (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >M>(' >desc:  = {
    data?: D;
    methods?: M & ThisType<D & M>;
}' >ObjectDescriptor<(desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >D, (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >M>): (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >D & (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >M {  let data: object = ' >desc.data || {};  let methods: object = ' >desc.) | undefined' >methods || {};  return { ...data, ...methods } as (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >D & (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >M;} let obj = (desc: ObjectDescriptor<{
    x: number;
    y: number;
}, {
    moveBy(dx: number, dy: number): void;
}>): {
    x: number;
    y: number;
} & {
    moveBy(dx: number, dy: number): void;
}' >makeObject({  data: { x: 0, y: 0 },  ) | undefined' >methods: {    moveBy(dx: number, dy: number) {      this.x += dx; // Strongly typed this      this.y += dy; // Strongly typed this    },  },}); obj.x = 10;obj.y = 20;obj.moveBy(5, 5);Try
```



In the example above, the `methods` object in the argument to `makeObject` has a contextual type that includes `ThisType ` and therefore the type of this in methods within the `methods` object is 

```
{ x: number, y: number } & { moveBy(dx: number, dy: number): void }
```

. Notice how the type of the `methods` property simultaneously is an inference target and a source for the `this` type in methods.

The `ThisType ` marker interface is simply an empty interface declared in `lib.d.ts`. Beyond being recognized in the contextual type of an object literal, the interface acts like any empty interface.

## Intrinsic String Manipulation Types

### `Uppercase `

### `Lowercase `

### `Capitalize `

### `Uncapitalize `

To help with string manipulation around template string literals, TypeScript includes a set of types which can be used in string manipulation within the type system. You can find those in the Template Literal Types documentation.

TypeScript: Documentation - Typeof Type Operator 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Typeof Type Operator

 

## The `typeof` type operator

JavaScript already has a `typeof` operator you can use in an expression context:



```id
ts// Prints "string"console.log(typeof "Hello world");Try
```



TypeScript adds a `typeof` operator you can use in a type context to refer to the type of a variable or property:



```id
tslet s = "hello";let n: typeof s;   let n: stringTry
```



This isn’t very useful for basic types, but combined with other type operators, you can use `typeof` to conveniently express many patterns.
For an example, let’s start by looking at the predefined type `ReturnType `.
It takes a function type and produces its return type:



```id
tstype  boolean' >Predicate = (x: unknown) => boolean;type K =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType< boolean' >Predicate>;    type K = booleanTry
```



If we try to use `ReturnType` on a function name, we see an instructive error:



```id
tsfunction f() {  return { x: 10, y: 3 };}type P =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<f>;'f' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof f'?2749'f' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof f'?Try
```



Remember that values and types aren’t the same thing.
To refer to the type that the value `f` has, we use `typeof`:



```id
tsfunction f() {  return { x: 10, y: 3 };}type P =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<typeof f>;    type P = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}Try
```



### Limitations

TypeScript intentionally limits the sorts of expressions you can use `typeof` on.

Specifically, it’s only legal to use `typeof` on identifiers (i.e. variable names) or their properties.
This helps avoid the confusing trap of writing code you think is executing, but isn’t:



```id

# Indexed Access Types

 

We can use an indexed access type to look up a specific property on another type:



```id
tstype Person = { age: number; name: string; alive: boolean };type Age = Person["age"];     type Age = numberTry
```



The indexing type is itself a type, so we can use unions, `keyof`, or other types entirely:



```id
tstype I1 = Person["age" | "name"];     type I1 = string | number type I2 = Person[keyof Person];     type I2 = string | number | boolean type AliveOrName = "alive" | "name";type I3 = Person[AliveOrName];     type I3 = string | booleanTry
```



You’ll even see an error if you try to index a property that doesn’t exist:



```id
tstype I1 = Person["alve"];Property 'alve' does not exist on type 'Person'.2339Property 'alve' does not exist on type 'Person'.Try
```



Another example of indexing with an arbitrary type is using `number` to get the type of an array’s elements.
We can combine this with `typeof` to conveniently capture the element type of an array literal:



```id
tsconst MyArray = [  { name: "Alice", age: 15 },  { name: "Bob", age: 23 },  { name: "Eve", age: 38 },]; type Person = typeof MyArray[number];       type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}type Age = typeof MyArray[number]["age"];     type Age = number// Ortype Age2 = Person["age"];      type Age2 = numberTry
```



You can only use types when indexing, meaning you can’t use a `const` to make a variable reference:



```id
tsconst key = "age";type Age = Person[key];Type 'key' cannot be used as an index type.'key' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof key'?2538
2749Type 'key' cannot be used as an index type.'key' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof key'?Try
```



However, you can use a type alias for a similar style of refactor:



```id
tstype key = "age";type Age = Person[key];Try
```

### TypeScript: Documentation - Decorators

# Decorators

 

NOTE  This document refers to an experimental stage 2 decorators implementation. Stage 3 decorator support is available since Typescript 5.0.
See: Decorators in Typescript 5.0 

 

## Introduction

With the introduction of Classes in TypeScript and ES6, there now exist certain scenarios that require additional features to support annotating or modifying classes and class members.
Decorators provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.

 

Further Reading (stage 2): A Complete Guide to TypeScript Decorators 

 

To enable experimental support for decorators, you must enable the `experimentalDecorators` compiler option either on the command line or in your `tsconfig.json`:

 Command Line :



```id
shelltsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators
```



 tsconfig.json :



```
{  "compilerOptions": {    "target": "ES5",    "experimentalDecorators": true  }}
```



## Decorators

A Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration , method , accessor , property , or parameter .
Decorators use the form `@expression`, where `expression` must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.

For example, given the decorator `@sealed` we might write the `sealed` function as follows:



```id
tsfunction sealed(target) {  // do something with 'target' ...}
```



## Decorator Factories

If we want to customize how a decorator is applied to a declaration, we can write a decorator factory.
A Decorator Factory is simply a function that returns the expression that will be called by the decorator at runtime.

We can write a decorator factory in the following fashion:



```id
tsfunction color(value: string) {  // this is the decorator factory, it sets up  // the returned decorator function  return function (target) {    // this is the decorator    // do something with 'target' and 'value'...  };}
```



## Decorator Composition

Multiple decorators can be applied to a declaration, for example on a single line:



```id
ts@f @g xTry
```



On multiple lines:



```id
ts@f@gxTry
```



When multiple decorators apply to a single declaration, their evaluation is similar to function composition in mathematics . In this model, when composing functions f and g , the resulting composite ( f ∘ g )( x ) is equivalent to f ( g ( x )).

As such, the following steps are performed when evaluating multiple decorators on a single declaration in TypeScript:

 The expressions for each decorator are evaluated top-to-bottom.

- The results are then called as functions from bottom-to-top.

If we were to use decorator factories , we can observe this evaluation order with the following example:

 


```id
tsfunction  void' >first() {  console.log("first(): factory evaluated");  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {    console.log("first(): called");  };} function  void' >second() {  console.log("second(): factory evaluated");  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {    console.log("second(): called");  };} class ExampleClass {  @ void' >first()  @ void' >second()  method() {}}Try
```



Which would print this output to the console:



```id
shellfirst(): factory evaluatedsecond(): factory evaluatedsecond(): calledfirst(): called
```



## Decorator Evaluation

There is a well defined order to how decorators applied to various declarations inside of a class are applied:

- Parameter Decorators , followed by Method , Accessor , or Property Decorators are applied for each instance member.

- Parameter Decorators , followed by Method , Accessor , or Property Decorators are applied for each static member.

- Parameter Decorators are applied for the constructor.

- Class Decorators are applied for the class.

## Class Decorators

A Class Decorator is declared just before a class declaration.
The class decorator is applied to the constructor of the class and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a class definition.
A class decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as on a `declare` class).

The expression for the class decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the constructor of the decorated class as its only argument.

If the class decorator returns a value, it will replace the class declaration with the provided constructor function.

 

NOTE  Should you choose to return a new constructor function, you must take care to maintain the original prototype.
The logic that applies decorators at runtime will not do this for you.

 

The following is an example of a class decorator (`@sealed`) applied to a `BugReport` class:



```id
ts@sealedclass BugReport {  type = "report";  title: string;   constructor(t: string) {    this.title = t;  }}Try
```



We can define the `@sealed` decorator using the following function declaration:



```id
tsfunction sealed(constructor: Function) {  Object.seal(constructor);  Object.seal(constructor.prototype);}
```



When `@sealed` is executed, it will seal both the constructor and its prototype, and will therefore prevent any further functionality from being added to or removed from this class during runtime by accessing `BugReport.prototype` or by defining properties on `BugReport` itself (note that ES2015 classes are really just syntactic sugar to prototype-based constructor functions). This decorator does not prevent classes from sub-classing `BugReport`.

Next we have an example of how to override the constructor to set new defaults.

 


```id
tsfunction (constructor: T): {
    new (...args: any[]): (Anonymous class);
    prototype: reportableClassDecorator<any>.(Anonymous class);
} & T' >reportableClassDecorator<(constructor: T): {
    new (...args: any[]): (Anonymous class);
    prototype: reportableClassDecorator<any>.(Anonymous class);
} & T' >T extends { new (...args: any[]): {} }>(constructor: (constructor: T): {
    new (...args: any[]): (Anonymous class);
    prototype: reportableClassDecorator<any>.(Anonymous class);
} & T' >T) {  return class extends constructor {    reportingURL = "http://www...";  };} @(constructor: T): {
    new (...args: any[]): (Anonymous class);
    prototype: reportableClassDecorator<any>.(Anonymous class);
} & T' >reportableClassDecoratorclass BugReport {  type = "report";  title: string;   constructor(t: string) {    this.title = t;  }} const bug = new BugReport("Needs dark mode");console.log(bug.title); // Prints "Needs dark mode"console.log(bug.type); // Prints "report" // Note that the decorator _does not_ change the TypeScript type// and so the new property `reportingURL` is not known// to the type system:bug.reportingURL;Property 'reportingURL' does not exist on type 'BugReport'.2339Property 'reportingURL' does not exist on type 'BugReport'.Try
```



## Method Decorators

A Method Decorator is declared just before a method declaration.
The decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the method, and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a method definition.
A method decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, on an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the method decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:

- Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.

- The name of the member.

- The Property Descriptor for the member.

 

NOTE  The Property Descriptor will be `undefined` if your script target is less than `ES5`.

 

If the method decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the method.

 

NOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than `ES5`.

 

The following is an example of a method decorator (`@enumerable`) applied to a method on the `Greeter` class:

 


```id
tsclass Greeter {  greeting: string;  constructor(message: string) {    this.greeting = message;  }   @ void' >enumerable(false)  greet() {    return "Hello, " + this.greeting;  }}Try
```



We can define the `@enumerable` decorator using the following function declaration:

 


```id
tsfunction  void' >enumerable(value: boolean) {  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {    descriptor.enumerable = value;  };}Try
```



The `@enumerable(false)` decorator here is a decorator factory .
When the `@enumerable(false)` decorator is called, it modifies the `enumerable` property of the property descriptor.

## Accessor Decorators

An Accessor Decorator is declared just before an accessor declaration.
The accessor decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the accessor and can be used to observe, modify, or replace an accessor’s definitions.
An accessor decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

 

NOTE  TypeScript disallows decorating both the `get` and `set` accessor for a single member.
Instead, all decorators for the member must be applied to the first accessor specified in document order.
This is because decorators apply to a Property Descriptor , which combines both the `get` and `set` accessor, not each declaration separately.

 

The expression for the accessor decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:

- Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.

- The name of the member.

- The Property Descriptor for the member.

 

NOTE  The Property Descriptor will be `undefined` if your script target is less than `ES5`.

 

If the accessor decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the member.

 

NOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than `ES5`.

 

The following is an example of an accessor decorator (`@configurable`) applied to a member of the `Point` class:



```id
tsclass Point {  private _x: number;  private _y: number;  constructor(x: number, y: number) {    this._x = x;    this._y = y;  }   @ void' >configurable(false)  get x() {    return this._x;  }   @ void' >configurable(false)  get y() {    return this._y;  }}Try
```



We can define the `@configurable` decorator using the following function declaration:

 


```id
tsfunction configurable(value: boolean) {  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {    descriptor.configurable = value;  };}
```



## Property Decorators

A Property Decorator is declared just before a property declaration.
A property decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the property decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following two arguments:

- Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.

- The name of the member.

 

NOTE  A Property Descriptor is not provided as an argument to a property decorator due to how property decorators are initialized in TypeScript.
This is because there is currently no mechanism to describe an instance property when defining members of a prototype, and no way to observe or modify the initializer for a property. The return value is ignored too.
As such, a property decorator can only be used to observe that a property of a specific name has been declared for a class.

 

We can use this information to record metadata about the property, as in the following example:



```id
tsclass Greeter {  @format("Hello, %s")  greeting: string;  constructor(message: string) {    this.greeting = message;  }  greet() {    let formatString = getFormat(this, "greeting");    return formatString.replace("%s", this.greeting);  }}
```



We can then define the `@format` decorator and `getFormat` functions using the following function declarations:



```id
tsimport "reflect-metadata";const formatMetadataKey = Symbol("format");function format(formatString: string) {  return Reflect.metadata(formatMetadataKey, formatString);}function getFormat(target: any, propertyKey: string) {  return Reflect.getMetadata(formatMetadataKey, target, propertyKey);}
```



The `@format("Hello, %s")` decorator here is a decorator factory .
When `@format("Hello, %s")` is called, it adds a metadata entry for the property using the `Reflect.metadata` function from the `reflect-metadata` library.
When `getFormat` is called, it reads the metadata value for the format.

 

NOTE  This example requires the `reflect-metadata` library.
See Metadata for more information about the `reflect-metadata` library.

 

## Parameter Decorators

A Parameter Decorator is declared just before a parameter declaration.
The parameter decorator is applied to the function for a class constructor or method declaration.
A parameter decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the parameter decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:

- Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.

- The name of the member.

- The ordinal index of the parameter in the function’s parameter list.

 

NOTE  A parameter decorator can only be used to observe that a parameter has been declared on a method.

 

The return value of the parameter decorator is ignored.

The following is an example of a parameter decorator (`@required`) applied to parameter of a member of the `BugReport` class:

 


```id
tsclass BugReport {  type = "report";  title: string;   constructor(t: string) {    this.title = t;  }   @): void' >validate  print(@required verbose: boolean) {    if (verbose) {      return `type: ${this.type}\ntitle: ${this.title}`;    } else {     return this.title;     }  }}Try
```



We can then define the `@required` and `@validate` decorators using the following function declarations:

 


```id
tsimport "reflect-metadata";const requiredMetadataKey =  symbol' >Symbol("required"); function required(target: Object, propertyKey: string | symbol, parameterIndex: number) {  let existingRequiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyKey) || [];  existingRequiredParameters..push(...items: number[]): number' >push(parameterIndex);  Reflect.defineMetadata( requiredMetadataKey, existingRequiredParameters, target, propertyKey);} function ): void' >validate(target: any, propertyName: string, ' >descriptor: ' >TypedPropertyDescriptor<Function>) {  let method = ' >descriptor..value?: Function | undefined' >value!;   ' >descriptor..value?: Function | undefined' >value = function () {    let requiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyName);    if (requiredParameters) {      for (let parameterIndex of requiredParameters) {        if (parameterIndex >= arguments.length || arguments[parameterIndex] === undefined) {          throw new  Error' >Error("Missing required argument.");        }      }    }    return method.apply(this, arguments);  };}Try
```



The `@required` decorator adds a metadata entry that marks the parameter as required.
The `@validate` decorator then wraps the existing `print` method in a function that validates the arguments before invoking the original method.

 

NOTE  This example requires the `reflect-metadata` library.
See Metadata for more information about the `reflect-metadata` library.

 

## Metadata

Some examples use the `reflect-metadata` library which adds a polyfill for an experimental metadata API .
This library is not yet part of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard.
However, once decorators are officially adopted as part of the ECMAScript standard these extensions will be proposed for adoption.

You can install this library via npm:



```id
shellnpm i reflect-metadata --save
```



TypeScript includes experimental support for emitting certain types of metadata for declarations that have decorators.
To enable this experimental support, you must set the `emitDecoratorMetadata` compiler option either on the command line or in your `tsconfig.json`:

 Command Line :



```id
shelltsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators --emitDecoratorMetadata
```



 tsconfig.json :



```
{  "compilerOptions": {    "target": "ES5",    "experimentalDecorators": true,    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true  }}
```



When enabled, as long as the `reflect-metadata` library has been imported, additional design-time type information will be exposed at runtime.

We can see this in action in the following example:

 


```id
tsimport "reflect-metadata"; class Point {  constructor(public x: number, public y: number) {}} class Line {  private _start: Point;  private _end: Point;   @(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >validate  set start(value: Point) {    this._start = value;  }   get start() {    return this._start;  }   @(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >validate  set end(value: Point) {    this._end = value;  }   get end() {    return this._end;  }} function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >validate<(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >T>(target: any, propertyKey: string, ' >descriptor: ' >TypedPropertyDescriptor<(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >T>) {  let  void' >set = ' >descriptor..set?: ((value: T) => void) | undefined' >set!;    ' >descriptor..set?: ((value: T) => void) | undefined' >set = function (value: (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >T) {    let type = Reflect.getMetadata("design:type", target, propertyKey);     if (!(value instanceof type)) {      throw new  TypeError (+1 overload)' >TypeError(`Invalid type, got ${typeof value} not ${type.name}.`);    }      void' >set., [T], void>(this: (this: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>, args_0: T) => void, thisArg: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>, args_0: T): void' >call(this, value);  };} const line = new Line()line.start = new Point(0, 0) // @ts-ignore// line.end = {} // Fails at runtime with:// > Invalid type, got object not Point Try
```



The TypeScript compiler will inject design-time type information using the `@Reflect.metadata` decorator.
You could consider it the equivalent of the following TypeScript:



```id
tsclass Line {  private _start: Point;  private _end: Point;  @validate  @Reflect.metadata("design:type", Point)  set start(value: Point) {    this._start = value;  }  get start() {    return this._start;  }  @validate  @Reflect.metadata("design:type", Point)  set end(value: Point) {    this._end = value;  }  get end() {    return this._end;  }}
```


 

NOTE  Decorator metadata is an experimental feature and may introduce breaking changes in future releases.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Declaration Merging

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - Declaration Merging 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Declaration Merging

 

## Introduction

Some of the unique concepts in TypeScript describe the shape of JavaScript objects at the type level.
One example that is especially unique to TypeScript is the concept of ‘declaration merging’.
Understanding this concept will give you an advantage when working with existing JavaScript.
It also opens the door to more advanced abstraction concepts.

For the purposes of this article, “declaration merging” means that the compiler merges two separate declarations declared with the same name into a single definition.
This merged definition has the features of both of the original declarations.
Any number of declarations can be merged; it’s not limited to just two declarations.

## Basic Concepts

In TypeScript, a declaration creates entities in at least one of three groups: namespace, type, or value.
Namespace-creating declarations create a namespace, which contains names that are accessed using a dotted notation.
Type-creating declarations do just that: they create a type that is visible with the declared shape and bound to the given name.
Lastly, value-creating declarations create values that are visible in the output JavaScript.

 
 
 
 Declaration Type 
 Namespace 
 Type 
 Value 
 
 
 
 
 Namespace 
 X 
 
 X 
 
 
 Class 
 
 X 
 X 
 
 
 Enum 
 
 X 
 X 
 
 
 Interface 
 
 X 
 
 
 
 Type Alias 
 
 X 
 
 
 
 Function 
 
 
 X 
 
 
 Variable 
 
 
 X 
 
 
 

Understanding what is created with each declaration will help you understand what is merged when you perform a declaration merge.

## Merging Interfaces

The simplest, and perhaps most common, type of declaration merging is interface merging.
At the most basic level, the merge mechanically joins the members of both declarations into a single interface with the same name.



```id
tsinterface Box {  height: number;  width: number;}interface Box {  scale: number;}let box: Box = { height: 5, width: 6, scale: 10 };
```



Non-function members of the interfaces should be unique.
If they are not unique, they must be of the same type.
The compiler will issue an error if the interfaces both declare a non-function member of the same name, but of different types.

For function members, each function member of the same name is treated as describing an overload of the same function.
Of note, too, is that in the case of interface `A` merging with later interface `A`, the second interface will have a higher precedence than the first.

That is, in the example:



```id
tsinterface Cloner {  clone(animal: Animal): Animal;}interface Cloner {  clone(animal: Sheep): Sheep;}interface Cloner {  clone(animal: Dog): Dog;  clone(animal: Cat): Cat;}
```



The three interfaces will merge to create a single declaration as so:



```id
tsinterface Cloner {  clone(animal: Dog): Dog;  clone(animal: Cat): Cat;  clone(animal: Sheep): Sheep;  clone(animal: Animal): Animal;}
```



Notice that the elements of each group maintains the same order, but the groups themselves are merged with later overload sets ordered first.

One exception to this rule is specialized signatures.
If a signature has a parameter whose type is a single string literal type (e.g. not a union of string literals), then it will be bubbled toward the top of its merged overload list.

For instance, the following interfaces will merge together:



```id
tsinterface Document {  createElement(tagName: any): Element;}interface Document {  createElement(tagName: "div"): HTMLDivElement;  createElement(tagName: "span"): HTMLSpanElement;}interface Document {  createElement(tagName: string): HTMLElement;  createElement(tagName: "canvas"): HTMLCanvasElement;}
```



The resulting merged declaration of `Document` will be the following:



```id
tsinterface Document {  createElement(tagName: "canvas"): HTMLCanvasElement;  createElement(tagName: "div"): HTMLDivElement;  createElement(tagName: "span"): HTMLSpanElement;  createElement(tagName: string): HTMLElement;  createElement(tagName: any): Element;}
```



## Merging Namespaces

Similarly to interfaces, namespaces of the same name will also merge their members.
Since namespaces create both a namespace and a value, we need to understand how both merge.

To merge the namespaces, type definitions from exported interfaces declared in each namespace are themselves merged, forming a single namespace with merged interface definitions inside.

To merge the namespace value, at each declaration site, if a namespace already exists with the given name, it is further extended by taking the existing namespace and adding the exported members of the second namespace to the first.

The declaration merge of `Animals` in this example:



```id
tsnamespace Animals {  export class Zebra {}}namespace Animals {  export interface Legged {    numberOfLegs: number;  }  export class Dog {}}
```



is equivalent to:



```id
tsnamespace Animals {  export interface Legged {    numberOfLegs: number;  }  export class Zebra {}  export class Dog {}}
```



This model of namespace merging is a helpful starting place, but we also need to understand what happens with non-exported members.
Non-exported members are only visible in the original (un-merged) namespace. This means that after merging, merged members that came from other declarations cannot see non-exported members.

We can see this more clearly in this example:



```id
tsnamespace Animal {  let haveMuscles = true;  export function animalsHaveMuscles() {    return haveMuscles;  }}namespace Animal {  export function doAnimalsHaveMuscles() {    return haveMuscles; // Error, because haveMuscles is not accessible here  }}
```



Because `haveMuscles` is not exported, only the `animalsHaveMuscles` function that shares the same un-merged namespace can see the symbol.
The `doAnimalsHaveMuscles` function, even though it’s part of the merged `Animal` namespace can not see this un-exported member.

## Merging Namespaces with Classes, Functions, and Enums

Namespaces are flexible enough to also merge with other types of declarations.
To do so, the namespace declaration must follow the declaration it will merge with. The resulting declaration has properties of both declaration types.
TypeScript uses this capability to model some of the patterns in JavaScript as well as other programming languages.

### Merging Namespaces with Classes

This gives the user a way of describing inner classes.



```id
tsclass Album {  label: Album.AlbumLabel;}namespace Album {  export class AlbumLabel {}}
```



The visibility rules for merged members is the same as described in the Merging Namespaces section, so we must export the `AlbumLabel` class for the merged class to see it.
The end result is a class managed inside of another class.
You can also use namespaces to add more static members to an existing class.

In addition to the pattern of inner classes, you may also be familiar with the JavaScript practice of creating a function and then extending the function further by adding properties onto the function.
TypeScript uses declaration merging to build up definitions like this in a type-safe way.



```id
tsfunction buildLabel(name: string): string {  return buildLabel.prefix + name + buildLabel.suffix;}namespace buildLabel {  export let suffix = "";  export let prefix = "Hello, ";}console.log(buildLabel("Sam Smith"));
```



Similarly, namespaces can be used to extend enums with static members:



```id
tsenum Color {  red = 1,  green = 2,  blue = 4,}namespace Color {  export function mixColor(colorName: string) {    if (colorName == "yellow") {      return Color.red + Color.green;    } else if (colorName == "white") {      return Color.red + Color.green + Color.blue;    } else if (colorName == "magenta") {      return Color.red + Color.blue;    } else if (colorName == "cyan") {      return Color.green + Color.blue;    }  }}
```



## Disallowed Merges

Not all merges are allowed in TypeScript.
Currently, classes can not merge with other classes or with variables.
For information on mimicking class merging, see the Mixins in TypeScript section.

## Module Augmentation

Although JavaScript modules do not support merging, you can patch existing objects by importing and then updating them.
Let’s look at a toy Observable example:



```id
ts// observable.tsexport class Observable<T> {  // ... implementation left as an exercise for the reader ...}// map.tsimport { Observable } from "./observable";Observable.prototype.map = function (f) {  // ... another exercise for the reader};
```



This works fine in TypeScript too, but the compiler doesn’t know about `Observable.prototype.map`.
You can use module augmentation to tell the compiler about it:



```id
ts// observable.tsexport class Observable<T> {  // ... implementation left as an exercise for the reader ...}// map.tsimport { Observable } from "./observable";declare module "./observable" {  interface Observable<T> {    map<U>(f: (x: T) => U): Observable<U>;  }}Observable.prototype.map = function (f) {  // ... another exercise for the reader};// consumer.tsimport { Observable } from "./observable";import "./map";let o: Observable<number>;o.map((x) => x.toFixed());
```



The module name is resolved the same way as module specifiers in `import`/`export`.
See Modules for more information.
Then the declarations in an augmentation are merged as if they were declared in the same file as the original.

However, there are two limitations to keep in mind:

 You can’t declare new top-level declarations in the augmentation — just patches to existing declarations.

- Default exports also cannot be augmented, only named exports (since you need to augment an export by its exported name, and `default` is a reserved word - see #14080 for details)

### Global augmentation

You can also add declarations to the global scope from inside a module:



```id
ts// observable.tsexport class Observable<T> {  // ... still no implementation ...}declare global {  interface Array<T> {    toObservable(): Observable<T>;  }}Array.prototype.toObservable = function () {  // ...};
```



Global augmentations have the same behavior and limits as module augmentations.

# Conditional Types

 

At the heart of most useful programs, we have to make decisions based on input.
JavaScript programs are no different, but given the fact that values can be easily introspected, those decisions are also based on the types of the inputs.
 Conditional types help describe the relation between the types of inputs and outputs.



```id
tsinterface Animal {  live(): void;}interface Dog extends Animal {  woof(): void;} type Example1 = Dog extends Animal ? number : string;        type Example1 = number type Example2 = RegExp extends Animal ? number : string;        type Example2 = stringTry
```



Conditional types take a form that looks a little like conditional expressions (`condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression`) in JavaScript:



```id
ts  SomeType extends OtherType ? TrueType : FalseType;Try
```



When the type on the left of the `extends` is assignable to the one on the right, then you’ll get the type in the first branch (the “true” branch); otherwise you’ll get the type in the latter branch (the “false” branch).

From the examples above, conditional types might not immediately seem useful - we can tell ourselves whether or not `Dog extends Animal` and pick `number` or `string`!
But the power of conditional types comes from using them with generics.

For example, let’s take the following `createLabel` function:



```id
tsinterface IdLabel {  id: number /* some fields */;}interface NameLabel {  name: string /* other fields */;} function createLabel(id: number): IdLabel;function createLabel(name: string): NameLabel;function createLabel(nameOrId: string | number): IdLabel | NameLabel;function createLabel(nameOrId: string | number): IdLabel | NameLabel {  throw "unimplemented";}Try
```



These overloads for createLabel describe a single JavaScript function that makes a choice based on the types of its inputs. Note a few things:

 If a library has to make the same sort of choice over and over throughout its API, this becomes cumbersome.

- We have to create three overloads: one for each case when we’re sure of the type (one for `string` and one for `number`), and one for the most general case (taking a `string | number`). For every new type `createLabel` can handle, the number of overloads grows exponentially.

Instead, we can encode that logic in a conditional type:



```id
tstype  = T extends number ? IdLabel : NameLabel' >NameOrId<' >T extends number | string> = ' >T extends number  ? IdLabel  : NameLabel;Try
```



We can then use that conditional type to simplify our overloads down to a single function with no overloads.



```id
tsfunction (idOrName: T): NameOrId<T>' >createLabel<(idOrName: T): NameOrId<T>' >T extends number | string>(idOrName: (idOrName: T): NameOrId<T>' >T):  = T extends number ? IdLabel : NameLabel' >NameOrId<(idOrName: T): NameOrId<T>' >T> {  throw "unimplemented";} let a = (idOrName: "typescript"): NameLabel' >createLabel("typescript");   let a: NameLabel let b = (idOrName: 2.8): IdLabel' >createLabel(2.8);   let b: IdLabel let c = (idOrName: "hello" | 42): IdLabel | NameLabel' >createLabel(Math.random() ? "hello" : 42);let c: NameLabel | IdLabelTry
```



### Conditional Type Constraints

Often, the checks in a conditional type will provide us with some new information.
Just like narrowing with type guards can give us a more specific type, the true branch of a conditional type will further constrain generics by the type we check against.

For example, let’s take the following:



```id
tstype  = T["message"]' >MessageOf<' >T> = ' >T["message"];Type '"message"' cannot be used to index type 'T'.2536Type '"message"' cannot be used to index type 'T'.Try
```



In this example, TypeScript errors because `T` isn’t known to have a property called `message`.
We could constrain `T`, and TypeScript would no longer complain:



```id
tstype  = T["message"]' >MessageOf<' >T extends { message: unknown }> = ' >T["message"]; interface Email {  message: string;} type EmailMessageContents =  = T["message"]' >MessageOf<Email>;              type EmailMessageContents = stringTry
```



However, what if we wanted `MessageOf` to take any type, and default to something like `never` if a `message` property isn’t available?
We can do this by moving the constraint out and introducing a conditional type:



```id
tstype  = T extends {
    message: unknown;
} ? T["message"] : never' >MessageOf<' >T> = ' >T extends { message: unknown } ? ' >T["message"] : never; interface Email {  message: string;} interface Dog {  bark(): void;} type EmailMessageContents =  = T extends {
    message: unknown;
} ? T["message"] : never' >MessageOf<Email>;              type EmailMessageContents = string type DogMessageContents =  = T extends {
    message: unknown;
} ? T["message"] : never' >MessageOf<Dog>;             type DogMessageContents = neverTry
```



Within the true branch, TypeScript knows that `T` will have a `message` property.

As another example, we could also write a type called `Flatten` that flattens array types to their element types, but leaves them alone otherwise:



```id
tstype  = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T' >Flatten<' >T> = ' >T extends any[] ? ' >T[number] : ' >T; // Extracts out the element type.type Str =  = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T' >Flatten<string[]>;     type Str = string // Leaves the type alone.type Num =  = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T' >Flatten<number>;     type Num = numberTry
```



When `Flatten` is given an array type, it uses an indexed access with `number` to fetch out `string[]`’s element type.
Otherwise, it just returns the type it was given.

### Inferring Within Conditional Types

We just found ourselves using conditional types to apply constraints and then extract out types.
This ends up being such a common operation that conditional types make it easier.

Conditional types provide us with a way to infer from types we compare against in the true branch using the `infer` keyword.
For example, we could have inferred the element type in `Flatten` instead of fetching it out “manually” with an indexed access type:



```id
tstype  = Type extends (infer Item)[] ? Item : Type' >Flatten<' >Type> = ' >Type extends ' >Array<infer Item> ? Item : ' >Type;Try
```



Here, we used the `infer` keyword to declaratively introduce a new generic type variable named `Item` instead of specifying how to retrieve the element type of `Type` within the true branch.
This frees us from having to think about how to dig through and probing apart the structure of the types we’re interested in.

We can write some useful helper type aliases using the `infer` keyword.
For example, for simple cases, we can extract the return type out from function types:



```id
tstype  = Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return ? Return : never' >GetReturnType<' >Type> = ' >Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return  ? Return  : never; type Num =  = Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return ? Return : never' >GetReturnType<() => number>;     type Num = number type Str =  = Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return ? Return : never' >GetReturnType<(x: string) => string>;     type Str = string type Bools =  = Type extends (...args: never[]) => infer Return ? Return : never' >GetReturnType<(a: boolean, b: boolean) => boolean[]>;      type Bools = boolean[]Try
```



When inferring from a type with multiple call signatures (such as the type of an overloaded function), inferences are made from the last signature (which, presumably, is the most permissive catch-all case). It is not possible to perform overload resolution based on a list of argument types.



```id
tsdeclare function stringOrNum(x: string): number;declare function stringOrNum(x: number): string;declare function stringOrNum(x: string | number): string | number; type T1 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<typeof stringOrNum>;     type T1 = string | numberTry
```



## Distributive Conditional Types

When conditional types act on a generic type, they become distributive when given a union type.
For example, take the following:



```id
tstype  = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<' >Type> = ' >Type extends any ? ' >Type[] : never;Try
```



If we plug a union type into `ToArray`, then the conditional type will be applied to each member of that union.



```id
tstype  = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<' >Type> = ' >Type extends any ? ' >Type[] : never; type StrArrOrNumArr =  = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<string | number>;           type StrArrOrNumArr = string[] | number[]Try
```



What happens here is that `ToArray` distributes on:



```id
ts  string | number;Try
```



and maps over each member type of the union, to what is effectively:



```id
ts   = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<string> |  = Type extends any ? Type[] : never' >ToArray<number>;Try
```



which leaves us with:



```id
ts  string[] | number[];Try
```



Typically, distributivity is the desired behavior.
To avoid that behavior, you can surround each side of the `extends` keyword with square brackets.



```id
tstype  = [Type] extends [any] ? Type[] : never' >ToArrayNonDist<' >Type> = [' >Type] extends [any] ? ' >Type[] : never; // &apos;ArrOfStrOrNum&apos; is no longer a union.type ArrOfStrOrNum =  = [Type] extends [any] ? Type[] : never' >ToArrayNonDist<string | number>;          type ArrOfStrOrNum = (string | number)[]Try
```

### TypeScript: Handbook - Enums

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html

- TypeScript: Handbook - Enums 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Enums

 

Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript.

Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants.
Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases.
TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

## Numeric enums

We’ll first start off with numeric enums, which are probably more familiar if you’re coming from other languages.
An enum can be defined using the `enum` keyword.



```id
tsenum Direction {  Up = 1,  Down,  Left,  Right,}Try
```



Above, we have a numeric enum where `Up` is initialized with `1`.
All of the following members are auto-incremented from that point on.
In other words, `Direction.Up` has the value `1`, `Down` has `2`, `Left` has `3`, and `Right` has `4`.

If we wanted, we could leave off the initializers entirely:



```id
tsenum Direction {  Up,  Down,  Left,  Right,}Try
```



Here, `Up` would have the value `0`, `Down` would have `1`, etc.
This auto-incrementing behavior is useful for cases where we might not care about the member values themselves, but do care that each value is distinct from other values in the same enum.

Using an enum is simple: just access any member as a property off of the enum itself, and declare types using the name of the enum:



```id
tsenum UserResponse {  No = 0,  Yes = 1,} function respond(recipient: string, message: UserResponse): void {  // ...} respond("Princess Caroline", UserResponse.Yes);Try
```



Numeric enums can be mixed in computed and constant members (see below) .
The short story is, enums without initializers either need to be first, or have to come after numeric enums initialized with numeric constants or other constant enum members.
In other words, the following isn’t allowed:



```id
tsenum E {  A =  number' >getSomeValue(),  B,Enum member must have initializer.1061Enum member must have initializer.}Try
```



## String enums

String enums are a similar concept, but have some subtle runtime differences as documented below.
In a string enum, each member has to be constant-initialized with a string literal, or with another string enum member.



```id
tsenum Direction {  Up = "UP",  Down = "DOWN",  Left = "LEFT",  Right = "RIGHT",}Try
```



While string enums don’t have auto-incrementing behavior, string enums have the benefit that they “serialize” well.
In other words, if you were debugging and had to read the runtime value of a numeric enum, the value is often opaque - it doesn’t convey any useful meaning on its own (though reverse mapping can often help). String enums allow you to give a meaningful and readable value when your code runs, independent of the name of the enum member itself.

## Heterogeneous enums

Technically enums can be mixed with string and numeric members, but it’s not clear why you would ever want to do so:



```id
tsenum BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum {  No = 0,  Yes = "YES",}Try
```



Unless you’re really trying to take advantage of JavaScript’s runtime behavior in a clever way, it’s advised that you don’t do this.

## Computed and constant members

Each enum member has a value associated with it which can be either constant or computed .
An enum member is considered constant if:

 

It is the first member in the enum and it has no initializer, in which case it’s assigned the value `0`:



```id
ts// E.X is constant:enum E {  X,}Try
```



- 

It does not have an initializer and the preceding enum member was a numeric constant.
In this case the value of the current enum member will be the value of the preceding enum member plus one.



```id
ts// All enum members in &apos;E1&apos; and &apos;E2&apos; are constant. enum E1 {  X,  Y,  Z,} enum E2 {  A = 1,  B,  C,}Try
```



- 

The enum member is initialized with a constant enum expression.
A constant enum expression is a subset of TypeScript expressions that can be fully evaluated at compile time.
An expression is a constant enum expression if it is:

 a literal enum expression (basically a string literal or a numeric literal)

- a reference to previously defined constant enum member (which can originate from a different enum)

- a parenthesized constant enum expression

- one of the `+`, `-`, `~` unary operators applied to constant enum expression

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, ` >`, `>>>`, `&`, `|`, `^` binary operators with constant enum expressions as operands

It is a compile time error for constant enum expressions to be evaluated to `NaN` or `Infinity`.

 

In all other cases enum member is considered computed.



```id
tsenum FileAccess {  // constant members  None,  Read = 1 << 1,  Write = 1 << 2,  ReadWrite = Read | Write,  // computed member  G = "123".length,}Try
```



## Union enums and enum member types

There is a special subset of constant enum members that aren’t calculated: literal enum members.
A literal enum member is a constant enum member with no initialized value, or with values that are initialized to

- any string literal (e.g. `"foo"`, `"bar"`, `"baz"`)

- any numeric literal (e.g. `1`, `100`)

- a unary minus applied to any numeric literal (e.g. `-1`, `-100`)

When all members in an enum have literal enum values, some special semantics come into play.

The first is that enum members also become types as well!
For example, we can say that certain members can only have the value of an enum member:



```id
tsenum ShapeKind {  Circle,  Square,} interface Circle {  kind: ShapeKind.Circle;  radius: number;} interface Square {  kind: ShapeKind.Square;  sideLength: number;} let c: Circle = {  kind: ShapeKind.Square,Type 'ShapeKind.Square' is not assignable to type 'ShapeKind.Circle'.2322Type 'ShapeKind.Square' is not assignable to type 'ShapeKind.Circle'.  radius: 100,};Try
```



The other change is that enum types themselves effectively become a union of each enum member.
With union enums, the type system is able to leverage the fact that it knows the exact set of values that exist in the enum itself.
Because of that, TypeScript can catch bugs where we might be comparing values incorrectly.
For example:



```id
tsenum E {  Foo,  Bar,} function f(x: E) {  if (x !== E.Foo || x !== E.Bar) {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'E.Foo' and 'E.Bar' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'E.Foo' and 'E.Bar' have no overlap.    //  }}Try
```



In that example, we first checked whether `x` was not `E.Foo`.
If that check succeeds, then our `||` will short-circuit, and the body of the ‘if’ will run.
However, if the check didn’t succeed, then `x` can only be `E.Foo`, so it doesn’t make sense to see whether it’s not equal to `E.Bar`.

## Enums at runtime

Enums are real objects that exist at runtime.
For example, the following enum



```id
tsenum E {  X,  Y,  Z,}Try
```



can actually be passed around to functions



```id
tsenum E {  X,  Y,  Z,} function f(obj: { X: number }) {  return obj.X;} // Works, since &apos;E&apos; has a property named &apos;X&apos; which is a number.f(E);Try
```



## Enums at compile time

Even though Enums are real objects that exist at runtime, the `keyof` keyword works differently than you might expect for typical objects. Instead, use `keyof typeof` to get a Type that represents all Enum keys as strings.



```id
tsenum LogLevel {  ERROR,  WARN,  INFO,  DEBUG,} /** * This is equivalent to: * type LogLevelStrings = &apos;ERROR&apos; | &apos;WARN&apos; | &apos;INFO&apos; | &apos;DEBUG&apos;; */type LogLevelStrings = keyof typeof LogLevel; function printImportant(key: LogLevelStrings, message: string) {  const num = LogLevel[key];  if (num <= LogLevel.WARN) {    console.log("Log level key is:", key);    console.log("Log level value is:", num);    console.log("Log level message is:", message);  }}printImportant("ERROR", "This is a message");Try
```



### Reverse mappings

In addition to creating an object with property names for members, numeric enums members also get a reverse mapping from enum values to enum names.
For example, in this example:



```id
tsenum Enum {  A,} let a = Enum.A;let nameOfA = Enum[a]; // "A"Try
```



TypeScript compiles this down to the following JavaScript:



```id
ts"use strict";var Enum;(function (Enum) {    Enum[Enum["A"] = 0] = "A";})(Enum || (Enum = {}));let a = Enum.A;let nameOfA = Enum[a]; // "A" Try
```



In this generated code, an enum is compiled into an object that stores both forward (`name` -> `value`) and reverse (`value` -> `name`) mappings.
References to other enum members are always emitted as property accesses and never inlined.

Keep in mind that string enum members do not get a reverse mapping generated at all.

### `const` enums

In most cases, enums are a perfectly valid solution.
However sometimes requirements are tighter.
To avoid paying the cost of extra generated code and additional indirection when accessing enum values, it’s possible to use `const` enums.
Const enums are defined using the `const` modifier on our enums:



```id
tsconst enum Enum {  A = 1,  B = A * 2,}Try
```



Const enums can only use constant enum expressions and unlike regular enums they are completely removed during compilation.
Const enum members are inlined at use sites.
This is possible since const enums cannot have computed members.



```id
tsconst enum Direction {  Up,  Down,  Left,  Right,} let directions = [  Direction.Up,  Direction.Down,  Direction.Left,  Direction.Right,];Try
```



in generated code will become



```id
ts"use strict";let directions = [    0 /* Direction.Up */,    1 /* Direction.Down */,    2 /* Direction.Left */,    3 /* Direction.Right */,]; Try
```



#### Const enum pitfalls

Inlining enum values is straightforward at first, but comes with subtle implications.
These pitfalls pertain to ambient const enums only (basically const enums in `.d.ts` files) and sharing them between projects, but if you are publishing or consuming `.d.ts` files, these pitfalls likely apply to you, because `tsc --declaration` transforms `.ts` files into `.d.ts` files.

- For the reasons laid out in the `isolatedModules` documentation , that mode is fundamentally incompatible with ambient const enums.
This means if you publish ambient const enums, downstream consumers will not be able to use `isolatedModules` and those enum values at the same time.

- You can easily inline values from version A of a dependency at compile time, and import version B at runtime.
Version A and B’s enums can have different values, if you are not very careful, resulting in surprising bugs , like taking the wrong branches of `if` statements.
These bugs are especially pernicious because it is common to run automated tests at roughly the same time as projects are built, with the same dependency versions, which misses these bugs completely.

- `importsNotUsedAsValues: "preserve"` will not elide imports for const enums used as values, but ambient const enums do not guarantee that runtime `.js` files exist.
The unresolvable imports cause errors at runtime.
The usual way to unambiguously elide imports, type-only imports , does not allow const enum values , currently.

Here are two approaches to avoiding these pitfalls:

- 

Do not use const enums at all.
You can easily ban const enums with the help of a linter.
Obviously this avoids any issues with const enums, but prevents your project from inlining its own enums.
Unlike inlining enums from other projects, inlining a project’s own enums is not problematic and has performance implications.

- 

Do not publish ambient const enums, by deconstifying them with the help of `preserveConstEnums` .
This is the approach taken internally by the TypeScript project itself .
 `preserveConstEnums` emits the same JavaScript for const enums as plain enums.
You can then safely strip the `const` modifier from `.d.ts` files in a build step .

This way downstream consumers will not inline enums from your project, avoiding the pitfalls above, but a project can still inline its own enums, unlike banning const enums entirely.

## Ambient enums

Ambient enums are used to describe the shape of already existing enum types.



```id
tsdeclare enum Enum {  A = 1,  B,  C = 2,}Try
```



One important difference between ambient and non-ambient enums is that, in regular enums, members that don’t have an initializer will be considered constant if its preceding enum member is considered constant.
By contrast, an ambient (and non-const) enum member that does not have an initializer is always considered computed.

## Objects vs Enums

In modern TypeScript, you may not need an enum when an object with `as const` could suffice:



```id
tsconst enum EDirection {  Up,  Down,  Left,  Right,} const ODirection = {  Up: 0,  Down: 1,  Left: 2,  Right: 3,} as const; EDirection.Up;           (enum member) EDirection.Up = 0 ODirection.Up;           (property) Up: 0 // Using the enum as a parameterfunction walk(dir: EDirection) {} // It requires an extra line to pull out the valuestype Direction = typeof ODirection[keyof typeof ODirection];function run(dir: Direction) {} walk(EDirection.Left);run(ODirection.Right);Try
```



The biggest argument in favour of this format over TypeScript’s `enum` is that it keeps your codebase aligned with the state of JavaScript, and when/if enums are added to JavaScript then you can move to the additional syntax.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Mapped Types

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html#handbook-content

TypeScript: Documentation - Mapped Types 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Mapped Types

 

When you don’t want to repeat yourself, sometimes a type needs to be based on another type.

Mapped types build on the syntax for index signatures, which are used to declare the types of properties which have not been declared ahead of time:



```id
tstype OnlyBoolsAndHorses = {  [key: string]: boolean | Horse;}; const conforms: OnlyBoolsAndHorses = {  del: true,  rodney: false,};Try
```



A mapped type is a generic type which uses a union of `PropertyKey`s (frequently created via a `keyof` ) to iterate through keys to create a type:



```id
tstype  = { [Property in keyof Type]: boolean; }' >OptionsFlags<' >Type> = {  [Property in keyof ' >Type]: boolean;};Try
```



In this example, `OptionsFlags` will take all the properties from the type `Type` and change their values to be a boolean.



```id
tstype  void;
    newUserProfile: () => void;
}' >Features = {   void' >darkMode: () => void;   void' >newUserProfile: () => void;}; type FeatureOptions =  = { [Property in keyof Type]: boolean; }' >OptionsFlags< void;
    newUserProfile: () => void;
}' >Features>;           type FeatureOptions = {
    darkMode: boolean;
    newUserProfile: boolean;
}Try
```



### Mapping Modifiers

There are two additional modifiers which can be applied during mapping: `readonly` and `?` which affect mutability and optionality respectively.

You can remove or add these modifiers by prefixing with `-` or `+`. If you don’t add a prefix, then `+` is assumed.



```id
ts// Removes &apos;readonly&apos; attributes from a type&apos;s propertiestype  = { -readonly [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property]; }' >CreateMutable<' >Type> = {  -readonly [Property in keyof ' >Type]: ' >Type[Property];}; type LockedAccount = {  readonly id: string;  readonly name: string;}; type UnlockedAccount =  = { -readonly [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property]; }' >CreateMutable<LockedAccount>;           type UnlockedAccount = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
}Try
```




```id
ts// Removes &apos;optional&apos; attributes from a type&apos;s propertiestype  = { [Property in keyof Type]-?: Type[Property]; }' >Concrete<' >Type> = {  [Property in keyof ' >Type]-?: ' >Type[Property];}; type MaybeUser = {  id: string;  name?: string;  age?: number;}; type User =  = { [Property in keyof Type]-?: Type[Property]; }' >Concrete<MaybeUser>;      type User = {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;
}Try
```



## Key Remapping via `as`

In TypeScript 4.1 and onwards, you can re-map keys in mapped types with an `as` clause in a mapped type:



```id
tstype MappedTypeWithNewProperties<Type> = {    [Properties in keyof Type as NewKeyType]: Type[Properties]}
```



You can leverage features like template literal types to create new property names from prior ones:



```id
tstype  = { [Property in keyof Type as `get${Capitalize<string & Property>}`]: () => Type[Property]; }' >Getters<' >Type> = {    [Property in keyof ' >Type as `get${ = intrinsic' >Capitalize<string & Property>}`]: () => ' >Type[Property]}; interface Person {    name: string;    age: number;    location: string;} type  string;
    getAge: () => number;
    getLocation: () => string;
}' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>LazyPerson =  = { [Property in keyof Type as `get${Capitalize<string & Property>}`]: () => Type[Property]; }' >Getters<Person>;         type LazyPerson = {
    getName: () => string;
    getAge: () => number;
    getLocation: () => string;
}Try
```



You can filter out keys by producing `never` via a conditional type:



```id
ts// Remove the &apos;kind&apos; propertytype  = { [Property in keyof Type as Exclude<Property, "kind">]: Type[Property]; }' >RemoveKindField<' >Type> = {    [Property in keyof ' >Type as  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<Property, "kind">]: ' >Type[Property]}; interface Circle {    kind: "circle";    radius: number;} type KindlessCircle =  = { [Property in keyof Type as Exclude<Property, "kind">]: Type[Property]; }' >RemoveKindField<Circle>;           type KindlessCircle = {
    radius: number;
}Try
```



You can map over arbitrary unions, not just unions of `string | number | symbol`, but unions of any type:



```id
tstype  = { [E in Events as E["kind"]]: (event: E) => void; }' >EventConfig<' >Events extends { kind: string }> = {    [E in ' >Events as E["kind"]]: (event: E) => void;} type SquareEvent = { kind: "square", x: number, y: number };type CircleEvent = { kind: "circle", radius: number }; type  void;
    circle: (event: CircleEvent) => void;
}' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>Config =  = { [E in Events as E["kind"]]: (event: E) => void; }' >EventConfig<SquareEvent | CircleEvent>       type Config = {
    square: (event: SquareEvent) => void;
    circle: (event: CircleEvent) => void;
}Try
```



### Further Exploration

Mapped types work well with other features in this type manipulation section, for example here is a mapped type using a conditional type which returns either a `true` or `false` depending on whether an object has the property `pii` set to the literal `true`:



```id
tstype  = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends {
    pii: true;
} ? true : false; }' >ExtractPII<' >Type> = {  [Property in keyof ' >Type]: ' >Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false;}; type DBFields = {  id: { format: "incrementing" };  name: { type: string; pii: true };}; type ObjectsNeedingGDPRDeletion =  = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends {
    pii: true;
} ? true : false; }' >ExtractPII<DBFields>;                 type ObjectsNeedingGDPRDeletion = {
    id: false;
    name: true;
}Try
```

# Iterators and Generators

 

## Iterables

An object is deemed iterable if it has an implementation for the `Symbol.iterator` property.
Some built-in types like `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `String`, `Int32Array`, `Uint32Array`, etc. have their `Symbol.iterator` property already implemented.
`Symbol.iterator` function on an object is responsible for returning the list of values to iterate on.

### `Iterable` interface

`Iterable` is a type we can use if we want to take in types listed above which are iterable. Here is an example:



```id
tsfunction toArray<X>(xs: Iterable<X>): X[] {  return [...xs]}
```



### `for..of` statements

`for..of` loops over an iterable object, invoking the `Symbol.iterator` property on the object.
Here is a simple `for..of` loop on an array:



```id
tslet someArray = [1, "string", false];for (let entry of someArray) {  console.log(entry); // 1, "string", false}
```



### `for..of` vs. `for..in` statements

Both `for..of` and `for..in` statements iterate over lists; the values iterated on are different though, `for..in` returns a list of keys on the object being iterated, whereas `for..of` returns a list of values of the numeric properties of the object being iterated.

Here is an example that demonstrates this distinction:



```id
tslet list = [4, 5, 6];for (let i in list) {  console.log(i); // "0", "1", "2",}for (let i of list) {  console.log(i); // 4, 5, 6}
```



Another distinction is that `for..in` operates on any object; it serves as a way to inspect properties on this object.
`for..of` on the other hand, is mainly interested in values of iterable objects. Built-in objects like `Map` and `Set` implement `Symbol.iterator` property allowing access to stored values.



```id
tslet pets = new Set(["Cat", "Dog", "Hamster"]);pets["species"] = "mammals";for (let pet in pets) {  console.log(pet); // "species"}for (let pet of pets) {  console.log(pet); // "Cat", "Dog", "Hamster"}
```



### Code generation

#### Targeting ES5

When targeting an ES5-compliant engine, iterators are only allowed on values of `Array` type.
It is an error to use `for..of` loops on non-Array values, even if these non-Array values implement the `Symbol.iterator` property.

The compiler will generate a simple `for` loop for a `for..of` loop, for instance:



```id
tslet numbers = [1, 2, 3];for (let num of numbers) {  console.log(num);}
```



will be generated as:



```id
jsvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];for (var _i = 0; _i < numbers.length; _i++) {  var num = numbers[_i];  console.log(num);}
```



#### Targeting ECMAScript 2015 and higher

When targeting an ECMAScript 2015-compliant engine, the compiler will generate `for..of` loops to target the built-in iterator implementation in the engine.

# Template Literal Types

 

Template literal types build on string literal types , and have the ability to expand into many strings via unions.

They have the same syntax as template literal strings in JavaScript , but are used in type positions.
When used with concrete literal types, a template literal produces a new string literal type by concatenating the contents.



```id
tstype World = "world"; type Greeting = `hello ${World}`;        type Greeting = "hello world"Try
```



When a union is used in the interpolated position, the type is the set of every possible string literal that could be represented by each union member:



```id
tstype EmailLocaleIDs = "welcome_email" | "email_heading";type FooterLocaleIDs = "footer_title" | "footer_sendoff"; type AllLocaleIDs = `${EmailLocaleIDs | FooterLocaleIDs}_id`;          type AllLocaleIDs = "welcome_email_id" | "email_heading_id" | "footer_title_id" | "footer_sendoff_id"Try
```



For each interpolated position in the template literal, the unions are cross multiplied:



```id
tstype AllLocaleIDs = `${EmailLocaleIDs | FooterLocaleIDs}_id`;type Lang = "en" | "ja" | "pt"; type LocaleMessageIDs = `${Lang}_${AllLocaleIDs}`;            type LocaleMessageIDs = "en_welcome_email_id" | "en_email_heading_id" | "en_footer_title_id" | "en_footer_sendoff_id" | "ja_welcome_email_id" | "ja_email_heading_id" | "ja_footer_title_id" | "ja_footer_sendoff_id" | "pt_welcome_email_id" | "pt_email_heading_id" | "pt_footer_title_id" | "pt_footer_sendoff_id"Try
```



We generally recommend that people use ahead-of-time generation for large string unions, but this is useful in smaller cases.

### String Unions in Types

The power in template literals comes when defining a new string based on information inside a type.

Consider the case where a function (`makeWatchedObject`) adds a new function
called `on()` to a passed object. In JavaScript, its call might look like:
`makeWatchedObject(baseObject)`. We can imagine the base object as looking
like:



```id
tsconst passedObject = {  firstName: "Saoirse",  lastName: "Ronan",  age: 26,};Try
```



The `on` function that will be added to the base object expects two arguments, an `eventName` (a `string`) and a `callback` (a `function`).

The `eventName` should be of the form `attributeInThePassedObject + "Changed"`; thus, `firstNameChanged` as derived from the attribute `firstName` in the base object.

The `callback` function, when called:

 Should be passed a value of the type associated with the name `attributeInThePassedObject`; thus, since `firstName` is typed as `string`, the callback for the `firstNameChanged` event expects a `string` to be passed to it at call time. Similarly events associated with `age` should expect to be called with a `number` argument

- Should have `void` return type (for simplicity of demonstration)

The naive function signature of `on()` might thus be: 

```
on(eventName: string, callback: (newValue: any) => void)
```

. However, in the preceding description, we identified important type constraints that we’d like to document in our code. Template Literal types let us bring these constraints into our code.



```id
tsconst person = makeWatchedObject({  firstName: "Saoirse",  lastName: "Ronan",  age: 26,}); // makeWatchedObject has added `on` to the anonymous Object person.on("firstNameChanged", (newValue) => {  console.log(`firstName was changed to ${newValue}!`);});Try
```



Notice that `on` listens on the event `"firstNameChanged"`, not just `"firstName"`. Our naive specification of `on()` could be made more robust if we were to ensure that the set of eligible event names was constrained by the union of attribute names in the watched object with “Changed” added at the end. While we are comfortable with doing such a calculation in JavaScript i.e. `Object.keys(passedObject).map(x => `${x}Changed`)`, template literals inside the type system provide a similar approach to string manipulation:



```id
tstype  = {
    on(eventName: `${string & keyof Type}Changed`, callback: (newValue: any) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<' >Type> = {     void): void' >on(eventName: `${string & keyof ' >Type}Changed`,  void' >callback: (newValue: any) => void): void;}; /// Create a "watched object" with an `on` method/// so that you can watch for changes to properties.declare function (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >makeWatchedObject<(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type>(obj: (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type): (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type &  = {
    on(eventName: `${string & keyof Type}Changed`, callback: (newValue: any) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type>;Try
```



With this, we can build something that errors when given the wrong property:



```id
tsconst ' >person = (obj: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}): {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
} & PropEventSource<{
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}>' >makeWatchedObject({  firstName: "Saoirse",  lastName: "Ronan",  age: 26}); ' >person. void): void' >on("firstNameChanged", () => {}); // Prevent easy human error (using the key instead of the event name)' >person. void): void' >on("firstName", () => {});Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'.2345Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'. // It&apos;s typo-resistant' >person. void): void' >on("frstNameChanged", () => {});Argument of type '"frstNameChanged"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'.2345Argument of type '"frstNameChanged"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'.Try
```



### Inference with Template Literals

Notice that we did not benefit from all the information provided in the original passed object. Given change of a `firstName` (i.e. a `firstNameChanged` event), we should expect that the callback will receive an argument of type `string`. Similarly, the callback for a change to `age` should receive a `number` argument. We’re naively using `any` to type the `callback`’s argument. Again, template literal types make it possible to ensure an attribute’s data type will be the same type as that attribute’s callback’s first argument.

The key insight that makes this possible is this: we can use a function with a generic such that:

- The literal used in the first argument is captured as a literal type

- That literal type can be validated as being in the union of valid attributes in the generic

- The type of the validated attribute can be looked up in the generic’s structure using Indexed Access

- This typing information can then be applied to ensure the argument to the
callback function is of the same type



```id
tstype  = {
    on<Key extends string & keyof Type>(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<' >Type> = {    (eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void' >on<(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void' >Key extends string & keyof ' >Type>        (eventName: `${(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void' >Key}Changed`,  void' >callback: (newValue: ' >Type[(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void' >Key]) => void): void;}; declare function (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >makeWatchedObject<(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type>(obj: (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type): (obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type &  = {
    on<Key extends string & keyof Type>(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>' >Type>; const ' >person = (obj: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}): {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
} & PropEventSource<{
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}>' >makeWatchedObject({  firstName: "Saoirse",  lastName: "Ronan",  age: 26}); ' >person.(eventName: "firstNameChanged", callback: (newValue: string) => void): void' >on("firstNameChanged", newName => {                                (parameter) newName: string    console.log(`new name is ${newName.toUpperCase()}`);}); ' >person.(eventName: "ageChanged", callback: (newValue: number) => void): void' >on("ageChanged", newAge => {                          (parameter) newAge: number    if (newAge < 0) {        console.warn("warning! negative age");    }})Try
```



Here we made `on` into a generic method.

When a user calls with the string `"firstNameChanged"`, TypeScript will try to infer the right type for `Key`.
To do that, it will match `Key` against the content before `"Changed"` and infer the string `"firstName"`.
Once TypeScript figures that out, the `on` method can fetch the type of `firstName` on the original object, which is `string` in this case.
Similarly, when called with `"ageChanged"`, TypeScript finds the type for the property `age` which is `number`.

Inference can be combined in different ways, often to deconstruct strings, and reconstruct them in different ways.

## Intrinsic String Manipulation Types

To help with string manipulation, TypeScript includes a set of types which can be used in string manipulation. These types come built-in to the compiler for performance and can’t be found in the `.d.ts` files included with TypeScript.

### `Uppercase `

Converts each character in the string to the uppercase version.

 Example 


```id
tstype Greeting = "Hello, world"type ShoutyGreeting =  = intrinsic' >Uppercase<Greeting>           type ShoutyGreeting = "HELLO, WORLD" type  = `ID-${Uppercase<Str>}`' >ASCIICacheKey<' >Str extends string> = `ID-${ = intrinsic' >Uppercase<' >Str>}`type MainID =  = `ID-${Uppercase<Str>}`' >ASCIICacheKey<"my_app">       type MainID = "ID-MY_APP"Try
```



### `Lowercase `

Converts each character in the string to the lowercase equivalent.

 Example 


```id
tstype Greeting = "Hello, world"type QuietGreeting =  = intrinsic' >Lowercase<Greeting>          type QuietGreeting = "hello, world" type  = `id-${Lowercase<Str>}`' >ASCIICacheKey<' >Str extends string> = `id-${ = intrinsic' >Lowercase<' >Str>}`type MainID =  = `id-${Lowercase<Str>}`' >ASCIICacheKey<"MY_APP">       type MainID = "id-my_app"Try
```



### `Capitalize `

Converts the first character in the string to an uppercase equivalent.

 Example 


```id
tstype LowercaseGreeting = "hello, world";type Greeting =  = intrinsic' >Capitalize<LowercaseGreeting>;        type Greeting = "Hello, world"Try
```



### `Uncapitalize `

Converts the first character in the string to a lowercase equivalent.

 Example 


```id
tstype UppercaseGreeting = "HELLO WORLD";type UncomfortableGreeting =  = intrinsic' >Uncapitalize<UppercaseGreeting>;              type UncomfortableGreeting = "hELLO WORLD"Try
```


 
 Technical details on the intrinsic string manipulation types 
 

The code, as of TypeScript 4.1, for these intrinsic functions uses the JavaScript string runtime functions directly for manipulation and are not locale aware.

 `

```
function applyStringMapping(symbol: Symbol, str: string) {
    switch (intrinsicTypeKinds.get(symbol.escapedName as string)) {
        case IntrinsicTypeKind.Uppercase: return str.toUpperCase();
        case IntrinsicTypeKind.Lowercase: return str.toLowerCase();
        case IntrinsicTypeKind.Capitalize: return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
        case IntrinsicTypeKind.Uncapitalize: return str.charAt(0).toLowerCase() + str.slice(1);
    }
    return str;
}
```

`

### TypeScript: Documentation - JSX

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - JSX 

Was this page helpful?

 

# JSX

 

 JSX is an embeddable XML-like syntax.
It is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript, though the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific.
JSX rose to popularity with the React framework, but has since seen other implementations as well.
TypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and compiling JSX directly to JavaScript.

## Basic usage

In order to use JSX you must do two things.

 Name your files with a `.tsx` extension

- Enable the `jsx` option

TypeScript ships with several JSX modes: `preserve`, `react` (classic runtime), `react-jsx` (automatic runtime), `react-jsxdev` (automatic development runtime), and `react-native`.
The `preserve` mode will keep the JSX as part of the output to be further consumed by another transform step (e.g. Babel ).
Additionally the output will have a `.jsx` file extension.
The `react` mode will emit `React.createElement`, does not need to go through a JSX transformation before use, and the output will have a `.js` file extension.
The `react-native` mode is the equivalent of `preserve` in that it keeps all JSX, but the output will instead have a `.js` file extension.

 
 
 
 Mode 
 Input 
 Output 
 Output File Extension 
 
 
 
 
 `preserve` 
 ` ` 
 ` ` 
 `.jsx` 
 
 
 `react` 
 ` ` 
 `React.createElement("div")` 
 `.js` 
 
 
 `react-native` 
 ` ` 
 ` ` 
 `.js` 
 
 
 `react-jsx` 
 ` ` 
 `_jsx("div", {}, void 0);` 
 `.js` 
 
 
 `react-jsxdev` 
 ` ` 
 `_jsxDEV("div", {}, void 0, false, {...}, this);` 
 `.js` 
 
 
 

You can specify this mode using either the `jsx` command line flag or the corresponding option `jsx` in your tsconfig.json file.

 

*Note: You can specify the JSX factory function to use when targeting react JSX emit with `jsxFactory` option (defaults to `React.createElement`)

 

## The `as` operator

Recall how to write a type assertion:



```id
tsconst foo = <Foo>bar;
```



This asserts the variable `bar` to have the type `Foo`.
Since TypeScript also uses angle brackets for type assertions, combining it with JSX’s syntax would introduce certain parsing difficulties. As a result, TypeScript disallows angle bracket type assertions in `.tsx` files.

Since the above syntax cannot be used in `.tsx` files, an alternate type assertion operator should be used: `as`.
The example can easily be rewritten with the `as` operator.



```id
tsconst foo = bar as Foo;
```



The `as` operator is available in both `.ts` and `.tsx` files, and is identical in behavior to the angle-bracket type assertion style.

## Type Checking

In order to understand type checking with JSX, you must first understand the difference between intrinsic elements and value-based elements.
Given a JSX expression ` `, `expr` may either refer to something intrinsic to the environment (e.g. a `div` or `span` in a DOM environment) or to a custom component that you’ve created.
This is important for two reasons:

- For React, intrinsic elements are emitted as strings (`React.createElement("div")`), whereas a component you’ve created is not (`React.createElement(MyComponent)`).

- The types of the attributes being passed in the JSX element should be looked up differently.
Intrinsic element attributes should be known intrinsically whereas components will likely want to specify their own set of attributes.

TypeScript uses the same convention that React does for distinguishing between these.
An intrinsic element always begins with a lowercase letter, and a value-based element always begins with an uppercase letter.

### The `JSX` namespace

JSX in TypeScript is typed by the `JSX` namespace. The `JSX` namespace may be defined in various places, depending on the `jsx` compiler option.

The `jsx` options `preserve`, `react`, and `react-native` use the type definitions for classic runtime. This means a variable needs to be in scope that’s determined by the `jsxFactory` compiler option. The `JSX` namespace should be specified on the top-most identifier of the JSX factory. For example, React uses the default factory `React.createElement`. This means its `JSX` namespace should be defined as `React.JSX`.



```id
tsexport function createElement(): any;export namespace JSX {  // …}
```



And the user should always import React as `React`.



```id
tsimport * as React from 'react';
```



Preact uses the JSX factory `h`. That means its types should be defined as the `h.JSX`.



```id
tsexport function h(props: any): any;export namespace h.JSX {  // …}
```



The user should use a named import to import `h`.



```id
tsimport { h } from 'preact';
```



For the `jsx` options `react-jsx` and `react-jsxdev`, the `JSX` namespace should be exported from the matching entry points. For `react-jsx` this is `${jsxImportSource}/jsx-runtime`. For `react-jsxdev`, this is `${jsxImportSource}/jsx-dev-runtime`. Since these don’t use a file extension, you must use the `exports` field in `package.json` map in order to support ESM users.



```id
json{  "exports": {    "./jsx-runtime": "./jsx-runtime.js",    "./jsx-dev-runtime": "./jsx-dev-runtime.js",  }}
```



Then in `jsx-runtime.d.ts` and `jsx-dev-runtime.d.ts`:



```id
tsexport namespace JSX {  // …}
```



Note that while exporting the `JSX` namespace is sufficient for type checking, the production runtime needs the `jsx`, `jsxs`, and `Fragment` exports at runtime, and the development runtime needs `jsxDEV` and `Fragment`. Ideally you add types for those too.

If the `JSX` namespace isn’t available in the appropriate location, both the classic and the automatic runtime fall back to the global `JSX` namespace.

### Intrinsic elements

Intrinsic elements are looked up on the special interface `JSX.IntrinsicElements`.
By default, if this interface is not specified, then anything goes and intrinsic elements will not be type checked.
However, if this interface is present, then the name of the intrinsic element is looked up as a property on the `JSX.IntrinsicElements` interface.
For example:



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface IntrinsicElements {    foo: any;  }}<foo />; // ok<bar />; // error
```



In the above example, ` ` will work fine but ` ` will result in an error since it has not been specified on `JSX.IntrinsicElements`.

 

Note: You can also specify a catch-all string indexer on `JSX.IntrinsicElements` as follows:

 


```id
tsdeclare namespace JSX {  interface IntrinsicElements {    [elemName: string]: any;  }}
```



### Value-based elements

Value-based elements are simply looked up by identifiers that are in scope.



```id
tsximport MyComponent from "./myComponent";<MyComponent />; // ok<SomeOtherComponent />; // error
```



There are two ways to define a value-based element:

- Function Component (FC)

- Class Component

Because these two types of value-based elements are indistinguishable from each other in a JSX expression, first TS tries to resolve the expression as a Function Component using overload resolution. If the process succeeds, then TS finishes resolving the expression to its declaration. If the value fails to resolve as a Function Component, TS will then try to resolve it as a class component. If that fails, TS will report an error.

#### Function Component

As the name suggests, the component is defined as a JavaScript function where its first argument is a `props` object.
TS enforces that its return type must be assignable to `JSX.Element`.



```id
tsxinterface FooProp {  name: string;  X: number;  Y: number;}declare function AnotherComponent(prop: { name: string });function ComponentFoo(prop: FooProp) {  return <AnotherComponent name={prop.name} />;}const Button = (prop: { value: string }, context: { color: string }) => (  <button />);
```



Because a Function Component is simply a JavaScript function, function overloads may be used here as well:



```id
tsinterface ClickableProps {  children: JSX.Element[] | JSX.Element;} interface HomeProps extends ClickableProps {  home: JSX.Element;} interface SideProps extends ClickableProps {  side: JSX.Element | string;} function MainButton(prop: HomeProps): JSX.Element;function MainButton(prop: SideProps): JSX.Element;function MainButton(prop: ClickableProps): JSX.Element {  // ...}Try
```


 

Note: Function Components were formerly known as Stateless Function Components (SFC). As Function Components can no longer be considered stateless in recent versions of react, the type `SFC` and its alias `StatelessComponent` were deprecated.

 

#### Class Component

It is possible to define the type of a class component.
However, to do so it is best to understand two new terms: the element class type and the element instance type .

Given ` `, the element class type is the type of `Expr`.
So in the example above, if `MyComponent` was an ES6 class the class type would be that class’s constructor and statics.
If `MyComponent` was a factory function, the class type would be that function.

Once the class type is established, the instance type is determined by the union of the return types of the class type’s construct or call signatures (whichever is present).
So again, in the case of an ES6 class, the instance type would be the type of an instance of that class, and in the case of a factory function, it would be the type of the value returned from the function.



```id
tsclass MyComponent {  render() {}}// use a construct signatureconst myComponent = new MyComponent();// element class type => MyComponent// element instance type => { render: () => void }function MyFactoryFunction() {  return {    render: () => {},  };}// use a call signatureconst myComponent = MyFactoryFunction();// element class type => MyFactoryFunction// element instance type => { render: () => void }
```



The element instance type is interesting because it must be assignable to `JSX.ElementClass` or it will result in an error.
By default `JSX.ElementClass` is `{}`, but it can be augmented to limit the use of JSX to only those types that conform to the proper interface.



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface ElementClass {    render: any;  }}class MyComponent {  render() {}}function MyFactoryFunction() {  return { render: () => {} };}<MyComponent />; // ok<MyFactoryFunction />; // okclass NotAValidComponent {}function NotAValidFactoryFunction() {  return {};}<NotAValidComponent />; // error<NotAValidFactoryFunction />; // error
```



### Attribute type checking

The first step to type checking attributes is to determine the element attributes type .
This is slightly different between intrinsic and value-based elements.

For intrinsic elements, it is the type of the property on `JSX.IntrinsicElements`



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface IntrinsicElements {    foo: { bar?: boolean };  }}// element attributes type for 'foo' is '{bar?: boolean}'<foo bar />;
```



For value-based elements, it is a bit more complex.
It is determined by the type of a property on the element instance type that was previously determined.
Which property to use is determined by `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty`.
It should be declared with a single property.
The name of that property is then used.
As of TypeScript 2.8, if `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty` is not provided, the type of first parameter of the class element’s constructor or Function Component’s call will be used instead.



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface ElementAttributesProperty {    props; // specify the property name to use  }}class MyComponent {  // specify the property on the element instance type  props: {    foo?: string;  };}// element attributes type for 'MyComponent' is '{foo?: string}'<MyComponent foo="bar" />;
```



The element attribute type is used to type check the attributes in the JSX.
Optional and required properties are supported.



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface IntrinsicElements {    foo: { requiredProp: string; optionalProp?: number };  }}<foo requiredProp="bar" />; // ok<foo requiredProp="bar" optionalProp={0} />; // ok<foo />; // error, requiredProp is missing<foo requiredProp={0} />; // error, requiredProp should be a string<foo requiredProp="bar" unknownProp />; // error, unknownProp does not exist<foo requiredProp="bar" some-unknown-prop />; // ok, because 'some-unknown-prop' is not a valid identifier
```


 

Note: If an attribute name is not a valid JS identifier (like a `data-*` attribute), it is not considered to be an error if it is not found in the element attributes type.

 

Additionally, the `JSX.IntrinsicAttributes` interface can be used to specify extra properties used by the JSX framework which are not generally used by the components’ props or arguments - for instance `key` in React. Specializing further, the generic `JSX.IntrinsicClassAttributes ` type may also be used to specify the same kind of extra attributes just for class components (and not Function Components). In this type, the generic parameter corresponds to the class instance type. In React, this is used to allow the `ref` attribute of type `Ref `. Generally speaking, all of the properties on these interfaces should be optional, unless you intend that users of your JSX framework need to provide some attribute on every tag.

The spread operator also works:



```id
tsxconst props = { requiredProp: "bar" };<foo {...props} />; // okconst badProps = {};<foo {...badProps} />; // error
```



### Children Type Checking

In TypeScript 2.3, TS introduced type checking of children . children is a special property in an element attributes type where child JSXExpression s are taken to be inserted into the attributes.
Similar to how TS uses `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty` to determine the name of props , TS uses `JSX.ElementChildrenAttribute` to determine the name of children within those props.
`JSX.ElementChildrenAttribute` should be declared with a single property.



```id
tsdeclare namespace JSX {  interface ElementChildrenAttribute {    children: {}; // specify children name to use  }}
```




```id
tsx<div>  <h1>Hello</h1></div>;<div>  <h1>Hello</h1>  World</div>;const CustomComp = (props) => <div>{props.children}</div><CustomComp>  <div>Hello World</div>  {"This is just a JS expression..." + 1000}</CustomComp>
```



You can specify the type of children like any other attribute. This will override the default type from, e.g. the React typings if you use them.



```id
tsxinterface PropsType {  children: JSX.Element  name: string}class Component extends React.Component<PropsType, {}> {  render() {    return (      <h2>        {this.props.children}      </h2>    )  }}// OK<Component name="foo">  <h1>Hello World</h1></Component>// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element<Component name="bar">  <h1>Hello World</h1>  <h2>Hello World</h2></Component>// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element or string.<Component name="baz">  <h1>Hello</h1>  World</Component>
```



## The JSX result type

By default the result of a JSX expression is typed as `any`.
You can customize the type by specifying the `JSX.Element` interface.
However, it is not possible to retrieve type information about the element, attributes or children of the JSX from this interface.
It is a black box.

## The JSX function return type

By default, function components must return `JSX.Element | null`. However, this doesn’t always represent runtime behaviour. As of TypeScript 5.1, you can specify `JSX.ElementType` to override what is a valid JSX component type. Note that this doesn’t define what props are valid. The type of props is always defined by the first argument of the component that’s passed. The default looks something like this:



```id
tsnamespace JSX {    export type ElementType =        // All the valid lowercase tags        | keyof IntrinsicElements        // Function components        | (props: any) => Element        // Class components        | new (props: any) => ElementClass;    export interface IntrinsicAttributes extends /*...*/ {}    export type Element = /*...*/;    export type ElementClass = /*...*/;}
```



## Embedding Expressions

JSX allows you to embed expressions between tags by surrounding the expressions with curly braces (`{ }`).



```id
tsxconst a = (  <div>    {["foo", "bar"].map((i) => (      <span>{i / 2}</span>    ))}  </div>);
```



The above code will result in an error since you cannot divide a string by a number.
The output, when using the `preserve` option, looks like:



```id
tsxconst a = (  <div>    {["foo", "bar"].map(function (i) {      return <span>{i / 2}</span>;    })}  </div>);
```



## React integration

To use JSX with React you should use the React typings .
These typings define the `JSX` namespace appropriately for use with React.



```id
tsx/// <reference path="react.d.ts" />interface Props {  foo: string;}class MyComponent extends React.Component<Props, {}> {  render() {    return <span>{this.props.foo}</span>;  }}<MyComponent foo="bar" />; // ok<MyComponent foo={0} />; // error
```



### Configuring JSX

There are multiple compiler flags which can be used to customize your JSX, which work as both a compiler flag and via inline per-file pragmas. To learn more see their tsconfig reference pages:

- `jsxFactory` 

- `jsxFragmentFactory` 

- `jsxImportSource`

# Classes

 
 

Background Reading:
 Classes (MDN) 


 

TypeScript offers full support for the `class` keyword introduced in ES2015.

As with other JavaScript language features, TypeScript adds type annotations and other syntax to allow you to express relationships between classes and other types.

## Class Members

Here’s the most basic class - an empty one:



```id
tsclass Point {}Try
```



This class isn’t very useful yet, so let’s start adding some members.

### Fields

A field declaration creates a public writeable property on a class:



```id
tsclass Point {  x: number;  y: number;} const pt = new Point();pt.x = 0;pt.y = 0;Try
```



As with other locations, the type annotation is optional, but will be an implicit `any` if not specified.

Fields can also have initializers ; these will run automatically when the class is instantiated:



```id
tsclass Point {  x = 0;  y = 0;} const pt = new Point();// Prints 0, 0console.log(`${pt.x}, ${pt.y}`);Try
```



Just like with `const`, `let`, and `var`, the initializer of a class property will be used to infer its type:



```id
tsconst pt = new Point();pt.x = "0";Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.Try
```



#### `--strictPropertyInitialization`

The `strictPropertyInitialization` setting controls whether class fields need to be initialized in the constructor.



```id
tsclass BadGreeter {  name: string;Property 'name' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.2564Property 'name' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.}Try
```




```id
tsclass GoodGreeter {  name: string;   constructor() {    this.name = "hello";  }}Try
```



Note that the field needs to be initialized in the constructor itself .
TypeScript does not analyze methods you invoke from the constructor to detect initializations, because a derived class might override those methods and fail to initialize the members.

If you intend to definitely initialize a field through means other than the constructor (for example, maybe an external library is filling in part of your class for you), you can use the definite assignment assertion operator , `!`:



```id
tsclass OKGreeter {  // Not initialized, but no error  name!: string;}Try
```



### `readonly`

Fields may be prefixed with the `readonly` modifier.
This prevents assignments to the field outside of the constructor.



```id
tsclass Greeter {  readonly name: string = "world";   constructor(otherName?: string) {    if (otherName !== undefined) {      this.name = otherName;    }  }   err() {    this.name = "not ok";Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.  }}const g = new Greeter();g.name = "also not ok";Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.Try
```



### Constructors

 
 

Background Reading:

 Constructor (MDN) 

 


 

Class constructors are very similar to functions.
You can add parameters with type annotations, default values, and overloads:



```id
tsclass Point {  x: number;  y: number;   // Normal signature with defaults  constructor(x = 0, y = 0) {    this.x = x;    this.y = y;  }}Try
```




```id
tsclass Point {  x: number = 0;  y: number = 0;   // Constructor overloads  constructor(x: number, y: number);  constructor(xy: string);  constructor(x: string | number, y: number = 0) {    // Code logic here  }}Try
```



There are just a few differences between class constructor signatures and function signatures:

 Constructors can’t have type parameters - these belong on the outer class declaration, which we’ll learn about later

- Constructors can’t have return type annotations - the class instance type is always what’s returned

#### Super Calls

Just as in JavaScript, if you have a base class, you’ll need to call `super();` in your constructor body before using any `this.` members:



```id
tsclass Base {  k = 4;} class Derived extends Base {  constructor() {    // Prints a wrong value in ES5; throws exception in ES6    console.log(this.k);'super' must be called before accessing 'this' in the constructor of a derived class.17009'super' must be called before accessing 'this' in the constructor of a derived class.    super();  }}Try
```



Forgetting to call `super` is an easy mistake to make in JavaScript, but TypeScript will tell you when it’s necessary.

### Methods

 
 

Background Reading:

 Method definitions 

 


 

A function property on a class is called a method .
Methods can use all the same type annotations as functions and constructors:



```id
tsclass Point {  x = 10;  y = 10;   scale(n: number): void {    this.x *= n;    this.y *= n;  }}Try
```



Other than the standard type annotations, TypeScript doesn’t add anything else new to methods.

Note that inside a method body, it is still mandatory to access fields and other methods via `this.`.
An unqualified name in a method body will always refer to something in the enclosing scope:



```id
tslet x: number = 0; class C {  x: string = "hello";   m() {    // This is trying to modify &apos;x&apos; from line 1, not the class property    x = "world";Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.  }}Try
```



### Getters / Setters

Classes can also have accessors :



```id
tsclass C {  _length = 0;  get length() {    return this._length;  }  set length(value) {    this._length = value;  }}Try
```


 

Note that a field-backed get/set pair with no extra logic is very rarely useful in JavaScript.
It’s fine to expose public fields if you don’t need to add additional logic during the get/set operations.

 

TypeScript has some special inference rules for accessors:

- If `get` exists but no `set`, the property is automatically `readonly`

- If the type of the setter parameter is not specified, it is inferred from the return type of the getter

Since TypeScript 4.3 , it is possible to have accessors with different types for getting and setting.



```id
tsclass Thing {  _size = 0;   get size(): number {    return this._size;  }   set size(value: string | number | boolean) {    let num =  number' >Number(value);     // Don&apos;t allow NaN, Infinity, etc     if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {      this._size = 0;      return;    }     this._size = num;  }}Try
```



### Index Signatures

Classes can declare index signatures; these work the same as Index Signatures for other object types :



```id
tsclass MyClass {  [s: string]: boolean | ((s: string) => boolean);   check(s: string) {    return this[s] as boolean;  }}Try
```



Because the index signature type needs to also capture the types of methods, it’s not easy to usefully use these types.
Generally it’s better to store indexed data in another place instead of on the class instance itself.

## Class Heritage

Like other languages with object-oriented features, classes in JavaScript can inherit from base classes.

### `implements` Clauses

You can use an `implements` clause to check that a class satisfies a particular `interface`.
An error will be issued if a class fails to correctly implement it:



```id
tsinterface Pingable {  ping(): void;} class Sonar implements Pingable {  ping() {    console.log("ping!");  }} class Ball implements Pingable {Class 'Ball' incorrectly implements interface 'Pingable'.
  Property 'ping' is missing in type 'Ball' but required in type 'Pingable'.2420Class 'Ball' incorrectly implements interface 'Pingable'.
  Property 'ping' is missing in type 'Ball' but required in type 'Pingable'.  pong() {    console.log("pong!");  }}Try
```



Classes may also implement multiple interfaces, e.g. `class C implements A, B {`.

#### Cautions

It’s important to understand that an `implements` clause is only a check that the class can be treated as the interface type.
It doesn’t change the type of the class or its methods at all .
A common source of error is to assume that an `implements` clause will change the class type - it doesn’t!



```id
tsinterface Checkable {  check(name: string): boolean;} class NameChecker implements Checkable {  check(s) {Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type.7006Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type.    // Notice no error here    return s.toLowerCase() === "ok";                 any  }}Try
```



In this example, we perhaps expected that `s`’s type would be influenced by the `name: string` parameter of `check`.
It is not - `implements` clauses don’t change how the class body is checked or its type inferred.

Similarly, implementing an interface with an optional property doesn’t create that property:



```id
tsinterface A {  x: number;  y?: number;}class C implements A {  x = 0;}const c = new C();c.y = 10;Property 'y' does not exist on type 'C'.2339Property 'y' does not exist on type 'C'.Try
```



### `extends` Clauses

 
 

Background Reading:

 extends keyword (MDN) 

 


 

Classes may `extend` from a base class.
A derived class has all the properties and methods of its base class, and can also define additional members.



```id
tsclass Animal {  move() {    console.log("Moving along!");  }} class Dog extends Animal {  woof(times: number) {    for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {      console.log("woof!");    }  }} const d = new Dog();// Base class methodd.move();// Derived class methodd.woof(3);Try
```



#### Overriding Methods

 
 

Background Reading:

 super keyword (MDN) 

 


 

A derived class can also override a base class field or property.
You can use the `super.` syntax to access base class methods.
Note that because JavaScript classes are a simple lookup object, there is no notion of a “super field”.

TypeScript enforces that a derived class is always a subtype of its base class.

For example, here’s a legal way to override a method:



```id
tsclass Base {  greet() {    console.log("Hello, world!");  }} class Derived extends Base {  greet(name?: string) {    if (name === undefined) {      super.greet();    } else {      console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);    }  }} const d = new Derived();d.greet();d.greet("reader");Try
```



It’s important that a derived class follow its base class contract.
Remember that it’s very common (and always legal!) to refer to a derived class instance through a base class reference:



```id
ts// Alias the derived instance through a base class referenceconst b: Base = d;// No problemb.greet();Try
```



What if `Derived` didn’t follow `Base`’s contract?



```id
tsclass Base {  greet() {    console.log("Hello, world!");  }} class Derived extends Base {  // Make this parameter required  greet(name: string) {Property 'greet' in type 'Derived' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'Base'.
  Type '(name: string) => void' is not assignable to type '() => void'.
    Target signature provides too few arguments. Expected 1 or more, but got 0.2416Property 'greet' in type 'Derived' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'Base'.
  Type '(name: string) => void' is not assignable to type '() => void'.
    Target signature provides too few arguments. Expected 1 or more, but got 0.    console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);  }}Try
```



If we compiled this code despite the error, this sample would then crash:



```id
tsconst b: Base = new Derived();// Crashes because "name" will be undefinedb.greet();Try
```



#### Type-only Field Declarations

When `target >= ES2022` or `useDefineForClassFields` is `true`, class fields are initialized after the parent class constructor completes, overwriting any value set by the parent class. This can be a problem when you only want to re-declare a more accurate type for an inherited field. To handle these cases, you can write `declare` to indicate to TypeScript that there should be no runtime effect for this field declaration.



```id
tsinterface Animal {  dateOfBirth: any;} interface Dog extends Animal {  breed: any;} class AnimalHouse {  resident: Animal;  constructor(animal: Animal) {    this.resident = animal;  }} class DogHouse extends AnimalHouse {  // Does not emit JavaScript code,  // only ensures the types are correct  declare resident: Dog;  constructor(dog: Dog) {    super(dog);  }}Try
```



#### Initialization Order

The order that JavaScript classes initialize can be surprising in some cases.
Let’s consider this code:



```id
tsclass Base {  name = "base";  constructor() {    console.log("My name is " + this.name);  }} class Derived extends Base {  name = "derived";} // Prints "base", not "derived"const d = new Derived();Try
```



What happened here?

The order of class initialization, as defined by JavaScript, is:

- The base class fields are initialized

- The base class constructor runs

- The derived class fields are initialized

- The derived class constructor runs

This means that the base class constructor saw its own value for `name` during its own constructor, because the derived class field initializations hadn’t run yet.

#### Inheriting Built-in Types

 

Note: If you don’t plan to inherit from built-in types like `Array`, `Error`, `Map`, etc. or your compilation target is explicitly set to `ES6`/`ES2015` or above, you may skip this section

 

In ES2015, constructors which return an object implicitly substitute the value of `this` for any callers of `super(...)`.
It is necessary for generated constructor code to capture any potential return value of `super(...)` and replace it with `this`.

As a result, subclassing `Error`, `Array`, and others may no longer work as expected.
This is due to the fact that constructor functions for `Error`, `Array`, and the like use ECMAScript 6’s `new.target` to adjust the prototype chain;
however, there is no way to ensure a value for `new.target` when invoking a constructor in ECMAScript 5.
Other downlevel compilers generally have the same limitation by default.

For a subclass like the following:



```id
tsclass MsgError extends Error {  constructor(m: string) {    super(m);  }  sayHello() {    return "hello " + this.message;  }}Try
```



you may find that:

- methods may be `undefined` on objects returned by constructing these subclasses, so calling `sayHello` will result in an error.

- `instanceof` will be broken between instances of the subclass and their instances, so `(new MsgError()) instanceof MsgError` will return `false`.

As a recommendation, you can manually adjust the prototype immediately after any `super(...)` calls.



```id
tsclass MsgError extends Error {  constructor(m: string) {    super(m);     // Set the prototype explicitly.    Object.setPrototypeOf(this, MsgError.prototype);  }   sayHello() {    return "hello " + this.message;  }}Try
```



However, any subclass of `MsgError` will have to manually set the prototype as well.
For runtimes that don’t support `Object.setPrototypeOf` , you may instead be able to use `__proto__` .

Unfortunately, these workarounds will not work on Internet Explorer 10 and prior .
One can manually copy methods from the prototype onto the instance itself (i.e. `MsgError.prototype` onto `this`), but the prototype chain itself cannot be fixed.

## Member Visibility

You can use TypeScript to control whether certain methods or properties are visible to code outside the class.

### `public`

The default visibility of class members is `public`.
A `public` member can be accessed anywhere:



```id
tsclass Greeter {  public greet() {    console.log("hi!");  }}const g = new Greeter();g.greet();Try
```



Because `public` is already the default visibility modifier, you don’t ever need to write it on a class member, but might choose to do so for style/readability reasons.

### `protected`

`protected` members are only visible to subclasses of the class they’re declared in.



```id
tsclass Greeter {  public greet() {    console.log("Hello, " + this.getName());  }  protected getName() {    return "hi";  }} class SpecialGreeter extends Greeter {  public howdy() {    // OK to access protected member here    console.log("Howdy, " + this.getName());  }}const g = new SpecialGreeter();g.greet(); // OKg.getName();Property 'getName' is protected and only accessible within class 'Greeter' and its subclasses.2445Property 'getName' is protected and only accessible within class 'Greeter' and its subclasses.Try
```



#### Exposure of `protected` members

Derived classes need to follow their base class contracts, but may choose to expose a subtype of base class with more capabilities.
This includes making `protected` members `public`:



```id
tsclass Base {  protected m = 10;}class Derived extends Base {  // No modifier, so default is &apos;public&apos;  m = 15;}const d = new Derived();console.log(d.m); // OKTry
```



Note that `Derived` was already able to freely read and write `m`, so this doesn’t meaningfully alter the “security” of this situation.
The main thing to note here is that in the derived class, we need to be careful to repeat the `protected` modifier if this exposure isn’t intentional.

#### Cross-hierarchy `protected` access

TypeScript doesn’t allow accessing `protected` members of a sibling class in a class hierarchy:



```id
tsclass Base {  protected x: number = 1;}class Derived1 extends Base {  protected x: number = 5;}class Derived2 extends Base {  f1(other: Derived2) {    other.x = 10;  }  f2(other: Derived1) {    other.x = 10;Property 'x' is protected and only accessible within class 'Derived1' and its subclasses.2445Property 'x' is protected and only accessible within class 'Derived1' and its subclasses.  }}Try
```



This is because accessing `x` in `Derived2` should only be legal from `Derived2`’s subclasses, and `Derived1` isn’t one of them.
Moreover, if accessing `x` through a `Derived1` reference is illegal (which it certainly should be!), then accessing it through a base class reference should never improve the situation.

See also Why Can’t I Access A Protected Member From A Derived Class? which explains more of C#‘s reasoning on the same topic.

### `private`

`private` is like `protected`, but doesn’t allow access to the member even from subclasses:



```id
tsclass Base {  private x = 0;}const b = new Base();// Can&apos;t access from outside the classconsole.log(b.x);Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.2341Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.Try
```




```id
tsclass Derived extends Base {  showX() {    // Can&apos;t access in subclasses    console.log(this.x);Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.2341Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.  }}Try
```



Because `private` members aren’t visible to derived classes, a derived class can’t increase their visibility:



```id
tsclass Base {  private x = 0;}class Derived extends Base {Class 'Derived' incorrectly extends base class 'Base'.
  Property 'x' is private in type 'Base' but not in type 'Derived'.2415Class 'Derived' incorrectly extends base class 'Base'.
  Property 'x' is private in type 'Base' but not in type 'Derived'.  x = 1;}Try
```



#### Cross-instance `private` access

Different OOP languages disagree about whether different instances of the same class may access each others’ `private` members.
While languages like Java, C#, C++, Swift, and PHP allow this, Ruby does not.

TypeScript does allow cross-instance `private` access:



```id
tsclass A {  private x = 10;   public sameAs(other: A) {    // No error    return other.x === this.x;  }}Try
```



#### Caveats

Like other aspects of TypeScript’s type system, `private` and `protected` are only enforced during type checking .

This means that JavaScript runtime constructs like `in` or simple property lookup can still access a `private` or `protected` member:



```id
tsclass MySafe {  private secretKey = 12345;}Try
```




```id
js// In a JavaScript file...const s = new MySafe();// Will print 12345console.log(s.secretKey);
```



`private` also allows access using bracket notation during type checking. This makes `private`-declared fields potentially easier to access for things like unit tests, with the drawback that these fields are soft private and don’t strictly enforce privacy.



```id
tsclass MySafe {  private secretKey = 12345;} const s = new MySafe(); // Not allowed during type checkingconsole.log(s.secretKey);Property 'secretKey' is private and only accessible within class 'MySafe'.2341Property 'secretKey' is private and only accessible within class 'MySafe'. // OKconsole.log(s["secretKey"]);Try
```



Unlike TypeScripts’s `private`, JavaScript’s private fields (`#`) remain private after compilation and do not provide the previously mentioned escape hatches like bracket notation access, making them hard private .



```id
tsclass Dog {  #barkAmount = 0;  personality = "happy";   constructor() {}}Try
```




```id
ts"use strict";class Dog {    #barkAmount = 0;    personality = "happy";    constructor() { }} Try
```



When compiling to ES2021 or less, TypeScript will use WeakMaps in place of `#`.



```id
ts"use strict";var _Dog_barkAmount;class Dog {    constructor() {        _Dog_barkAmount.set(this, 0);        this.personality = "happy";    }}_Dog_barkAmount = new WeakMap(); Try
```



If you need to protect values in your class from malicious actors, you should use mechanisms that offer hard runtime privacy, such as closures, WeakMaps, or private fields. Note that these added privacy checks during runtime could affect performance.

## Static Members

 
 

Background Reading:

 Static Members (MDN) 

 


 

Classes may have `static` members.
These members aren’t associated with a particular instance of the class.
They can be accessed through the class constructor object itself:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  static x = 0;  static printX() {    console.log(MyClass.x);  }}console.log(MyClass.x);MyClass.printX();Try
```



Static members can also use the same `public`, `protected`, and `private` visibility modifiers:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  private static x = 0;}console.log(MyClass.x);Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'MyClass'.2341Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'MyClass'.Try
```



Static members are also inherited:



```id
tsclass Base {  static getGreeting() {    return "Hello world";  }}class Derived extends Base {  myGreeting = Derived.getGreeting();}Try
```



### Special Static Names

It’s generally not safe/possible to overwrite properties from the `Function` prototype.
Because classes are themselves functions that can be invoked with `new`, certain `static` names can’t be used.
Function properties like `name`, `length`, and `call` aren’t valid to define as `static` members:



```id
tsclass S {  static name = "S!";Static property 'name' conflicts with built-in property 'Function.name' of constructor function 'S'.2699Static property 'name' conflicts with built-in property 'Function.name' of constructor function 'S'.}Try
```



### Why No Static Classes?

TypeScript (and JavaScript) don’t have a construct called `static class` the same way as, for example, C# does.

Those constructs only exist because those languages force all data and functions to be inside a class; because that restriction doesn’t exist in TypeScript, there’s no need for them.
A class with only a single instance is typically just represented as a normal object in JavaScript/TypeScript.

For example, we don’t need a “static class” syntax in TypeScript because a regular object (or even top-level function) will do the job just as well:



```id
ts// Unnecessary "static" classclass MyStaticClass {  static doSomething() {}} // Preferred (alternative 1)function doSomething() {} // Preferred (alternative 2)const MyHelperObject = {  dosomething() {},};Try
```



## `static` Blocks in Classes

Static blocks allow you to write a sequence of statements with their own scope that can access private fields within the containing class. This means that we can write initialization code with all the capabilities of writing statements, no leakage of variables, and full access to our class’s internals.



```id
tsclass Foo {    static #count = 0;     get count() {        return Foo.#count;    }     static {        try {            const lastInstances = loadLastInstances();            Foo.#count += lastInstances..length: number' >length;        }        catch {}    }}Try
```



## Generic Classes

Classes, much like interfaces, can be generic.
When a generic class is instantiated with `new`, its type parameters are inferred the same way as in a function call:



```id
tsclass ' >Box<' >Type> {  .contents: Type' >contents: ' >Type;  constructor(value: ' >Type) {    this..contents: Type' >contents = value;  }} const ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>b = new (value: string): Box<string>' >Box("hello!");     const b: Box<string>Try
```



Classes can use generic constraints and defaults the same way as interfaces.

### Type Parameters in Static Members

This code isn’t legal, and it may not be obvious why:



```id
tsclass ' >Box<' >Type> {  static .defaultValue: Type' >defaultValue: Type;Static members cannot reference class type parameters.2302Static members cannot reference class type parameters.}Try
```



Remember that types are always fully erased!
At runtime, there’s only one `Box.defaultValue` property slot.
This means that setting `Box .defaultValue` (if that were possible) would also change `Box .defaultValue` - not good.
The `static` members of a generic class can never refer to the class’s type parameters.

## `this` at Runtime in Classes

 
 

Background Reading:

 this keyword (MDN) 

 


 

It’s important to remember that TypeScript doesn’t change the runtime behavior of JavaScript, and that JavaScript is somewhat famous for having some peculiar runtime behaviors.

JavaScript’s handling of `this` is indeed unusual:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  name = "MyClass";  getName() {    return this.name;  }}const c = new MyClass();const  string;
}' >obj = {  name: "obj",   string' >getName: c.getName,}; // Prints "obj", not "MyClass"console.log( string;
}' >obj. string' >getName());Try
```



Long story short, by default, the value of `this` inside a function depends on how the function was called .
In this example, because the function was called through the `obj` reference, its value of `this` was `obj` rather than the class instance.

This is rarely what you want to happen!
TypeScript provides some ways to mitigate or prevent this kind of error.

### Arrow Functions

 
 

Background Reading:

 Arrow functions (MDN) 

 


 

If you have a function that will often be called in a way that loses its `this` context, it can make sense to use an arrow function property instead of a method definition:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  name = "MyClass";   string' >getName = () => {    return this.name;  };}const c = new MyClass();const  string' >g = c. string' >getName;// Prints "MyClass" instead of crashingconsole.log( string' >g());Try
```



This has some trade-offs:

- The `this` value is guaranteed to be correct at runtime, even for code not checked with TypeScript

- This will use more memory, because each class instance will have its own copy of each function defined this way

- You can’t use `super.getName` in a derived class, because there’s no entry in the prototype chain to fetch the base class method from

### `this` parameters

In a method or function definition, an initial parameter named `this` has special meaning in TypeScript.
These parameters are erased during compilation:



```id
ts// TypeScript input with &apos;this&apos; parameterfunction fn(this: SomeType, x: number) {  /* ... */}Try
```




```id
js// JavaScript outputfunction fn(x) {  /* ... */}
```



TypeScript checks that calling a function with a `this` parameter is done so with a correct context.
Instead of using an arrow function, we can add a `this` parameter to method definitions to statically enforce that the method is called correctly:



```id
tsclass MyClass {  name = "MyClass";  getName(this: MyClass) {    return this.name;  }}const c = new MyClass();// OKc.getName(); // Error, would crashconst  string' >g = c.getName;console.log( string' >g());The 'this' context of type 'void' is not assignable to method's 'this' of type 'MyClass'.2684The 'this' context of type 'void' is not assignable to method's 'this' of type 'MyClass'.Try
```



This method makes the opposite trade-offs of the arrow function approach:

- JavaScript callers might still use the class method incorrectly without realizing it

- Only one function per class definition gets allocated, rather than one per class instance

- Base method definitions can still be called via `super`.

## `this` Types

In classes, a special type called `this` refers dynamically to the type of the current class.
Let’s see how this is useful:

 


```id
tsclass Box {  contents: string = "";  set(value: string) {  (method) Box.set(value: string): this    this.contents = value;    return this;  }}Try
```



Here, TypeScript inferred the return type of `set` to be `this`, rather than `Box`.
Now let’s make a subclass of `Box`:



```id
tsclass ClearableBox extends Box {  clear() {    this.contents = "";  }} const a = new ClearableBox();const b = a.set("hello");     const b: ClearableBoxTry
```



You can also use `this` in a parameter type annotation:



```id
tsclass Box {  content: string = "";  sameAs(other: this) {    return other.content === this.content;  }}Try
```



This is different from writing `other: Box` — if you have a derived class, its `sameAs` method will now only accept other instances of that same derived class:



```id
tsclass Box {  content: string = "";  sameAs(other: this) {    return other.content === this.content;  }} class DerivedBox extends Box {  otherContent: string = "?";} const base = new Box();const derived = new DerivedBox();derived.sameAs(base);Argument of type 'Box' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DerivedBox'.
  Property 'otherContent' is missing in type 'Box' but required in type 'DerivedBox'.2345Argument of type 'Box' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DerivedBox'.
  Property 'otherContent' is missing in type 'Box' but required in type 'DerivedBox'.Try
```



### `this`-based type guards

You can use `this is Type` in the return position for methods in classes and interfaces.
When mixed with a type narrowing (e.g. `if` statements) the type of the target object would be narrowed to the specified `Type`.

 


```id
tsclass FileSystemObject {  isFile(): this is FileRep {    return this instanceof FileRep;  }  isDirectory(): this is Directory {    return this instanceof Directory;  }  isNetworked(): this is Networked & this {    return this.networked;  }  constructor(public path: string, private networked: boolean) {}} class FileRep extends FileSystemObject {  constructor(path: string, public content: string) {    super(path, false);  }} class Directory extends FileSystemObject {  children: FileSystemObject[];} interface Networked {  host: string;} const fso: FileSystemObject = new FileRep("foo/bar.txt", "foo"); if (fso.isFile()) {  fso.content;  const fso: FileRep} else if (fso.isDirectory()) {  fso.children;  const fso: Directory} else if (fso.isNetworked()) {  fso.host;  const fso: Networked & FileSystemObject}Try
```



A common use-case for a this-based type guard is to allow for lazy validation of a particular field. For example, this case removes an `undefined` from the value held inside box when `hasValue` has been verified to be true:



```id
tsclass ' >Box<' >T> {  .value?: T | undefined' >value?: ' >T;   .hasValue(): this is {
    value: T;
}' >hasValue(): this is { value: ' >T } {    return this..value?: T | undefined' >value !== undefined;  }} const ' >box = new (): Box<string>' >Box<string>();' >box..value?: string | undefined' >value = "Gameboy"; ' >box..value?: string' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>value;     (property) Box<string>.value?: string if (' >box..hasValue(): this is {
    value: string;
}' >hasValue()) {   & {
    value: string;
}' >box.value;       (property) value: string}Try
```



## Parameter Properties

TypeScript offers special syntax for turning a constructor parameter into a class property with the same name and value.
These are called parameter properties and are created by prefixing a constructor argument with one of the visibility modifiers `public`, `private`, `protected`, or `readonly`.
The resulting field gets those modifier(s):



```id
tsclass Params {  constructor(    public readonly x: number,    protected y: number,    private z: number  ) {    // No body necessary  }}const a = new Params(1, 2, 3);console.log(a.x);             (property) Params.x: numberconsole.log(a.z);Property 'z' is private and only accessible within class 'Params'.2341Property 'z' is private and only accessible within class 'Params'.Try
```



## Class Expressions

 
 

Background Reading:

 Class expressions (MDN) 

 


 

Class expressions are very similar to class declarations.
The only real difference is that class expressions don’t need a name, though we can refer to them via whatever identifier they ended up bound to:



```id
tsconst someClass = class<' >Type> {  .content: Type' >content: ' >Type;  constructor(value: ' >Type) {    this..content: Type' >content = value;  }}; const ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>m = new (value: string) => someClass<string>' >someClass("Hello, world");     const m: someClass<string>Try
```



## Constructor Signatures

JavaScript classes are instantiated with the `new` operator. Given the type of a class itself, the InstanceType utility type models this operation.



```id
tsclass Point {  createdAt: number;  x: number;  y: number  constructor(x: number, y: number) {    this.createdAt = Date.now()    this.x = x;    this.y = y;  }}type PointInstance =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >InstanceType<typeof Point> function moveRight(point: PointInstance) {  point.x += 5;} const point = new Point(3, 4);moveRight(point);point.x; // => 8Try
```



## `abstract` Classes and Members

Classes, methods, and fields in TypeScript may be abstract .

An abstract method or abstract field is one that hasn’t had an implementation provided.
These members must exist inside an abstract class , which cannot be directly instantiated.

The role of abstract classes is to serve as a base class for subclasses which do implement all the abstract members.
When a class doesn’t have any abstract members, it is said to be concrete .

Let’s look at an example:



```id
tsabstract class Base {  abstract getName(): string;   printName() {    console.log("Hello, " + this.getName());  }} const b = new Base();Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.2511Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.Try
```



We can’t instantiate `Base` with `new` because it’s abstract.
Instead, we need to make a derived class and implement the abstract members:



```id
tsclass Derived extends Base {  getName() {    return "world";  }} const d = new Derived();d.printName();Try
```



Notice that if we forget to implement the base class’s abstract members, we’ll get an error:



```id
tsclass Derived extends Base {Non-abstract class 'Derived' does not implement inherited abstract member getName from class 'Base'.2515Non-abstract class 'Derived' does not implement inherited abstract member getName from class 'Base'.  // forgot to do anything}Try
```



### Abstract Construct Signatures

Sometimes you want to accept some class constructor function that produces an instance of a class which derives from some abstract class.

For example, you might want to write this code:



```id
tsfunction greet(ctor: typeof Base) {  const instance = new  Base' >ctor();Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.2511Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.  instance.printName();}Try
```



TypeScript is correctly telling you that you’re trying to instantiate an abstract class.
After all, given the definition of `greet`, it’s perfectly legal to write this code, which would end up constructing an abstract class:



```id
ts// Bad!greet(Base);Try
```



Instead, you want to write a function that accepts something with a construct signature:



```id
tsfunction  Base): void' >greet( Base' >ctor: new () => Base) {  const instance = new  Base' >ctor();  instance.printName();} Base): void' >greet(Derived); Base): void' >greet(Base);Argument of type 'typeof Base' is not assignable to parameter of type 'new () => Base'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.2345Argument of type 'typeof Base' is not assignable to parameter of type 'new () => Base'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.Try
```



Now TypeScript correctly tells you about which class constructor functions can be invoked - `Derived` can because it’s concrete, but `Base` cannot.

## Relationships Between Classes

In most cases, classes in TypeScript are compared structurally, the same as other types.

For example, these two classes can be used in place of each other because they’re identical:



```id
tsclass Point1 {  x = 0;  y = 0;} class Point2 {  x = 0;  y = 0;} // OKconst p: Point1 = new Point2();Try
```



Similarly, subtype relationships between classes exist even if there’s no explicit inheritance:



```id
tsclass Person {  name: string;  age: number;} class Employee {  name: string;  age: number;  salary: number;} // OKconst p: Person = new Employee();Try
```



This sounds straightforward, but there are a few cases that seem stranger than others.

Empty classes have no members.
In a structural type system, a type with no members is generally a supertype of anything else.
So if you write an empty class (don’t!), anything can be used in place of it:



```id
tsclass Empty {} function fn(x: Empty) {  // can&apos;t do anything with &apos;x&apos;, so I won&apos;t} // All OK!fn(window);fn({});fn(fn);Try
```

TypeScript: Documentation - Mixins

# Mixins

 

Along with traditional OO hierarchies, another popular way of building up classes from reusable components is to build them by combining simpler partial classes.
You may be familiar with the idea of mixins or traits for languages like Scala, and the pattern has also reached some popularity in the JavaScript community.

## How Does A Mixin Work?

The pattern relies on using generics with class inheritance to extend a base class.
TypeScript’s best mixin support is done via the class expression pattern.
You can read more about how this pattern works in JavaScript here .

To get started, we’ll need a class which will have the mixins applied on top of:



```id
tsclass Sprite {  name = "";  x = 0;  y = 0;   constructor(name: string) {    this.name = name;  }}Try
```



Then you need a type and a factory function which returns a class expression extending the base class.



```id
ts// To get started, we need a type which we&apos;ll use to extend// other classes from. The main responsibility is to declare// that the type being passed in is a class. type  {}' >Constructor = new (...args: any[]) => {}; // This mixin adds a scale property, with getters and setters// for changing it with an encapsulated private property: function (Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & TBase' >Scale<(Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & TBase' >TBase extends  {}' >Constructor>(Base: (Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & TBase' >TBase) {  return class Scaling extends Base {    // Mixins may not declare private/protected properties    // however, you can use ES2020 private fields    _scale = 1;     setScale(scale: number) {      this._scale = scale;    }     get scale(): number {      return this._scale;    }  };}Try
```



With these all set up, then you can create a class which represents the base class with mixins applied:



```id
ts// Compose a new class from the Sprite class,// with the Mixin Scale applier:const .Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & typeof Sprite' >EightBitSprite = (Base: typeof Sprite): {
    new (...args: any[]): Scale<typeof Sprite>.Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & typeof Sprite' >Scale(Sprite); const .Scaling & Sprite' >flappySprite = new  Scale<typeof Sprite>.Scaling & Sprite' >EightBitSprite("Bird");.Scaling & Sprite' >flappySprite..setScale(scale: number): void' >setScale(0.8);console.log(.Scaling & Sprite' >flappySprite..scale: number' >scale);Try
```



## Constrained Mixins

In the above form, the mixin’s have no underlying knowledge of the class which can make it hard to create the design you want.

To model this, we modify the original constructor type to accept a generic argument.



```id
ts// This was our previous constructor:type  {}' >Constructor = new (...args: any[]) => {};// Now we use a generic version which can apply a constraint on// the class which this mixin is applied totype  = new (...args: any[]) => T' >GConstructor<' >T = {}> = new (...args: any[]) => ' >T;Try
```



This allows for creating classes which only work with constrained base classes:



```id
tstype  {
    setPos: (x: number, y: number) => void;
}' >Positionable =  = new (...args: any[]) => T' >GConstructor<{  void' >setPos: (x: number, y: number) => void }>;type  Sprite' >Spritable =  = new (...args: any[]) => T' >GConstructor<Sprite>;type  {
    print: () => void;
}' >Loggable =  = new (...args: any[]) => T' >GConstructor<{  void' >print: () => void }>;Try
```



Then you can create mixins which only work when you have a particular base to build on:



```id
tsfunction (Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Jumpable;
    prototype: Jumpable<any>.Jumpable;
} & TBase' >Jumpable<(Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Jumpable;
    prototype: Jumpable<any>.Jumpable;
} & TBase' >TBase extends  {
    setPos: (x: number, y: number) => void;
}' >Positionable>(Base: (Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Jumpable;
    prototype: Jumpable<any>.Jumpable;
} & TBase' >TBase) {  return class Jumpable extends Base {    jump() {      // This mixin will only work if it is passed a base      // class which has setPos defined because of the      // Positionable constraint.      this. void' >setPos(0, 20);    }  };}Try
```



## Alternative Pattern

Previous versions of this document recommended a way to write mixins where you created both the runtime and type hierarchies separately, then merged them at the end:



```id
ts// Each mixin is a traditional ES classclass Jumpable {  jump() {}} class Duckable {  duck() {}} // Including the baseclass Sprite {  x = 0;  y = 0;} // Then you create an interface which merges// the expected mixins with the same name as your baseinterface Sprite extends Jumpable, Duckable {}// Apply the mixins into the base class via// the JS at runtimeapplyMixins(Sprite, [Jumpable, Duckable]); let player = new Sprite();player.jump();console.log(player.x, player.y); // This can live anywhere in your codebase:function applyMixins(derivedCtor: any, constructors: any[]) {  constructors..forEach(callbackfn: (value: any, index: number, array: any[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((baseCtor) => {    Object.getOwnPropertyNames(baseCtor.prototype)..forEach(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((name) => {      Object.(o: any, p: PropertyKey, attributes: PropertyDescriptor & ThisType<any>): any' >defineProperty(        derivedCtor.prototype,        name,        Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(baseCtor.prototype, name) ||          Object.create(null)      );    });  });}Try
```



This pattern relies less on the compiler, and more on your codebase to ensure both runtime and type-system are correctly kept in sync.

## Constraints

The mixin pattern is supported natively inside the TypeScript compiler by code flow analysis.
There are a few cases where you can hit the edges of the native support.

#### Decorators and Mixins `#4881` 

You cannot use decorators to provide mixins via code flow analysis:



```id
ts// A decorator function which replicates the mixin pattern:const  typeof Pausable' >Pausable = (target: typeof Player) => {  return class Pausable extends target {    shouldFreeze = false;  };}; @ typeof Pausable' >Pausableclass Player {  x = 0;  y = 0;} // The Player class does not have the decorator&apos;s type merged:const player = new Player();player.shouldFreeze;Property 'shouldFreeze' does not exist on type 'Player'.2339Property 'shouldFreeze' does not exist on type 'Player'. // The runtime aspect could be manually replicated via// type composition or interface merging.type FreezablePlayer = Player & { shouldFreeze: boolean }; const playerTwo = (new Player() as unknown) as FreezablePlayer;playerTwo.shouldFreeze;Try
```



#### Static Property Mixins `#17829` 

More of a gotcha than a constraint.
The class expression pattern creates singletons, so they can’t be mapped at the type system to support different variable types.

You can work around this by using functions to return your classes which differ based on a generic:



```id
tsfunction (): typeof Base' >base<(): typeof Base' >T>() {  class Base {    static prop: (): typeof Base' >T;  }  return Base;} function (): typeof Derived' >derived<(): typeof Derived' >T>() {  class Derived extends (): typeof Base' >base<(): typeof Derived' >T>() {    static anotherProp: (): typeof Derived' >T;  }  return Derived;} class Spec extends (): typeof Derived' >derived<string>() {} Spec..prop: string' >prop; // stringSpec..anotherProp: string' >anotherProp; // stringTry
```

# Modules

 

JavaScript has a long history of different ways to handle modularizing code.
Having been around since 2012, TypeScript has implemented support for a lot of these formats, but over time the community and the JavaScript specification has converged on a format called ES Modules (or ES6 modules). You might know it as the `import`/`export` syntax.

ES Modules was added to the JavaScript spec in 2015, and by 2020 had broad support in most web browsers and JavaScript runtimes.

For focus, the handbook will cover both ES Modules and its popular pre-cursor CommonJS `module.exports =` syntax, and you can find information about the other module patterns in the reference section under Modules .

## How JavaScript Modules are Defined

In TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing a top-level `import` or `export` is considered a module.

Conversely, a file without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a script whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore to modules as well).

Modules are executed within their own scope, not in the global scope.
This means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported using one of the export forms.
Conversely, to consume a variable, function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, it has to be imported using one of the import forms.

## Non-modules

Before we start, it’s important to understand what TypeScript considers a module.
The JavaScript specification declares that any JavaScript files without an `import` declaration, `export`, or top-level `await` should be considered a script and not a module.

 Inside a script file variables and types are declared to be in the shared global scope, and it’s assumed that you’ll either use the `outFile` compiler option to join multiple input files into one output file, or use multiple `

TypeScript: Documentation - Namespaces

# Namespaces

 

 A note about terminology: 
It’s important to note that in TypeScript 1.5, the nomenclature has changed.
“Internal modules” are now “namespaces”.
“External modules” are now simply “modules”, as to align with ECMAScript 2015 ’s terminology, (namely that `module X {` is equivalent to the now-preferred `namespace X {`).

 

This post outlines the various ways to organize your code using namespaces (previously “internal modules”) in TypeScript.
As we alluded in our note about terminology, “internal modules” are now referred to as “namespaces”.
Additionally, anywhere the `module` keyword was used when declaring an internal module, the `namespace` keyword can and should be used instead.
This avoids confusing new users by overloading them with similarly named terms.

## First steps

Let’s start with the program we’ll be using as our example throughout this page.
We’ve written a small set of simplistic string validators, as you might write to check a user’s input on a form in a webpage or check the format of an externally-provided data file.

## Validators in a single file



```id
tsinterface StringValidator {  isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;}let lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;let numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {  isAcceptable(s: string) {    return lettersRegexp.test(s);  }}class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {  isAcceptable(s: string) {    return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);  }}// Some samples to trylet strings = ["Hello", "98052", "101"];// Validators to uselet validators: { [s: string]: StringValidator } = {};validators["ZIP code"] = new ZipCodeValidator();validators["Letters only"] = new LettersOnlyValidator();// Show whether each string passed each validatorfor (let s of strings) {  for (let name in validators) {    let isMatch = validators[name].isAcceptable(s);    console.log(`'${s}' ${isMatch ? "matches" : "does not match"} '${name}'.`);  }}
```



## Namespacing

As we add more validators, we’re going to want to have some kind of organization scheme so that we can keep track of our types and not worry about name collisions with other objects.
Instead of putting lots of different names into the global namespace, let’s wrap up our objects into a namespace.

In this example, we’ll move all validator-related entities into a namespace called `Validation`.
Because we want the interfaces and classes here to be visible outside the namespace, we preface them with `export`.
Conversely, the variables `lettersRegexp` and `numberRegexp` are implementation details, so they are left unexported and will not be visible to code outside the namespace.
In the test code at the bottom of the file, we now need to qualify the names of the types when used outside the namespace, e.g. `Validation.LettersOnlyValidator`.

## Namespaced Validators



```id
tsnamespace Validation {  export interface StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;  }  const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;  const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;  export class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string) {      return lettersRegexp.test(s);    }  }  export class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string) {      return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);    }  }}// Some samples to trylet strings = ["Hello", "98052", "101"];// Validators to uselet validators: { [s: string]: Validation.StringValidator } = {};validators["ZIP code"] = new Validation.ZipCodeValidator();validators["Letters only"] = new Validation.LettersOnlyValidator();// Show whether each string passed each validatorfor (let s of strings) {  for (let name in validators) {    console.log(      `"${s}" - ${        validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? "matches" : "does not match"      } ${name}`    );  }}
```



## Splitting Across Files

As our application grows, we’ll want to split the code across multiple files to make it easier to maintain.

## Multi-file namespaces

Here, we’ll split our `Validation` namespace across many files.
Even though the files are separate, they can each contribute to the same namespace and can be consumed as if they were all defined in one place.
Because there are dependencies between files, we’ll add reference tags to tell the compiler about the relationships between the files.
Our test code is otherwise unchanged.

 Validation.ts 


```id
tsnamespace Validation {  export interface StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;  }}
```


 LettersOnlyValidator.ts 


```id
ts/// <reference path="Validation.ts" />namespace Validation {  const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;  export class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string) {      return lettersRegexp.test(s);    }  }}
```


 ZipCodeValidator.ts 


```id
ts/// <reference path="Validation.ts" />namespace Validation {  const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;  export class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string) {      return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);    }  }}
```


 Test.ts 


```id
ts/// <reference path="Validation.ts" />/// <reference path="LettersOnlyValidator.ts" />/// <reference path="ZipCodeValidator.ts" />// Some samples to trylet strings = ["Hello", "98052", "101"];// Validators to uselet validators: { [s: string]: Validation.StringValidator } = {};validators["ZIP code"] = new Validation.ZipCodeValidator();validators["Letters only"] = new Validation.LettersOnlyValidator();// Show whether each string passed each validatorfor (let s of strings) {  for (let name in validators) {    console.log(      `"${s}" - ${        validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? "matches" : "does not match"      } ${name}`    );  }}
```



Once there are multiple files involved, we’ll need to make sure all of the compiled code gets loaded.
There are two ways of doing this.

First, we can use concatenated output using the `outFile` option to compile all of the input files into a single JavaScript output file:



```
tsc --outFile sample.js Test.ts
```

 

The compiler will automatically order the output file based on the reference tags present in the files. You can also specify each file individually:



```
tsc --outFile sample.js Validation.ts LettersOnlyValidator.ts ZipCodeValidator.ts Test.ts
```

 
 Alternatively, we can use per-file compilation (the default) to emit one JavaScript file for each input file.
If multiple JS files get produced, we’ll need to use `

# Utility Types

 

TypeScript provides several utility types to facilitate common type transformations. These utilities are available globally.

## `Awaited `

 

Released:
 4.5 

 

This type is meant to model operations like `await` in `async` functions, or the
`.then()` method on `Promise`s - specifically, the way that they recursively
unwrap `Promise`s.

 Example 


```id
tstype A =  = T extends null | undefined ? T : T extends object & {
    then(onfulfilled: infer F, ...args: infer _): any;
} ? F extends (value: infer V, ...args: infer _) => any ? Awaited<V> : never : T' >Awaited<' >Promise<string>>;    type A = string type B =  = T extends null | undefined ? T : T extends object & {
    then(onfulfilled: infer F, ...args: infer _): any;
} ? F extends (value: infer V, ...args: infer _) => any ? Awaited<V> : never : T' >Awaited<' >Promise<' >Promise<number>>>;    type B = number type C =  = T extends null | undefined ? T : T extends object & {
    then(onfulfilled: infer F, ...args: infer _): any;
} ? F extends (value: infer V, ...args: infer _) => any ? Awaited<V> : never : T' >Awaited<boolean | ' >Promise<number>>;    type C = number | booleanTry
```



## `Partial `

 

Released:

 2.1 

 

Constructs a type with all properties of `Type` set to optional. This utility will return a type that represents all subsets of a given type.

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Todo {  title: string;  description: string;} function ): {
    title: string;
    description: string;
}' >updateTodo(todo: Todo, ' >fieldsToUpdate:  = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P] | undefined; }' >Partial<Todo>) {  return { ...todo, ...' >fieldsToUpdate };} const todo1 = {  title: "organize desk",  description: "clear clutter",}; const todo2 = ): {
    title: string;
    description: string;
}' >updateTodo(todo1, {  description: "throw out trash",});Try
```



## `Required `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type consisting of all properties of `Type` set to required. The opposite of `Partial` .

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Props {  a?: number;  b?: string;} const obj: Props = { a: 5 }; const ' >obj2:  = { [P in keyof T]-?: T[P]; }' >Required<Props> = { a: 5 };Property 'b' is missing in type '{ a: number; }' but required in type 'Required<Props>'.2741Property 'b' is missing in type '{ a: number; }' but required in type 'Required<Props>'.Try
```



## `Readonly `

 

Released:

 2.1 

 

Constructs a type with all properties of `Type` set to `readonly`, meaning the properties of the constructed type cannot be reassigned.

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Todo {  title: string;} const ' >todo:  = { readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P]; }' >Readonly<Todo> = {  title: "Delete inactive users",}; ' >todo.title = "Hello";Cannot assign to 'title' because it is a read-only property.2540Cannot assign to 'title' because it is a read-only property.Try
```



This utility is useful for representing assignment expressions that will fail at runtime (i.e. when attempting to reassign properties of a frozen object ).

 `Object.freeze` 


```id
tsfunction freeze<Type>(obj: Type): Readonly<Type>;
```



## `Record `

 

Released:

 2.1 

 

Constructs an object type whose property keys are `Keys` and whose property values are `Type`. This utility can be used to map the properties of a type to another type.

 Example 


```id
tstype CatName = "miffy" | "boris" | "mordred"; interface CatInfo {  age: number;  breed: string;} const ' >cats:  = { [P in K]: T; }' >Record<CatName, CatInfo> = {  miffy: { age: 10, breed: "Persian" },  boris: { age: 5, breed: "Maine Coon" },  mordred: { age: 16, breed: "British Shorthair" },}; ' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>cats.boris; const cats: Record<CatName, CatInfo>Try
```



## `Pick `

 

Released:

 2.1 

 

Constructs a type by picking the set of properties `Keys` (string literal or union of string literals) from `Type`.

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Todo {  title: string;  description: string;  completed: boolean;} type TodoPreview =  = { [P in K]: T[P]; }' >Pick<Todo, "title" | "completed">; const todo: TodoPreview = {  title: "Clean room",  completed: false,}; todo; const todo: TodoPreviewTry
```



## `Omit `

 

Released:

 3.5 

 

Constructs a type by picking all properties from `Type` and then removing `Keys` (string literal or union of string literals). The opposite of `Pick` .

 Example 


```id
tsinterface Todo {  title: string;  description: string;  completed: boolean;  createdAt: number;} type TodoPreview =  = { [P in Exclude<keyof T, K>]: T[P]; }' >Omit<Todo, "description">; const todo: TodoPreview = {  title: "Clean room",  completed: false,  createdAt: 1615544252770,}; todo; const todo: TodoPreview type TodoInfo =  = { [P in Exclude<keyof T, K>]: T[P]; }' >Omit<Todo, "completed" | "createdAt">; const todoInfo: TodoInfo = {  title: "Pick up kids",  description: "Kindergarten closes at 5pm",}; todoInfo;   const todoInfo: TodoInfoTry
```



## `Exclude `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type by excluding from `UnionType` all union members that are assignable to `ExcludedMembers`.

 Example 


```id
tstype T0 =  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<"a" | "b" | "c", "a">;     type T0 = "b" | "c"type T1 =  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<"a" | "b" | "c", "a" | "b">;     type T1 = "c"type T2 =  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<string | number | (() => void), Function>;     type T2 = string | number type Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; x: number }  | { kind: "triangle"; x: number; y: number }; type T3 =  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<Shape, { kind: "circle" }>     type T3 = {
    kind: "square";
    x: number;
} | {
    kind: "triangle";
    x: number;
    y: number;
}Try
```



## `Extract `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type by extracting from `Type` all union members that are assignable to `Union`.

 Example 


```id
tstype T0 =  = T extends U ? T : never' >Extract<"a" | "b" | "c", "a" | "f">;     type T0 = "a"type  void' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>T1 =  = T extends U ? T : never' >Extract<string | number | (() => void), Function>;     type T1 = () => void type Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; x: number }  | { kind: "triangle"; x: number; y: number }; type T2 =  = T extends U ? T : never' >Extract<Shape, { kind: "circle" }>     type T2 = {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}Try
```



## `NonNullable `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type by excluding `null` and `undefined` from `Type`.

 Example 


```id
tstype T0 =  = T & {}' >NonNullable<string | number | undefined>;     type T0 = string | numbertype T1 =  = T & {}' >NonNullable<string[] | null | undefined>;     type T1 = string[]Try
```



## `Parameters `

 

Released:

 3.1 

 

Constructs a tuple type from the types used in the parameters of a function type `Type`.

For overloaded functions, this will be the parameters of the last signature; see Inferring Within Conditional Types .

 Example 


```id
tsdeclare function f1(arg: { a: number; b: string }): void; type T0 =  any> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >Parameters<() => string>;     type T0 = []type T1 =  any> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ?

P : never' >Parameters<typeof f1>;     type T3 = [arg: {
    a: number;
    b: string;
}]type T4 =  any> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >Parameters<any>;     type T4 = unknown[]type T5 =  any> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >Parameters<never>;     type T5 = nevertype T6 =  any> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >Parameters<string>;Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.2344Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.     type T6 = nevertype T7 =  any> = T extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >Parameters<Function>;Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature '(...args: any): any'.2344Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature '(...args: any): any'.     type T7 = neverTry
```



## `ConstructorParameters `

 

Released:

 3.1 

 

Constructs a tuple or array type from the types of a constructor function type. It produces a tuple type with all the parameter types (or the type `never` if `Type` is not a function).

 Example 


```id
tstype T0 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >ConstructorParameters<ErrorConstructor>;     type T0 = [message?: string]type T1 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >ConstructorParameters<FunctionConstructor>;     type T1 = string[]type T2 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >ConstructorParameters<RegExpConstructor>;     type T2 = [pattern: string | RegExp, flags?: string]class C {  constructor(a: number, b: string) {}}type T3 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >ConstructorParameters<typeof C>;     type T3 = [a: number, b: string]type T4 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >ConstructorParameters<any>;     type T4 = unknown[] type T5 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never' >ConstructorParameters<Function>;Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature 'new (...args: any): any'.2344Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature 'new (...args: any): any'.     type T5 = neverTry
```



## `ReturnType `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type consisting of the return type of function `Type`.

For overloaded functions, this will be the return type of the last signature; see Inferring Within Conditional Types .

 Example 


```id
tsdeclare function f1(): { a: number; b: string }; type T0 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<() => string>;     type T0 = stringtype T1 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<(s: string) => void>;     type T1 = voidtype T2 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<<(): T' >T>() => (): T' >T>;     type T2 = unknowntype T3 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<<(): T' >T extends (): T' >U, (): T' >U extends number[]>() => (): T' >T>;     type T3 = number[]type T4 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<typeof f1>;     type T4 = {
    a: number;
    b: string;
}type T5 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<any>;     type T5 = anytype T6 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<never>;     type T6 = nevertype T7 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<string>;Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.2344Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.     type T7 = anytype T8 =  any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >ReturnType<Function>;Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature '(...args: any): any'.2344Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature '(...args: any): any'.     type T8 = anyTry
```



## `InstanceType `

 

Released:

 2.8 

 

Constructs a type consisting of the instance type of a constructor function in `Type`.

 Example 


```id
tsclass C {  x = 0;  y = 0;} type T0 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >InstanceType<typeof C>;     type T0 = Ctype T1 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >InstanceType<any>;     type T1 = anytype T2 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ?

R : any' >InstanceType<string>;Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.2344Type 'string' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.     type T3 = anytype T4 =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >InstanceType<Function>;Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature 'new (...args: any): any'.2344Type 'Function' does not satisfy the constraint 'abstract new (...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'Function' provides no match for the signature 'new (...args: any): any'.     type T4 = anyTry
```



## `NoInfer `

 

Released:

 5.4 

 

Blocks inferences to the contained type. Other than blocking inferences, `NoInfer ` is
identical to `Type`.

 Example 


```id
tsfunction createStreetLight<C extends string>(  colors: C[],  defaultColor?: NoInfer<C>,) {  // ...}createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "red");  // OKcreateStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "blue");  // Error
```



## `ThisParameterType `

 

Released:

 3.3 

 

Extracts the type of the this parameter for a function type, or unknown if the function type has no `this` parameter.

 Example 


```id
tsfunction toHex(this: Number) {  return this.toString(16);} function ): string' >numberToString(n:  = T extends (this: infer U, ...args: never) => any ? U : unknown' >ThisParameterType<typeof toHex>) {  return toHex.(this: (this: Number) => string, thisArg: Number): string (+1 overload)' >apply(n);}Try
```



## `OmitThisParameter `

 

Released:

 3.3 

 

Removes the `this` parameter from `Type`. If `Type` has no explicitly declared `this` parameter, the result is simply `Type`. Otherwise, a new function type with no `this` parameter is created from `Type`. Generics are erased and only the last overload signature is propagated into the new function type.

 Example 


```id
tsfunction toHex(this: Number) {  return this.toString(16);} const  string' >fiveToHex:  = unknown extends ThisParameterType<T> ? T : T extends (...args: infer A) => infer R ? (...args: A) => R : T' >OmitThisParameter<typeof toHex> = toHex. string>(this: (this: Number) => string, thisArg: Number): () => string (+1 overload)' >bind(5); console.log( string' >fiveToHex());Try
```



## `ThisType `

 

Released:

 2.3 

 

This utility does not return a transformed type. Instead, it serves as a marker for a contextual `this` type. Note that the `noImplicitThis` flag must be enabled to use this utility.

 Example 


```id
tstype  = {
    data?: D;
    methods?: M & ThisType<D & M>;
}' >ObjectDescriptor<' >D, ' >M> = {  data?: ' >D;  ) | undefined' >methods?: ' >M & ' >ThisType<' >D & ' >M>; // Type of &apos;this&apos; in methods is D & M}; function (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >makeObject<(desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >D, (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >M>(' >desc:  = {
    data?: D;
    methods?: M & ThisType<D & M>;
}' >ObjectDescriptor<(desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >D, (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >M>): (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >D & (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >M {  let data: object = ' >desc.data || {};  let methods: object = ' >desc.) | undefined' >methods || {};  return { ...data, ...methods } as (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >D & (desc: ObjectDescriptor<D, M>): D & M' >M;} let obj = (desc: ObjectDescriptor<{
    x: number;
    y: number;
}, {
    moveBy(dx: number, dy: number): void;
}>): {
    x: number;
    y: number;
} & {
    moveBy(dx: number, dy: number): void;
}' >makeObject({  data: { x: 0, y: 0 },  ) | undefined' >methods: {    moveBy(dx: number, dy: number) {      this.x += dx; // Strongly typed this      this.y += dy; // Strongly typed this    },  },}); obj.x = 10;obj.y = 20;obj.moveBy(5, 5);Try
```



In the example above, the `methods` object in the argument to `makeObject` has a contextual type that includes `ThisType ` and therefore the type of this in methods within the `methods` object is 

```
{ x: number, y: number } & { moveBy(dx: number, dy: number): void }
```

. Notice how the type of the `methods` property simultaneously is an inference target and a source for the `this` type in methods.

The `ThisType ` marker interface is simply an empty interface declared in `lib.d.ts`. Beyond being recognized in the contextual type of an object literal, the interface acts like any empty interface.

## Intrinsic String Manipulation Types

### `Uppercase `

### `Lowercase `

### `Capitalize `

### `Uncapitalize `

To help with string manipulation around template string literals, TypeScript includes a set of types which can be used in string manipulation within the type system. You can find those in the Template Literal Types documentation.

# Namespaces and Modules

 

This post outlines the various ways to organize your code using modules and namespaces in TypeScript.
We’ll also go over some advanced topics of how to use namespaces and modules, and address some common pitfalls when using them in TypeScript.

See the Modules documentation for more information about ES Modules.
See the Namespaces documentation for more information about TypeScript namespaces.

Note: In very old versions of TypeScript namespaces were called ‘Internal Modules’, these pre-date JavaScript module systems.

## Using Modules

Modules can contain both code and declarations.

Modules also have a dependency on a module loader (such as CommonJs/Require.js) or a runtime which supports ES Modules.
Modules provide for better code reuse, stronger isolation and better tooling support for bundling.

It is also worth noting that, for Node.js applications, modules are the default and we recommended modules over namespaces in modern code .

Starting with ECMAScript 2015, modules are native part of the language, and should be supported by all compliant engine implementations.
Thus, for new projects modules would be the recommended code organization mechanism.

## Using Namespaces

 Namespaces are a TypeScript-specific way to organize code.

Namespaces are simply named JavaScript objects in the global namespace.
This makes namespaces a very simple construct to use.
Unlike modules, they can span multiple files, and can be concatenated using `outFile` .
Namespaces can be a good way to structure your code in a Web Application, with all dependencies included as `

### TypeScript: Documentation - Decorators

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html#handbook-content

- TypeScript: Documentation - Decorators 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Decorators

 

NOTE  This document refers to an experimental stage 2 decorators implementation. Stage 3 decorator support is available since Typescript 5.0.
See: Decorators in Typescript 5.0 

 

## Introduction

With the introduction of Classes in TypeScript and ES6, there now exist certain scenarios that require additional features to support annotating or modifying classes and class members.
Decorators provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.

 

Further Reading (stage 2): A Complete Guide to TypeScript Decorators 

 

To enable experimental support for decorators, you must enable the `experimentalDecorators` compiler option either on the command line or in your `tsconfig.json`:

 Command Line :



```id
shelltsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators
```



 tsconfig.json :



```
{  "compilerOptions": {    "target": "ES5",    "experimentalDecorators": true  }}
```



## Decorators

A Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration , method , accessor , property , or parameter .
Decorators use the form `@expression`, where `expression` must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.

For example, given the decorator `@sealed` we might write the `sealed` function as follows:



```id
tsfunction sealed(target) {  // do something with 'target' ...}
```



## Decorator Factories

If we want to customize how a decorator is applied to a declaration, we can write a decorator factory.
A Decorator Factory is simply a function that returns the expression that will be called by the decorator at runtime.

We can write a decorator factory in the following fashion:



```id
tsfunction color(value: string) {  // this is the decorator factory, it sets up  // the returned decorator function  return function (target) {    // this is the decorator    // do something with 'target' and 'value'...  };}
```



## Decorator Composition

Multiple decorators can be applied to a declaration, for example on a single line:



```id
ts@f @g xTry
```



On multiple lines:



```id
ts@f@gxTry
```



When multiple decorators apply to a single declaration, their evaluation is similar to function composition in mathematics . In this model, when composing functions f and g , the resulting composite ( f ∘ g )( x ) is equivalent to f ( g ( x )).

As such, the following steps are performed when evaluating multiple decorators on a single declaration in TypeScript:

 The expressions for each decorator are evaluated top-to-bottom.

- The results are then called as functions from bottom-to-top.

If we were to use decorator factories , we can observe this evaluation order with the following example:

 


```id
tsfunction  void' >first() {  console.log("first(): factory evaluated");  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {    console.log("first(): called");  };} function  void' >second() {  console.log("second(): factory evaluated");  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {    console.log("second(): called");  };} class ExampleClass {  @ void' >first()  @ void' >second()  method() {}}Try
```



Which would print this output to the console:



```id
shellfirst(): factory evaluatedsecond(): factory evaluatedsecond(): calledfirst(): called
```



## Decorator Evaluation

There is a well defined order to how decorators applied to various declarations inside of a class are applied:

- Parameter Decorators , followed by Method , Accessor , or Property Decorators are applied for each instance member.

- Parameter Decorators , followed by Method , Accessor , or Property Decorators are applied for each static member.

- Parameter Decorators are applied for the constructor.

- Class Decorators are applied for the class.

## Class Decorators

A Class Decorator is declared just before a class declaration.
The class decorator is applied to the constructor of the class and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a class definition.
A class decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as on a `declare` class).

The expression for the class decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the constructor of the decorated class as its only argument.

If the class decorator returns a value, it will replace the class declaration with the provided constructor function.

 

NOTE  Should you choose to return a new constructor function, you must take care to maintain the original prototype.
The logic that applies decorators at runtime will not do this for you.

 

The following is an example of a class decorator (`@sealed`) applied to a `BugReport` class:



```id
ts@sealedclass BugReport {  type = "report";  title: string;   constructor(t: string) {    this.title = t;  }}Try
```



We can define the `@sealed` decorator using the following function declaration:



```id
tsfunction sealed(constructor: Function) {  Object.seal(constructor);  Object.seal(constructor.prototype);}
```



When `@sealed` is executed, it will seal both the constructor and its prototype, and will therefore prevent any further functionality from being added to or removed from this class during runtime by accessing `BugReport.prototype` or by defining properties on `BugReport` itself (note that ES2015 classes are really just syntactic sugar to prototype-based constructor functions). This decorator does not prevent classes from sub-classing `BugReport`.

Next we have an example of how to override the constructor to set new defaults.

 


```id
tsfunction (constructor: T): {
    new (...args: any[]): (Anonymous class);
    prototype: reportableClassDecorator<any>.(Anonymous class);
} & T' >reportableClassDecorator<(constructor: T): {
    new (...args: any[]): (Anonymous class);
    prototype: reportableClassDecorator<any>.(Anonymous class);
} & T' >T extends { new (...args: any[]): {} }>(constructor: (constructor: T): {
    new (...args: any[]): (Anonymous class);
    prototype: reportableClassDecorator<any>.(Anonymous class);
} & T' >T) {  return class extends constructor {    reportingURL = "http://www...";  };} @(constructor: T): {
    new (...args: any[]): (Anonymous class);
    prototype: reportableClassDecorator<any>.(Anonymous class);
} & T' >reportableClassDecoratorclass BugReport {  type = "report";  title: string;   constructor(t: string) {    this.title = t;  }} const bug = new BugReport("Needs dark mode");console.log(bug.title); // Prints "Needs dark mode"console.log(bug.type); // Prints "report" // Note that the decorator _does not_ change the TypeScript type// and so the new property `reportingURL` is not known// to the type system:bug.reportingURL;Property 'reportingURL' does not exist on type 'BugReport'.2339Property 'reportingURL' does not exist on type 'BugReport'.Try
```



## Method Decorators

A Method Decorator is declared just before a method declaration.
The decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the method, and can be used to observe, modify, or replace a method definition.
A method decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, on an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the method decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:

- Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.

- The name of the member.

- The Property Descriptor for the member.

 

NOTE  The Property Descriptor will be `undefined` if your script target is less than `ES5`.

 

If the method decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the method.

 

NOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than `ES5`.

 

The following is an example of a method decorator (`@enumerable`) applied to a method on the `Greeter` class:

 


```id
tsclass Greeter {  greeting: string;  constructor(message: string) {    this.greeting = message;  }   @ void' >enumerable(false)  greet() {    return "Hello, " + this.greeting;  }}Try
```



We can define the `@enumerable` decorator using the following function declaration:

 


```id
tsfunction  void' >enumerable(value: boolean) {  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {    descriptor.enumerable = value;  };}Try
```



The `@enumerable(false)` decorator here is a decorator factory .
When the `@enumerable(false)` decorator is called, it modifies the `enumerable` property of the property descriptor.

## Accessor Decorators

An Accessor Decorator is declared just before an accessor declaration.
The accessor decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the accessor and can be used to observe, modify, or replace an accessor’s definitions.
An accessor decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

 

NOTE  TypeScript disallows decorating both the `get` and `set` accessor for a single member.
Instead, all decorators for the member must be applied to the first accessor specified in document order.
This is because decorators apply to a Property Descriptor , which combines both the `get` and `set` accessor, not each declaration separately.

 

The expression for the accessor decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:

- Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.

- The name of the member.

- The Property Descriptor for the member.

 

NOTE  The Property Descriptor will be `undefined` if your script target is less than `ES5`.

 

If the accessor decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the member.

 

NOTE  The return value is ignored if your script target is less than `ES5`.

 

The following is an example of an accessor decorator (`@configurable`) applied to a member of the `Point` class:



```id
tsclass Point {  private _x: number;  private _y: number;  constructor(x: number, y: number) {    this._x = x;    this._y = y;  }   @ void' >configurable(false)  get x() {    return this._x;  }   @ void' >configurable(false)  get y() {    return this._y;  }}Try
```



We can define the `@configurable` decorator using the following function declaration:

 


```id
tsfunction configurable(value: boolean) {  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {    descriptor.configurable = value;  };}
```



## Property Decorators

A Property Decorator is declared just before a property declaration.
A property decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the property decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following two arguments:

- Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.

- The name of the member.

 

NOTE  A Property Descriptor is not provided as an argument to a property decorator due to how property decorators are initialized in TypeScript.
This is because there is currently no mechanism to describe an instance property when defining members of a prototype, and no way to observe or modify the initializer for a property. The return value is ignored too.
As such, a property decorator can only be used to observe that a property of a specific name has been declared for a class.

 

We can use this information to record metadata about the property, as in the following example:



```id
tsclass Greeter {  @format("Hello, %s")  greeting: string;  constructor(message: string) {    this.greeting = message;  }  greet() {    let formatString = getFormat(this, "greeting");    return formatString.replace("%s", this.greeting);  }}
```



We can then define the `@format` decorator and `getFormat` functions using the following function declarations:



```id
tsimport "reflect-metadata";const formatMetadataKey = Symbol("format");function format(formatString: string) {  return Reflect.metadata(formatMetadataKey, formatString);}function getFormat(target: any, propertyKey: string) {  return Reflect.getMetadata(formatMetadataKey, target, propertyKey);}
```



The `@format("Hello, %s")` decorator here is a decorator factory .
When `@format("Hello, %s")` is called, it adds a metadata entry for the property using the `Reflect.metadata` function from the `reflect-metadata` library.
When `getFormat` is called, it reads the metadata value for the format.

 

NOTE  This example requires the `reflect-metadata` library.
See Metadata for more information about the `reflect-metadata` library.

 

## Parameter Decorators

A Parameter Decorator is declared just before a parameter declaration.
The parameter decorator is applied to the function for a class constructor or method declaration.
A parameter decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, an overload, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the parameter decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:

- Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member.

- The name of the member.

- The ordinal index of the parameter in the function’s parameter list.

 

NOTE  A parameter decorator can only be used to observe that a parameter has been declared on a method.

 

The return value of the parameter decorator is ignored.

The following is an example of a parameter decorator (`@required`) applied to parameter of a member of the `BugReport` class:

 


```id
tsclass BugReport {  type = "report";  title: string;   constructor(t: string) {    this.title = t;  }   @): void' >validate  print(@required verbose: boolean) {    if (verbose) {      return `type: ${this.type}\ntitle: ${this.title}`;    } else {     return this.title;     }  }}Try
```



We can then define the `@required` and `@validate` decorators using the following function declarations:

 


```id
tsimport "reflect-metadata";const requiredMetadataKey =  symbol' >Symbol("required"); function required(target: Object, propertyKey: string | symbol, parameterIndex: number) {  let existingRequiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyKey) || [];  existingRequiredParameters..push(...items: number[]): number' >push(parameterIndex);  Reflect.defineMetadata( requiredMetadataKey, existingRequiredParameters, target, propertyKey);} function ): void' >validate(target: any, propertyName: string, ' >descriptor: ' >TypedPropertyDescriptor<Function>) {  let method = ' >descriptor..value?: Function | undefined' >value!;   ' >descriptor..value?: Function | undefined' >value = function () {    let requiredParameters: number[] = Reflect.getOwnMetadata(requiredMetadataKey, target, propertyName);    if (requiredParameters) {      for (let parameterIndex of requiredParameters) {        if (parameterIndex >= arguments.length || arguments[parameterIndex] === undefined) {          throw new  Error' >Error("Missing required argument.");        }      }    }    return method.apply(this, arguments);  };}Try
```



The `@required` decorator adds a metadata entry that marks the parameter as required.
The `@validate` decorator then wraps the existing `print` method in a function that validates the arguments before invoking the original method.

 

NOTE  This example requires the `reflect-metadata` library.
See Metadata for more information about the `reflect-metadata` library.

 

## Metadata

Some examples use the `reflect-metadata` library which adds a polyfill for an experimental metadata API .
This library is not yet part of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard.
However, once decorators are officially adopted as part of the ECMAScript standard these extensions will be proposed for adoption.

You can install this library via npm:



```id
shellnpm i reflect-metadata --save
```



TypeScript includes experimental support for emitting certain types of metadata for declarations that have decorators.
To enable this experimental support, you must set the `emitDecoratorMetadata` compiler option either on the command line or in your `tsconfig.json`:

 Command Line :



```id
shelltsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators --emitDecoratorMetadata
```



 tsconfig.json :



```
{  "compilerOptions": {    "target": "ES5",    "experimentalDecorators": true,    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true  }}
```



When enabled, as long as the `reflect-metadata` library has been imported, additional design-time type information will be exposed at runtime.

We can see this in action in the following example:

 


```id
tsimport "reflect-metadata"; class Point {  constructor(public x: number, public y: number) {}} class Line {  private _start: Point;  private _end: Point;   @(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >validate  set start(value: Point) {    this._start = value;  }   get start() {    return this._start;  }   @(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >validate  set end(value: Point) {    this._end = value;  }   get end() {    return this._end;  }} function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >validate<(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >T>(target: any, propertyKey: string, ' >descriptor: ' >TypedPropertyDescriptor<(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >T>) {  let  void' >set = ' >descriptor..set?: ((value: T) => void) | undefined' >set!;    ' >descriptor..set?: ((value: T) => void) | undefined' >set = function (value: (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>): void' >T) {    let type = Reflect.getMetadata("design:type", target, propertyKey);     if (!(value instanceof type)) {      throw new  TypeError (+1 overload)' >TypeError(`Invalid type, got ${typeof value} not ${type.name}.`);    }      void' >set., [T], void>(this: (this: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>, args_0: T) => void, thisArg: TypedPropertyDescriptor<T>, args_0: T): void' >call(this, value);  };} const line = new Line()line.start = new Point(0, 0) // @ts-ignore// line.end = {} // Fails at runtime with:// > Invalid type, got object not Point Try
```



The TypeScript compiler will inject design-time type information using the `@Reflect.metadata` decorator.
You could consider it the equivalent of the following TypeScript:



```id
tsclass Line {  private _start: Point;  private _end: Point;  @validate  @Reflect.metadata("design:type", Point)  set start(value: Point) {    this._start = value;  }  get start() {    return this._start;  }  @validate  @Reflect.metadata("design:type", Point)  set end(value: Point) {    this._end = value;  }  get end() {    return this._end;  }}
```


 

NOTE  Decorator metadata is an experimental feature and may introduce breaking changes in future releases.

# Declaration Merging

 

## Introduction

Some of the unique concepts in TypeScript describe the shape of JavaScript objects at the type level.
One example that is especially unique to TypeScript is the concept of ‘declaration merging’.
Understanding this concept will give you an advantage when working with existing JavaScript.
It also opens the door to more advanced abstraction concepts.

For the purposes of this article, “declaration merging” means that the compiler merges two separate declarations declared with the same name into a single definition.
This merged definition has the features of both of the original declarations.
Any number of declarations can be merged; it’s not limited to just two declarations.

## Basic Concepts

In TypeScript, a declaration creates entities in at least one of three groups: namespace, type, or value.
Namespace-creating declarations create a namespace, which contains names that are accessed using a dotted notation.
Type-creating declarations do just that: they create a type that is visible with the declared shape and bound to the given name.
Lastly, value-creating declarations create values that are visible in the output JavaScript.

 
 
 
 Declaration Type 
 Namespace 
 Type 
 Value 
 
 
 
 
 Namespace 
 X 
 
 X 
 
 
 Class 
 
 X 
 X 
 
 
 Enum 
 
 X 
 X 
 
 
 Interface 
 
 X 
 
 
 
 Type Alias 
 
 X 
 
 
 
 Function 
 
 
 X 
 
 
 Variable 
 
 
 X 
 
 
 

Understanding what is created with each declaration will help you understand what is merged when you perform a declaration merge.

## Merging Interfaces

The simplest, and perhaps most common, type of declaration merging is interface merging.
At the most basic level, the merge mechanically joins the members of both declarations into a single interface with the same name.



```id
tsinterface Box {  height: number;  width: number;}interface Box {  scale: number;}let box: Box = { height: 5, width: 6, scale: 10 };
```



Non-function members of the interfaces should be unique.
If they are not unique, they must be of the same type.
The compiler will issue an error if the interfaces both declare a non-function member of the same name, but of different types.

For function members, each function member of the same name is treated as describing an overload of the same function.
Of note, too, is that in the case of interface `A` merging with later interface `A`, the second interface will have a higher precedence than the first.

That is, in the example:



```id
tsinterface Cloner {  clone(animal: Animal): Animal;}interface Cloner {  clone(animal: Sheep): Sheep;}interface Cloner {  clone(animal: Dog): Dog;  clone(animal: Cat): Cat;}
```



The three interfaces will merge to create a single declaration as so:



```id
tsinterface Cloner {  clone(animal: Dog): Dog;  clone(animal: Cat): Cat;  clone(animal: Sheep): Sheep;  clone(animal: Animal): Animal;}
```



Notice that the elements of each group maintains the same order, but the groups themselves are merged with later overload sets ordered first.

One exception to this rule is specialized signatures.
If a signature has a parameter whose type is a single string literal type (e.g. not a union of string literals), then it will be bubbled toward the top of its merged overload list.

For instance, the following interfaces will merge together:



```id
tsinterface Document {  createElement(tagName: any): Element;}interface Document {  createElement(tagName: "div"): HTMLDivElement;  createElement(tagName: "span"): HTMLSpanElement;}interface Document {  createElement(tagName: string): HTMLElement;  createElement(tagName: "canvas"): HTMLCanvasElement;}
```



The resulting merged declaration of `Document` will be the following:



```id
tsinterface Document {  createElement(tagName: "canvas"): HTMLCanvasElement;  createElement(tagName: "div"): HTMLDivElement;  createElement(tagName: "span"): HTMLSpanElement;  createElement(tagName: string): HTMLElement;  createElement(tagName: any): Element;}
```



## Merging Namespaces

Similarly to interfaces, namespaces of the same name will also merge their members.
Since namespaces create both a namespace and a value, we need to understand how both merge.

To merge the namespaces, type definitions from exported interfaces declared in each namespace are themselves merged, forming a single namespace with merged interface definitions inside.

To merge the namespace value, at each declaration site, if a namespace already exists with the given name, it is further extended by taking the existing namespace and adding the exported members of the second namespace to the first.

The declaration merge of `Animals` in this example:



```id
tsnamespace Animals {  export class Zebra {}}namespace Animals {  export interface Legged {    numberOfLegs: number;  }  export class Dog {}}
```



is equivalent to:



```id
tsnamespace Animals {  export interface Legged {    numberOfLegs: number;  }  export class Zebra {}  export class Dog {}}
```



This model of namespace merging is a helpful starting place, but we also need to understand what happens with non-exported members.
Non-exported members are only visible in the original (un-merged) namespace. This means that after merging, merged members that came from other declarations cannot see non-exported members.

We can see this more clearly in this example:



```id
tsnamespace Animal {  let haveMuscles = true;  export function animalsHaveMuscles() {    return haveMuscles;  }}namespace Animal {  export function doAnimalsHaveMuscles() {    return haveMuscles; // Error, because haveMuscles is not accessible here  }}
```



Because `haveMuscles` is not exported, only the `animalsHaveMuscles` function that shares the same un-merged namespace can see the symbol.
The `doAnimalsHaveMuscles` function, even though it’s part of the merged `Animal` namespace can not see this un-exported member.

## Merging Namespaces with Classes, Functions, and Enums

Namespaces are flexible enough to also merge with other types of declarations.
To do so, the namespace declaration must follow the declaration it will merge with. The resulting declaration has properties of both declaration types.
TypeScript uses this capability to model some of the patterns in JavaScript as well as other programming languages.

### Merging Namespaces with Classes

This gives the user a way of describing inner classes.



```id
tsclass Album {  label: Album.AlbumLabel;}namespace Album {  export class AlbumLabel {}}
```



The visibility rules for merged members is the same as described in the Merging Namespaces section, so we must export the `AlbumLabel` class for the merged class to see it.
The end result is a class managed inside of another class.
You can also use namespaces to add more static members to an existing class.

In addition to the pattern of inner classes, you may also be familiar with the JavaScript practice of creating a function and then extending the function further by adding properties onto the function.
TypeScript uses declaration merging to build up definitions like this in a type-safe way.



```id
tsfunction buildLabel(name: string): string {  return buildLabel.prefix + name + buildLabel.suffix;}namespace buildLabel {  export let suffix = "";  export let prefix = "Hello, ";}console.log(buildLabel("Sam Smith"));
```



Similarly, namespaces can be used to extend enums with static members:



```id
tsenum Color {  red = 1,  green = 2,  blue = 4,}namespace Color {  export function mixColor(colorName: string) {    if (colorName == "yellow") {      return Color.red + Color.green;    } else if (colorName == "white") {      return Color.red + Color.green + Color.blue;    } else if (colorName == "magenta") {      return Color.red + Color.blue;    } else if (colorName == "cyan") {      return Color.green + Color.blue;    }  }}
```



## Disallowed Merges

Not all merges are allowed in TypeScript.
Currently, classes can not merge with other classes or with variables.
For information on mimicking class merging, see the Mixins in TypeScript section.

## Module Augmentation

Although JavaScript modules do not support merging, you can patch existing objects by importing and then updating them.
Let’s look at a toy Observable example:



```id
ts// observable.tsexport class Observable<T> {  // ... implementation left as an exercise for the reader ...}// map.tsimport { Observable } from "./observable";Observable.prototype.map = function (f) {  // ... another exercise for the reader};
```



This works fine in TypeScript too, but the compiler doesn’t know about `Observable.prototype.map`.
You can use module augmentation to tell the compiler about it:



```id
ts// observable.tsexport class Observable<T> {  // ... implementation left as an exercise for the reader ...}// map.tsimport { Observable } from "./observable";declare module "./observable" {  interface Observable<T> {    map<U>(f: (x: T) => U): Observable<U>;  }}Observable.prototype.map = function (f) {  // ... another exercise for the reader};// consumer.tsimport { Observable } from "./observable";import "./map";let o: Observable<number>;o.map((x) => x.toFixed());
```



The module name is resolved the same way as module specifiers in `import`/`export`.
See Modules for more information.
Then the declarations in an augmentation are merged as if they were declared in the same file as the original.

However, there are two limitations to keep in mind:

 You can’t declare new top-level declarations in the augmentation — just patches to existing declarations.

- Default exports also cannot be augmented, only named exports (since you need to augment an export by its exported name, and `default` is a reserved word - see #14080 for details)

### Global augmentation

You can also add declarations to the global scope from inside a module:



```id
ts// observable.tsexport class Observable<T> {  // ... still no implementation ...}declare global {  interface Array<T> {    toObservable(): Observable<T>;  }}Array.prototype.toObservable = function () {  // ...};
```



Global augmentations have the same behavior and limits as module augmentations.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Symbols

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/symbols.html

TypeScript: Documentation - Symbols 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Symbols

 

Starting with ECMAScript 2015, `symbol` is a primitive data type, just like `number` and `string`.

`symbol` values are created by calling the `Symbol` constructor.



```id
tslet sym1 = Symbol();let sym2 = Symbol("key"); // optional string key
```



Symbols are immutable, and unique.



```id
tslet sym2 = Symbol("key");let sym3 = Symbol("key");sym2 === sym3; // false, symbols are unique
```



Just like strings, symbols can be used as keys for object properties.



```id
tsconst sym = Symbol();let obj = {  [sym]: "value",};console.log(obj[sym]); // "value"
```



Symbols can also be combined with computed property declarations to declare object properties and class members.



```id
tsconst getClassNameSymbol = Symbol();class C {  [getClassNameSymbol]() {    return "C";  }}let c = new C();let className = c[getClassNameSymbol](); // "C"
```



## `unique symbol`

To enable treating symbols as unique literals a special type `unique symbol` is available. `unique symbol` is a subtype of `symbol`, and are produced only from calling `Symbol()` or `Symbol.for()`, or from explicit type annotations. This type is only allowed on `const` declarations and `readonly static` properties, and in order to reference a specific unique symbol, you’ll have to use the `typeof` operator. Each reference to a unique symbol implies a completely unique identity that’s tied to a given declaration.



```id
tsdeclare const sym1: unique symbol; // sym2 can only be a constant reference.let sym2: unique symbol =  symbol' >Symbol();A variable whose type is a 'unique symbol' type must be 'const'.1332A variable whose type is a 'unique symbol' type must be 'const'. // Works - refers to a unique symbol, but its identity is tied to &apos;sym1&apos;.let sym3: typeof sym1 = sym1; // Also works.class C {  static readonly StaticSymbol: unique symbol =  symbol' >Symbol();}Try
```



Because each `unique symbol` has a completely separate identity, no two `unique symbol` types are assignable or comparable to each other.



```id
tsconst sym2 =  symbol' >Symbol();const sym3 =  symbol' >Symbol(); if (sym2 === sym3) {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof sym2' and 'typeof sym3' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof sym2' and 'typeof sym3' have no overlap.  // ...}Try
```



## Well-known Symbols

In addition to user-defined symbols, there are well-known built-in symbols.
Built-in symbols are used to represent internal language behaviors.

Here is a list of well-known symbols:

### `Symbol.asyncIterator`

A method that returns async iterator for an object, compatible to be used with for await..of loop.

### `Symbol.hasInstance`

A method that determines if a constructor object recognizes an object as one of the constructor’s instances. Called by the semantics of the instanceof operator.

### `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`

A Boolean value indicating that an object should be flattened to its array elements by Array.prototype.concat.

### `Symbol.iterator`

A method that returns the default iterator for an object. Called by the semantics of the for-of statement.

### `Symbol.match`

A regular expression method that matches the regular expression against a string. Called by the `String.prototype.match` method.

### `Symbol.replace`

A regular expression method that replaces matched substrings of a string. Called by the `String.prototype.replace` method.

### `Symbol.search`

A regular expression method that returns the index within a string that matches the regular expression. Called by the `String.prototype.search` method.

### `Symbol.species`

A function valued property that is the constructor function that is used to create derived objects.

### `Symbol.split`

A regular expression method that splits a string at the indices that match the regular expression.
Called by the `String.prototype.split` method.

### `Symbol.toPrimitive`

A method that converts an object to a corresponding primitive value.
Called by the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation.

### `Symbol.toStringTag`

TypeScript: Documentation - Triple-Slash Directives 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Triple-Slash Directives

 

Triple-slash directives are single-line comments containing a single XML tag.
The contents of the comment are used as compiler directives.

Triple-slash directives are only valid at the top of their containing file.
A triple-slash directive can only be preceded by single or multi-line comments, including other triple-slash directives.
If they are encountered following a statement or a declaration they are treated as regular single-line comments, and hold no special meaning.

As of TypeScript 5.5, the compiler does not generate reference directives, and does not emit handwritten triple-slash directives to output files unless those directives are marked as `preserve="true"` .

## `/// `

The `/// ` directive is the most common of this group.
It serves as a declaration of dependency between files.

Triple-slash references instruct the compiler to include additional files in the compilation process.

They also serve as a method to order the output when using `out` or `outFile` .
Files are emitted to the output file location in the same order as the input after preprocessing pass.

### Preprocessing input files

The compiler performs a preprocessing pass on input files to resolve all triple-slash reference directives.
During this process, additional files are added to the compilation.

The process starts with a set of root files ;
these are the file names specified on the command-line or in the `files` list in the `tsconfig.json` file.
These root files are preprocessed in the same order they are specified.
Before a file is added to the list, all triple-slash references in it are processed, and their targets included.
Triple-slash references are resolved in a depth-first manner, in the order they have been seen in the file.

A triple-slash reference path is resolved relative to the containing file, if a relative path is used.

### Errors

It is an error to reference a file that does not exist.
It is an error for a file to have a triple-slash reference to itself.

### Using `--noResolve`

If the compiler flag `noResolve` is specified, triple-slash references are ignored; they neither result in adding new files, nor change the order of the files provided.

## `/// `

Similar to a `/// ` directive, which serves as a declaration of dependency , a `/// ` directive declares a dependency on a package.

The process of resolving these package names is similar to the process of resolving module names in an `import` statement.
An easy way to think of triple-slash-reference-types directives are as an `import` for declaration packages.

For example, including `/// ` in a declaration file declares that this file uses names declared in `@types/node/index.d.ts`;
and thus, this package needs to be included in the compilation along with the declaration file.

For declaring a dependency on an `@types` package in a `.ts` file, use `types` on the command line or in your `tsconfig.json` instead.
See using `@types`, `typeRoots` and `types` in `tsconfig.json` files for more details.

## `/// `

This directive allows a file to explicitly include an existing built-in lib file.

Built-in lib files are referenced in the same fashion as the `lib` compiler option in tsconfig.json (e.g. use `lib="es2015"` and not `lib="lib.es2015.d.ts"`, etc.).

For declaration file authors who rely on built-in types, e.g. DOM APIs or built-in JS run-time constructors like `Symbol` or `Iterable`, triple-slash-reference lib directives are recommended. Previously these .d.ts files had to add forward/duplicate declarations of such types.

For example, adding `/// ` to one of the files in a compilation is equivalent to compiling with `--lib es2017.string`.



```id
ts/// <reference lib="es2017.string" />"foo".padStart(4);
```



## `/// `

This directive marks a file as a default library .
You will see this comment at the top of `lib.d.ts` and its different variants.

This directive instructs the compiler to not include the default library (i.e. `lib.d.ts`) in the compilation.
The impact here is similar to passing `noLib` on the command line.

Also note that when passing `skipDefaultLibCheck` , the compiler will only skip checking files with `/// `.

## `/// `

By default AMD modules are generated anonymous.
This can lead to problems when other tools are used to process the resulting modules, such as bundlers (e.g. `r.js`).

The `amd-module` directive allows passing an optional module name to the compiler:

 amdModule.ts 


```id
ts/// <amd-module name="NamedModule"/>export class C {}
```



Will result in assigning the name `NamedModule` to the module as part of calling the AMD `define`:

 amdModule.js 


```id
jsdefine("NamedModule", ["require", "exports"], function (require, exports) {  var C = (function () {    function C() {}    return C;  })();  exports.C = C;});
```



## `/// `

 

 Note : this directive has been deprecated. Use `import "moduleName";` statements instead.

 

`/// ` informs the compiler about a non-TS module dependency that needs to be injected in the resulting module’s require call.

The `amd-dependency` directive can also have an optional `name` property; this allows passing an optional name for an amd-dependency:



```id
ts/// <amd-dependency path="legacy/moduleA" name="moduleA"/>declare var moduleA: MyType;moduleA.callStuff();
```



Generated JS code:



```id
jsdefine(["require", "exports", "legacy/moduleA"], function (  require,  exports,  moduleA) {  moduleA.callStuff();});
```



## `preserve="true"`

Triple-slash directives can be marked with `preserve="true"` to prevent the compiler from removing them from the output.

For example, these will be erased in the output:



```id
ts/// <reference path="..." />/// <reference types="..." />/// <reference lib="..." />
```



But these will be preserved:



```id
ts/// <reference path="..." preserve="true" />/// <reference types="..." preserve="true" />/// <reference lib="..." preserve="true" />
```

### TypeScript: Handbook - Enums

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#handbook-content

- TypeScript: Handbook - Enums 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Enums

 

Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript.

Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants.
Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases.
TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

## Numeric enums

We’ll first start off with numeric enums, which are probably more familiar if you’re coming from other languages.
An enum can be defined using the `enum` keyword.



```id
tsenum Direction {  Up = 1,  Down,  Left,  Right,}Try
```



Above, we have a numeric enum where `Up` is initialized with `1`.
All of the following members are auto-incremented from that point on.
In other words, `Direction.Up` has the value `1`, `Down` has `2`, `Left` has `3`, and `Right` has `4`.

If we wanted, we could leave off the initializers entirely:



```id
tsenum Direction {  Up,  Down,  Left,  Right,}Try
```



Here, `Up` would have the value `0`, `Down` would have `1`, etc.
This auto-incrementing behavior is useful for cases where we might not care about the member values themselves, but do care that each value is distinct from other values in the same enum.

Using an enum is simple: just access any member as a property off of the enum itself, and declare types using the name of the enum:



```id
tsenum UserResponse {  No = 0,  Yes = 1,} function respond(recipient: string, message: UserResponse): void {  // ...} respond("Princess Caroline", UserResponse.Yes);Try
```



Numeric enums can be mixed in computed and constant members (see below) .
The short story is, enums without initializers either need to be first, or have to come after numeric enums initialized with numeric constants or other constant enum members.
In other words, the following isn’t allowed:



```id
tsenum E {  A =  number' >getSomeValue(),  B,Enum member must have initializer.1061Enum member must have initializer.}Try
```



## String enums

String enums are a similar concept, but have some subtle runtime differences as documented below.
In a string enum, each member has to be constant-initialized with a string literal, or with another string enum member.



```id
tsenum Direction {  Up = "UP",  Down = "DOWN",  Left = "LEFT",  Right = "RIGHT",}Try
```



While string enums don’t have auto-incrementing behavior, string enums have the benefit that they “serialize” well.
In other words, if you were debugging and had to read the runtime value of a numeric enum, the value is often opaque - it doesn’t convey any useful meaning on its own (though reverse mapping can often help). String enums allow you to give a meaningful and readable value when your code runs, independent of the name of the enum member itself.

## Heterogeneous enums

Technically enums can be mixed with string and numeric members, but it’s not clear why you would ever want to do so:



```id
tsenum BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum {  No = 0,  Yes = "YES",}Try
```



Unless you’re really trying to take advantage of JavaScript’s runtime behavior in a clever way, it’s advised that you don’t do this.

## Computed and constant members

Each enum member has a value associated with it which can be either constant or computed .
An enum member is considered constant if:

 

It is the first member in the enum and it has no initializer, in which case it’s assigned the value `0`:



```id
ts// E.X is constant:enum E {  X,}Try
```



- 

It does not have an initializer and the preceding enum member was a numeric constant.
In this case the value of the current enum member will be the value of the preceding enum member plus one.



```id
ts// All enum members in &apos;E1&apos; and &apos;E2&apos; are constant. enum E1 {  X,  Y,  Z,} enum E2 {  A = 1,  B,  C,}Try
```



- 

The enum member is initialized with a constant enum expression.
A constant enum expression is a subset of TypeScript expressions that can be fully evaluated at compile time.
An expression is a constant enum expression if it is:

 a literal enum expression (basically a string literal or a numeric literal)

- a reference to previously defined constant enum member (which can originate from a different enum)

- a parenthesized constant enum expression

- one of the `+`, `-`, `~` unary operators applied to constant enum expression

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, ` >`, `>>>`, `&`, `|`, `^` binary operators with constant enum expressions as operands

It is a compile time error for constant enum expressions to be evaluated to `NaN` or `Infinity`.

 

In all other cases enum member is considered computed.



```id
tsenum FileAccess {  // constant members  None,  Read = 1 << 1,  Write = 1 << 2,  ReadWrite = Read | Write,  // computed member  G = "123".length,}Try
```



## Union enums and enum member types

There is a special subset of constant enum members that aren’t calculated: literal enum members.
A literal enum member is a constant enum member with no initialized value, or with values that are initialized to

- any string literal (e.g. `"foo"`, `"bar"`, `"baz"`)

- any numeric literal (e.g. `1`, `100`)

- a unary minus applied to any numeric literal (e.g. `-1`, `-100`)

When all members in an enum have literal enum values, some special semantics come into play.

The first is that enum members also become types as well!
For example, we can say that certain members can only have the value of an enum member:



```id
tsenum ShapeKind {  Circle,  Square,} interface Circle {  kind: ShapeKind.Circle;  radius: number;} interface Square {  kind: ShapeKind.Square;  sideLength: number;} let c: Circle = {  kind: ShapeKind.Square,Type 'ShapeKind.Square' is not assignable to type 'ShapeKind.Circle'.2322Type 'ShapeKind.Square' is not assignable to type 'ShapeKind.Circle'.  radius: 100,};Try
```



The other change is that enum types themselves effectively become a union of each enum member.
With union enums, the type system is able to leverage the fact that it knows the exact set of values that exist in the enum itself.
Because of that, TypeScript can catch bugs where we might be comparing values incorrectly.
For example:



```id
tsenum E {  Foo,  Bar,} function f(x: E) {  if (x !== E.Foo || x !== E.Bar) {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'E.Foo' and 'E.Bar' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'E.Foo' and 'E.Bar' have no overlap.    //  }}Try
```



In that example, we first checked whether `x` was not `E.Foo`.
If that check succeeds, then our `||` will short-circuit, and the body of the ‘if’ will run.
However, if the check didn’t succeed, then `x` can only be `E.Foo`, so it doesn’t make sense to see whether it’s not equal to `E.Bar`.

## Enums at runtime

Enums are real objects that exist at runtime.
For example, the following enum



```id
tsenum E {  X,  Y,  Z,}Try
```



can actually be passed around to functions



```id
tsenum E {  X,  Y,  Z,} function f(obj: { X: number }) {  return obj.X;} // Works, since &apos;E&apos; has a property named &apos;X&apos; which is a number.f(E);Try
```



## Enums at compile time

Even though Enums are real objects that exist at runtime, the `keyof` keyword works differently than you might expect for typical objects. Instead, use `keyof typeof` to get a Type that represents all Enum keys as strings.



```id
tsenum LogLevel {  ERROR,  WARN,  INFO,  DEBUG,} /** * This is equivalent to: * type LogLevelStrings = &apos;ERROR&apos; | &apos;WARN&apos; | &apos;INFO&apos; | &apos;DEBUG&apos;; */type LogLevelStrings = keyof typeof LogLevel; function printImportant(key: LogLevelStrings, message: string) {  const num = LogLevel[key];  if (num <= LogLevel.WARN) {    console.log("Log level key is:", key);    console.log("Log level value is:", num);    console.log("Log level message is:", message);  }}printImportant("ERROR", "This is a message");Try
```



### Reverse mappings

In addition to creating an object with property names for members, numeric enums members also get a reverse mapping from enum values to enum names.
For example, in this example:



```id
tsenum Enum {  A,} let a = Enum.A;let nameOfA = Enum[a]; // "A"Try
```



TypeScript compiles this down to the following JavaScript:



```id
ts"use strict";var Enum;(function (Enum) {    Enum[Enum["A"] = 0] = "A";})(Enum || (Enum = {}));let a = Enum.A;let nameOfA = Enum[a]; // "A" Try
```



In this generated code, an enum is compiled into an object that stores both forward (`name` -> `value`) and reverse (`value` -> `name`) mappings.
References to other enum members are always emitted as property accesses and never inlined.

Keep in mind that string enum members do not get a reverse mapping generated at all.

### `const` enums

In most cases, enums are a perfectly valid solution.
However sometimes requirements are tighter.
To avoid paying the cost of extra generated code and additional indirection when accessing enum values, it’s possible to use `const` enums.
Const enums are defined using the `const` modifier on our enums:



```id
tsconst enum Enum {  A = 1,  B = A * 2,}Try
```



Const enums can only use constant enum expressions and unlike regular enums they are completely removed during compilation.
Const enum members are inlined at use sites.
This is possible since const enums cannot have computed members.



```id
tsconst enum Direction {  Up,  Down,  Left,  Right,} let directions = [  Direction.Up,  Direction.Down,  Direction.Left,  Direction.Right,];Try
```



in generated code will become



```id
ts"use strict";let directions = [    0 /* Direction.Up */,    1 /* Direction.Down */,    2 /* Direction.Left */,    3 /* Direction.Right */,]; Try
```



#### Const enum pitfalls

Inlining enum values is straightforward at first, but comes with subtle implications.
These pitfalls pertain to ambient const enums only (basically const enums in `.d.ts` files) and sharing them between projects, but if you are publishing or consuming `.d.ts` files, these pitfalls likely apply to you, because `tsc --declaration` transforms `.ts` files into `.d.ts` files.

- For the reasons laid out in the `isolatedModules` documentation , that mode is fundamentally incompatible with ambient const enums.
This means if you publish ambient const enums, downstream consumers will not be able to use `isolatedModules` and those enum values at the same time.

- You can easily inline values from version A of a dependency at compile time, and import version B at runtime.
Version A and B’s enums can have different values, if you are not very careful, resulting in surprising bugs , like taking the wrong branches of `if` statements.
These bugs are especially pernicious because it is common to run automated tests at roughly the same time as projects are built, with the same dependency versions, which misses these bugs completely.

- `importsNotUsedAsValues: "preserve"` will not elide imports for const enums used as values, but ambient const enums do not guarantee that runtime `.js` files exist.
The unresolvable imports cause errors at runtime.
The usual way to unambiguously elide imports, type-only imports , does not allow const enum values , currently.

Here are two approaches to avoiding these pitfalls:

- 

Do not use const enums at all.
You can easily ban const enums with the help of a linter.
Obviously this avoids any issues with const enums, but prevents your project from inlining its own enums.
Unlike inlining enums from other projects, inlining a project’s own enums is not problematic and has performance implications.

- 

Do not publish ambient const enums, by deconstifying them with the help of `preserveConstEnums` .
This is the approach taken internally by the TypeScript project itself .
 `preserveConstEnums` emits the same JavaScript for const enums as plain enums.
You can then safely strip the `const` modifier from `.d.ts` files in a build step .

This way downstream consumers will not inline enums from your project, avoiding the pitfalls above, but a project can still inline its own enums, unlike banning const enums entirely.

## Ambient enums

Ambient enums are used to describe the shape of already existing enum types.



```id
tsdeclare enum Enum {  A = 1,  B,  C = 2,}Try
```



One important difference between ambient and non-ambient enums is that, in regular enums, members that don’t have an initializer will be considered constant if its preceding enum member is considered constant.
By contrast, an ambient (and non-const) enum member that does not have an initializer is always considered computed.

## Objects vs Enums

In modern TypeScript, you may not need an enum when an object with `as const` could suffice:



```id
tsconst enum EDirection {  Up,  Down,  Left,  Right,} const ODirection = {  Up: 0,  Down: 1,  Left: 2,  Right: 3,} as const; EDirection.Up;           (enum member) EDirection.Up = 0 ODirection.Up;           (property) Up: 0 // Using the enum as a parameterfunction walk(dir: EDirection) {} // It requires an extra line to pull out the valuestype Direction = typeof ODirection[keyof typeof ODirection];function run(dir: Direction) {} walk(EDirection.Left);run(ODirection.Right);Try
```



The biggest argument in favour of this format over TypeScript’s `enum` is that it keeps your codebase aligned with the state of JavaScript, and when/if enums are added to JavaScript then you can move to the additional syntax.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Type Compatibility

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - Type Compatibility 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Type Compatibility

 

Type compatibility in TypeScript is based on structural subtyping.
Structural typing is a way of relating types based solely on their members.
This is in contrast with nominal typing.
Consider the following code:



```id
tsinterface Pet {  name: string;}class Dog {  name: string;}let pet: Pet;// OK, because of structural typingpet = new Dog();
```



In nominally-typed languages like C# or Java, the equivalent code would be an error because the `Dog` class does not explicitly describe itself as being an implementer of the `Pet` interface.

TypeScript’s structural type system was designed based on how JavaScript code is typically written.
Because JavaScript widely uses anonymous objects like function expressions and object literals, it’s much more natural to represent the kinds of relationships found in JavaScript libraries with a structural type system instead of a nominal one.

## A Note on Soundness

TypeScript’s type system allows certain operations that can’t be known at compile-time to be safe. When a type system has this property, it is said to not be “sound”. The places where TypeScript allows unsound behavior were carefully considered, and throughout this document we’ll explain where these happen and the motivating scenarios behind them.

## Starting out

The basic rule for TypeScript’s structural type system is that `x` is compatible with `y` if `y` has at least the same members as `x`. For example consider the following code involving an interface named `Pet` which has a `name` property:



```id
tsinterface Pet {  name: string;}let pet: Pet;// dog's inferred type is { name: string; owner: string; }let dog = { name: "Lassie", owner: "Rudd Weatherwax" };pet = dog;
```



To check whether `dog` can be assigned to `pet`, the compiler checks each property of `pet` to find a corresponding compatible property in `dog`.
In this case, `dog` must have a member called `name` that is a string. It does, so the assignment is allowed.

The same rule for assignment is used when checking function call arguments:



```id
tsinterface Pet {  name: string;}let dog = { name: "Lassie", owner: "Rudd Weatherwax" };function greet(pet: Pet) {  console.log("Hello, " + pet.name);}greet(dog); // OK
```



Note that `dog` has an extra `owner` property, but this does not create an error.
Only members of the target type (`Pet` in this case) are considered when
checking for compatibility. This comparison process proceeds recursively,
exploring the type of each member and sub-member.

Be aware, however, that object literals may only specify known properties .
For example, because we have explicitly specified that `dog` is
of type `Pet`, the following code is invalid:



```id
tslet dog: Pet = { name: "Lassie", owner: "Rudd Weatherwax" }; // Error
```



## Comparing two functions

While comparing primitive types and object types is relatively straightforward, the question of what kinds of functions should be considered compatible is a bit more involved.
Let’s start with a basic example of two functions that differ only in their parameter lists:



```id
tslet x = (a: number) => 0;let y = (b: number, s: string) => 0;y = x; // OKx = y; // Error
```



To check if `x` is assignable to `y`, we first look at the parameter list.
Each parameter in `x` must have a corresponding parameter in `y` with a compatible type.
Note that the names of the parameters are not considered, only their types.
In this case, every parameter of `x` has a corresponding compatible parameter in `y`, so the assignment is allowed.

The second assignment is an error, because `y` has a required second parameter that `x` does not have, so the assignment is disallowed.

You may be wondering why we allow ‘discarding’ parameters like in the example `y = x`.
The reason for this assignment to be allowed is that ignoring extra function parameters is actually quite common in JavaScript.
For example, `Array#forEach` provides three parameters to the callback function: the array element, its index, and the containing array.
Nevertheless, it’s very useful to provide a callback that only uses the first parameter:



```id
tslet items = [1, 2, 3];// Don't force these extra parametersitems.forEach((item, index, array) => console.log(item));// Should be OK!items.forEach((item) => console.log(item));
```



Now let’s look at how return types are treated, using two functions that differ only by their return type:



```id
tslet x = () => ({ name: "Alice" });let y = () => ({ name: "Alice", location: "Seattle" });x = y; // OKy = x; // Error, because x() lacks a location property
```



The type system enforces that the source function’s return type be a subtype of the target type’s return type.

### Function Parameter Bivariance

When comparing the types of function parameters, assignment succeeds if either the source parameter is assignable to the target parameter, or vice versa.
This is unsound because a caller might end up being given a function that takes a more specialized type, but invokes the function with a less specialized type.
In practice, this sort of error is rare, and allowing this enables many common JavaScript patterns. A brief example:



```id
tsenum EventType {  Mouse,  Keyboard,}interface Event {  timestamp: number;}interface MyMouseEvent extends Event {  x: number;  y: number;}interface MyKeyEvent extends Event {  keyCode: number;}function listenEvent(eventType: EventType, handler: (n: Event) => void) {  /* ... */}// Unsound, but useful and commonlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: MyMouseEvent) => console.log(e.x + "," + e.y));// Undesirable alternatives in presence of soundnesslistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: Event) =>  console.log((e as MyMouseEvent).x + "," + (e as MyMouseEvent).y));listenEvent(EventType.Mouse, ((e: MyMouseEvent) =>  console.log(e.x + "," + e.y)) as (e: Event) => void);// Still disallowed (clear error). Type safety enforced for wholly incompatible typeslistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: number) => console.log(e));
```



You can have TypeScript raise errors when this happens via the compiler flag `strictFunctionTypes` .

### Optional Parameters and Rest Parameters

When comparing functions for compatibility, optional and required parameters are interchangeable.
Extra optional parameters of the source type are not an error, and optional parameters of the target type without corresponding parameters in the source type are not an error.

When a function has a rest parameter, it is treated as if it were an infinite series of optional parameters.

This is unsound from a type system perspective, but from a runtime point of view the idea of an optional parameter is generally not well-enforced since passing `undefined` in that position is equivalent for most functions.

The motivating example is the common pattern of a function that takes a callback and invokes it with some predictable (to the programmer) but unknown (to the type system) number of arguments:



```id
tsfunction invokeLater(args: any[], callback: (...args: any[]) => void) {  /* ... Invoke callback with 'args' ... */}// Unsound - invokeLater "might" provide any number of argumentsinvokeLater([1, 2], (x, y) => console.log(x + ", " + y));// Confusing (x and y are actually required) and undiscoverableinvokeLater([1, 2], (x?, y?) => console.log(x + ", " + y));
```



### Functions with overloads

When a function has overloads, each overload in the target type must be matched by a compatible signature on the source type.
This ensures that the source function can be called in all the same cases as the target function.

## Enums

Enums are compatible with numbers, and numbers are compatible with enums. Enum values from different enum types are considered incompatible. For example,



```id
tsenum Status {  Ready,  Waiting,}enum Color {  Red,  Blue,  Green,}let status = Status.Ready;status = Color.Green; // Error
```



## Classes

Classes work similarly to object literal types and interfaces with one exception: they have both a static and an instance type.
When comparing two objects of a class type, only members of the instance are compared.
Static members and constructors do not affect compatibility.



```id
tsclass Animal {  feet: number;  constructor(name: string, numFeet: number) {}}class Size {  feet: number;  constructor(numFeet: number) {}}let a: Animal;let s: Size;a = s; // OKs = a; // OK
```



### Private and protected members in classes

Private and protected members in a class affect their compatibility.
When an instance of a class is checked for compatibility, if the target type contains a private member, then the source type must also contain a private member that originated from the same class.
Likewise, the same applies for an instance with a protected member.
This allows a class to be assignment compatible with its super class, but not with classes from a different inheritance hierarchy which otherwise have the same shape.

## Generics

Because TypeScript is a structural type system, type parameters only affect the resulting type when consumed as part of the type of a member. For example,



```id
tsinterface Empty<T> {}let x: Empty<number>;let y: Empty<string>;x = y; // OK, because y matches structure of x
```



In the above, `x` and `y` are compatible because their structures do not use the type argument in a differentiating way.
Changing this example by adding a member to `Empty ` shows how this works:



```id
tsinterface NotEmpty<T> {  data: T;}let x: NotEmpty<number>;let y: NotEmpty<string>;x = y; // Error, because x and y are not compatible
```



In this way, a generic type that has its type arguments specified acts just like a non-generic type.

For generic types that do not have their type arguments specified, compatibility is checked by specifying `any` in place of all unspecified type arguments.
The resulting types are then checked for compatibility, just as in the non-generic case.

For example,



```id
tslet identity = function <T>(x: T): T {  // ...};let reverse = function <U>(y: U): U {  // ...};identity = reverse; // OK, because (x: any) => any matches (y: any) => any
```



## Advanced Topics

### Subtype vs Assignment

So far, we’ve used “compatible”, which is not a term defined in the language spec.
In TypeScript, there are two kinds of compatibility: subtype and assignment.
These differ only in that assignment extends subtype compatibility with rules to allow assignment to and from `any`, and to and from `enum` with corresponding numeric values.

Different places in the language use one of the two compatibility mechanisms, depending on the situation.
For practical purposes, type compatibility is dictated by assignment compatibility, even in the cases of the `implements` and `extends` clauses.

## `any`, `unknown`, `object`, `void`, `undefined`, `null`, and `never` assignability

The following table summarizes assignability between some abstract types.

Reiterating The Basics :

 Everything is assignable to itself.

- `any` and `unknown` are the same in terms of what is assignable to them, different in that `unknown` is not assignable to anything except `any`.

- `unknown` and `never` are like inverses of each other.
Everything is assignable to `unknown`, `never` is assignable to everything.
Nothing is assignable to `never`, `unknown` is not assignable to anything (except `any`).

- `void` is not assignable to or from anything, with the following exceptions: `any`, `unknown`, `never`, `undefined`, and `null` (if `strictNullChecks` is off, see table for details).

- When `strictNullChecks` is off, `null` and `undefined` are similar to `never`: assignable to most types, most types are not assignable to them.
They are assignable to each other.

- When `strictNullChecks` is on, `null` and `undefined` behave more like `void`: not assignable to or from anything, except for `any`, `unknown`, and `void` (`undefined` is always assignable to `void`).

# Iterators and Generators

 

## Iterables

An object is deemed iterable if it has an implementation for the `Symbol.iterator` property.
Some built-in types like `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `String`, `Int32Array`, `Uint32Array`, etc. have their `Symbol.iterator` property already implemented.
`Symbol.iterator` function on an object is responsible for returning the list of values to iterate on.

### `Iterable` interface

`Iterable` is a type we can use if we want to take in types listed above which are iterable. Here is an example:



```id
tsfunction toArray<X>(xs: Iterable<X>): X[] {  return [...xs]}
```



### `for..of` statements

`for..of` loops over an iterable object, invoking the `Symbol.iterator` property on the object.
Here is a simple `for..of` loop on an array:



```id
tslet someArray = [1, "string", false];for (let entry of someArray) {  console.log(entry); // 1, "string", false}
```



### `for..of` vs. `for..in` statements

Both `for..of` and `for..in` statements iterate over lists; the values iterated on are different though, `for..in` returns a list of keys on the object being iterated, whereas `for..of` returns a list of values of the numeric properties of the object being iterated.

Here is an example that demonstrates this distinction:



```id
tslet list = [4, 5, 6];for (let i in list) {  console.log(i); // "0", "1", "2",}for (let i of list) {  console.log(i); // 4, 5, 6}
```



Another distinction is that `for..in` operates on any object; it serves as a way to inspect properties on this object.
`for..of` on the other hand, is mainly interested in values of iterable objects. Built-in objects like `Map` and `Set` implement `Symbol.iterator` property allowing access to stored values.



```id
tslet pets = new Set(["Cat", "Dog", "Hamster"]);pets["species"] = "mammals";for (let pet in pets) {  console.log(pet); // "species"}for (let pet of pets) {  console.log(pet); // "Cat", "Dog", "Hamster"}
```



### Code generation

#### Targeting ES5

When targeting an ES5-compliant engine, iterators are only allowed on values of `Array` type.
It is an error to use `for..of` loops on non-Array values, even if these non-Array values implement the `Symbol.iterator` property.

The compiler will generate a simple `for` loop for a `for..of` loop, for instance:



```id
tslet numbers = [1, 2, 3];for (let num of numbers) {  console.log(num);}
```



will be generated as:



```id
jsvar numbers = [1, 2, 3];for (var _i = 0; _i < numbers.length; _i++) {  var num = numbers[_i];  console.log(num);}
```



#### Targeting ECMAScript 2015 and higher

When targeting an ECMAScript 2015-compliant engine, the compiler will generate `for..of` loops to target the built-in iterator implementation in the engine.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Type Inference

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html

TypeScript: Documentation - Type Inference

# Type Inference

 

In TypeScript, there are several places where type inference is used to provide type information when there is no explicit type annotation. For example, in this code



```id
tslet x = 3;   let x: numberTry
```



The type of the `x` variable is inferred to be `number`.
This kind of inference takes place when initializing variables and members, setting parameter default values, and determining function return types.

In most cases, type inference is straightforward.
In the following sections, we’ll explore some of the nuances in how types are inferred.

## Best common type

When a type inference is made from several expressions, the types of those expressions are used to calculate a “best common type”. For example,



```id
tslet x = [0, 1, null];   let x: (number | null)[]Try
```



To infer the type of `x` in the example above, we must consider the type of each array element.
Here we are given two choices for the type of the array: `number` and `null`.
The best common type algorithm considers each candidate type, and picks the type that is compatible with all the other candidates.

Because the best common type has to be chosen from the provided candidate types, there are some cases where types share a common structure, but no one type is the super type of all candidate types. For example:



```id
tslet zoo = [new Rhino(), new Elephant(), new Snake()];    let zoo: (Rhino | Elephant | Snake)[]Try
```



Ideally, we may want `zoo` to be inferred as an `Animal[]`, but because there is no object that is strictly of type `Animal` in the array, we make no inference about the array element type.
To correct this, explicitly provide the type when no one type is a super type of all other candidates:



```id
tslet zoo: Animal[] = [new Rhino(), new Elephant(), new Snake()];    let zoo: Animal[]Try
```



When no best common type is found, the resulting inference is the union array type, `(Rhino | Elephant | Snake)[]`.

## Contextual Typing

Type inference also works in “the other direction” in some cases in TypeScript.
This is known as “contextual typing”. Contextual typing occurs when the type of an expression is implied by its location. For example:



```id
tswindow. any) & ((this: Window, ev: MouseEvent) => any)) | null' >onmousedown = function (mouseEvent) {  console.log(mouseEvent.button);  console.log(mouseEvent.kangaroo);Property 'kangaroo' does not exist on type 'MouseEvent'.2339Property 'kangaroo' does not exist on type 'MouseEvent'.};Try
```



Here, the TypeScript type checker used the type of the `Window.onmousedown` function to infer the type of the function expression on the right hand side of the assignment.
When it did so, it was able to infer the type of the `mouseEvent` parameter, which does contain a `button` property, but not a `kangaroo` property.

This works because window already has `onmousedown` declared in its type:



```id
ts// Declares there is a global variable called 'window'declare var window: Window & typeof globalThis;// Which is declared as (simplified):interface Window extends GlobalEventHandlers {  // ...}// Which defines a lot of known handler eventsinterface GlobalEventHandlers {  onmousedown: ((this: GlobalEventHandlers, ev: MouseEvent) => any) | null;  // ...}
```



TypeScript is smart enough to infer types in other contexts as well:



```id
tswindow. any) & ((this: Window, ev: Event) => any)) | null' >onscroll = function (uiEvent) {  console.log(uiEvent.button);Property 'button' does not exist on type 'Event'.2339Property 'button' does not exist on type 'Event'.};Try
```



Based on the fact that the above function is being assigned to `Window.onscroll`, TypeScript knows that `uiEvent` is a UIEvent , and not a MouseEvent like the previous example. `UIEvent` objects contain no `button` property, and so TypeScript will throw an error.

If this function were not in a contextually typed position, the function’s argument would implicitly have type `any`, and no error would be issued (unless you are using the `noImplicitAny` option):



```id
tsconst  void' >handler = function (uiEvent) {  console.log(uiEvent.button); // <- OK};Try
```



We can also explicitly give type information to the function’s argument to override any contextual type:



```id
tswindow. any) & ((this: Window, ev: Event) => any)) | null' >onscroll = function (uiEvent: any) {  console.log(uiEvent.button); // <- Now, no error is given};Try
```



However, this code will log `undefined`, since `uiEvent` has no property called `button`.

Contextual typing applies in many cases.
Common cases include arguments to function calls, right hand sides of assignments, type assertions, members of object and array literals, and return statements.
The contextual type also acts as a candidate type in best common type. For example:



```id
tsfunction createZoo(): Animal[] {  return [new Rhino(), new Elephant(), new Snake()];}Try
```



In this example, best common type has a set of four candidates: `Animal`, `Rhino`, `Elephant`, and `Snake`.
Of these, `Animal` can be chosen by the best common type algorithm.

### TypeScript: Documentation - JSX

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#handbook-content

- TypeScript: Documentation - JSX 

Was this page helpful?

 

# JSX

 

 JSX is an embeddable XML-like syntax.
It is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript, though the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific.
JSX rose to popularity with the React framework, but has since seen other implementations as well.
TypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and compiling JSX directly to JavaScript.

## Basic usage

In order to use JSX you must do two things.

 Name your files with a `.tsx` extension

- Enable the `jsx` option

TypeScript ships with several JSX modes: `preserve`, `react` (classic runtime), `react-jsx` (automatic runtime), `react-jsxdev` (automatic development runtime), and `react-native`.
The `preserve` mode will keep the JSX as part of the output to be further consumed by another transform step (e.g. Babel ).
Additionally the output will have a `.jsx` file extension.
The `react` mode will emit `React.createElement`, does not need to go through a JSX transformation before use, and the output will have a `.js` file extension.
The `react-native` mode is the equivalent of `preserve` in that it keeps all JSX, but the output will instead have a `.js` file extension.

 
 
 
 Mode 
 Input 
 Output 
 Output File Extension 
 
 
 
 
 `preserve` 
 ` ` 
 ` ` 
 `.jsx` 
 
 
 `react` 
 ` ` 
 `React.createElement("div")` 
 `.js` 
 
 
 `react-native` 
 ` ` 
 ` ` 
 `.js` 
 
 
 `react-jsx` 
 ` ` 
 `_jsx("div", {}, void 0);` 
 `.js` 
 
 
 `react-jsxdev` 
 ` ` 
 `_jsxDEV("div", {}, void 0, false, {...}, this);` 
 `.js` 
 
 
 

You can specify this mode using either the `jsx` command line flag or the corresponding option `jsx` in your tsconfig.json file.

 

*Note: You can specify the JSX factory function to use when targeting react JSX emit with `jsxFactory` option (defaults to `React.createElement`)

 

## The `as` operator

Recall how to write a type assertion:



```id
tsconst foo = <Foo>bar;
```



This asserts the variable `bar` to have the type `Foo`.
Since TypeScript also uses angle brackets for type assertions, combining it with JSX’s syntax would introduce certain parsing difficulties. As a result, TypeScript disallows angle bracket type assertions in `.tsx` files.

Since the above syntax cannot be used in `.tsx` files, an alternate type assertion operator should be used: `as`.
The example can easily be rewritten with the `as` operator.



```id
tsconst foo = bar as Foo;
```



The `as` operator is available in both `.ts` and `.tsx` files, and is identical in behavior to the angle-bracket type assertion style.

## Type Checking

In order to understand type checking with JSX, you must first understand the difference between intrinsic elements and value-based elements.
Given a JSX expression ` `, `expr` may either refer to something intrinsic to the environment (e.g. a `div` or `span` in a DOM environment) or to a custom component that you’ve created.
This is important for two reasons:

- For React, intrinsic elements are emitted as strings (`React.createElement("div")`), whereas a component you’ve created is not (`React.createElement(MyComponent)`).

- The types of the attributes being passed in the JSX element should be looked up differently.
Intrinsic element attributes should be known intrinsically whereas components will likely want to specify their own set of attributes.

TypeScript uses the same convention that React does for distinguishing between these.
An intrinsic element always begins with a lowercase letter, and a value-based element always begins with an uppercase letter.

### The `JSX` namespace

JSX in TypeScript is typed by the `JSX` namespace. The `JSX` namespace may be defined in various places, depending on the `jsx` compiler option.

The `jsx` options `preserve`, `react`, and `react-native` use the type definitions for classic runtime. This means a variable needs to be in scope that’s determined by the `jsxFactory` compiler option. The `JSX` namespace should be specified on the top-most identifier of the JSX factory. For example, React uses the default factory `React.createElement`. This means its `JSX` namespace should be defined as `React.JSX`.



```id
tsexport function createElement(): any;export namespace JSX {  // …}
```



And the user should always import React as `React`.



```id
tsimport * as React from 'react';
```



Preact uses the JSX factory `h`. That means its types should be defined as the `h.JSX`.



```id
tsexport function h(props: any): any;export namespace h.JSX {  // …}
```



The user should use a named import to import `h`.



```id
tsimport { h } from 'preact';
```



For the `jsx` options `react-jsx` and `react-jsxdev`, the `JSX` namespace should be exported from the matching entry points. For `react-jsx` this is `${jsxImportSource}/jsx-runtime`. For `react-jsxdev`, this is `${jsxImportSource}/jsx-dev-runtime`. Since these don’t use a file extension, you must use the `exports` field in `package.json` map in order to support ESM users.



```id
json{  "exports": {    "./jsx-runtime": "./jsx-runtime.js",    "./jsx-dev-runtime": "./jsx-dev-runtime.js",  }}
```



Then in `jsx-runtime.d.ts` and `jsx-dev-runtime.d.ts`:



```id
tsexport namespace JSX {  // …}
```



Note that while exporting the `JSX` namespace is sufficient for type checking, the production runtime needs the `jsx`, `jsxs`, and `Fragment` exports at runtime, and the development runtime needs `jsxDEV` and `Fragment`. Ideally you add types for those too.

If the `JSX` namespace isn’t available in the appropriate location, both the classic and the automatic runtime fall back to the global `JSX` namespace.

### Intrinsic elements

Intrinsic elements are looked up on the special interface `JSX.IntrinsicElements`.
By default, if this interface is not specified, then anything goes and intrinsic elements will not be type checked.
However, if this interface is present, then the name of the intrinsic element is looked up as a property on the `JSX.IntrinsicElements` interface.
For example:



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface IntrinsicElements {    foo: any;  }}<foo />; // ok<bar />; // error
```



In the above example, ` ` will work fine but ` ` will result in an error since it has not been specified on `JSX.IntrinsicElements`.

 

Note: You can also specify a catch-all string indexer on `JSX.IntrinsicElements` as follows:

 


```id
tsdeclare namespace JSX {  interface IntrinsicElements {    [elemName: string]: any;  }}
```



### Value-based elements

Value-based elements are simply looked up by identifiers that are in scope.



```id
tsximport MyComponent from "./myComponent";<MyComponent />; // ok<SomeOtherComponent />; // error
```



There are two ways to define a value-based element:

- Function Component (FC)

- Class Component

Because these two types of value-based elements are indistinguishable from each other in a JSX expression, first TS tries to resolve the expression as a Function Component using overload resolution. If the process succeeds, then TS finishes resolving the expression to its declaration. If the value fails to resolve as a Function Component, TS will then try to resolve it as a class component. If that fails, TS will report an error.

#### Function Component

As the name suggests, the component is defined as a JavaScript function where its first argument is a `props` object.
TS enforces that its return type must be assignable to `JSX.Element`.



```id
tsxinterface FooProp {  name: string;  X: number;  Y: number;}declare function AnotherComponent(prop: { name: string });function ComponentFoo(prop: FooProp) {  return <AnotherComponent name={prop.name} />;}const Button = (prop: { value: string }, context: { color: string }) => (  <button />);
```



Because a Function Component is simply a JavaScript function, function overloads may be used here as well:



```id
tsinterface ClickableProps {  children: JSX.Element[] | JSX.Element;} interface HomeProps extends ClickableProps {  home: JSX.Element;} interface SideProps extends ClickableProps {  side: JSX.Element | string;} function MainButton(prop: HomeProps): JSX.Element;function MainButton(prop: SideProps): JSX.Element;function MainButton(prop: ClickableProps): JSX.Element {  // ...}Try
```


 

Note: Function Components were formerly known as Stateless Function Components (SFC). As Function Components can no longer be considered stateless in recent versions of react, the type `SFC` and its alias `StatelessComponent` were deprecated.

 

#### Class Component

It is possible to define the type of a class component.
However, to do so it is best to understand two new terms: the element class type and the element instance type .

Given ` `, the element class type is the type of `Expr`.
So in the example above, if `MyComponent` was an ES6 class the class type would be that class’s constructor and statics.
If `MyComponent` was a factory function, the class type would be that function.

Once the class type is established, the instance type is determined by the union of the return types of the class type’s construct or call signatures (whichever is present).
So again, in the case of an ES6 class, the instance type would be the type of an instance of that class, and in the case of a factory function, it would be the type of the value returned from the function.



```id
tsclass MyComponent {  render() {}}// use a construct signatureconst myComponent = new MyComponent();// element class type => MyComponent// element instance type => { render: () => void }function MyFactoryFunction() {  return {    render: () => {},  };}// use a call signatureconst myComponent = MyFactoryFunction();// element class type => MyFactoryFunction// element instance type => { render: () => void }
```



The element instance type is interesting because it must be assignable to `JSX.ElementClass` or it will result in an error.
By default `JSX.ElementClass` is `{}`, but it can be augmented to limit the use of JSX to only those types that conform to the proper interface.



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface ElementClass {    render: any;  }}class MyComponent {  render() {}}function MyFactoryFunction() {  return { render: () => {} };}<MyComponent />; // ok<MyFactoryFunction />; // okclass NotAValidComponent {}function NotAValidFactoryFunction() {  return {};}<NotAValidComponent />; // error<NotAValidFactoryFunction />; // error
```



### Attribute type checking

The first step to type checking attributes is to determine the element attributes type .
This is slightly different between intrinsic and value-based elements.

For intrinsic elements, it is the type of the property on `JSX.IntrinsicElements`



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface IntrinsicElements {    foo: { bar?: boolean };  }}// element attributes type for 'foo' is '{bar?: boolean}'<foo bar />;
```



For value-based elements, it is a bit more complex.
It is determined by the type of a property on the element instance type that was previously determined.
Which property to use is determined by `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty`.
It should be declared with a single property.
The name of that property is then used.
As of TypeScript 2.8, if `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty` is not provided, the type of first parameter of the class element’s constructor or Function Component’s call will be used instead.



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface ElementAttributesProperty {    props; // specify the property name to use  }}class MyComponent {  // specify the property on the element instance type  props: {    foo?: string;  };}// element attributes type for 'MyComponent' is '{foo?: string}'<MyComponent foo="bar" />;
```



The element attribute type is used to type check the attributes in the JSX.
Optional and required properties are supported.



```id
tsxdeclare namespace JSX {  interface IntrinsicElements {    foo: { requiredProp: string; optionalProp?: number };  }}<foo requiredProp="bar" />; // ok<foo requiredProp="bar" optionalProp={0} />; // ok<foo />; // error, requiredProp is missing<foo requiredProp={0} />; // error, requiredProp should be a string<foo requiredProp="bar" unknownProp />; // error, unknownProp does not exist<foo requiredProp="bar" some-unknown-prop />; // ok, because 'some-unknown-prop' is not a valid identifier
```


 

Note: If an attribute name is not a valid JS identifier (like a `data-*` attribute), it is not considered to be an error if it is not found in the element attributes type.

 

Additionally, the `JSX.IntrinsicAttributes` interface can be used to specify extra properties used by the JSX framework which are not generally used by the components’ props or arguments - for instance `key` in React. Specializing further, the generic `JSX.IntrinsicClassAttributes ` type may also be used to specify the same kind of extra attributes just for class components (and not Function Components). In this type, the generic parameter corresponds to the class instance type. In React, this is used to allow the `ref` attribute of type `Ref `. Generally speaking, all of the properties on these interfaces should be optional, unless you intend that users of your JSX framework need to provide some attribute on every tag.

The spread operator also works:



```id
tsxconst props = { requiredProp: "bar" };<foo {...props} />; // okconst badProps = {};<foo {...badProps} />; // error
```



### Children Type Checking

In TypeScript 2.3, TS introduced type checking of children . children is a special property in an element attributes type where child JSXExpression s are taken to be inserted into the attributes.
Similar to how TS uses `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty` to determine the name of props , TS uses `JSX.ElementChildrenAttribute` to determine the name of children within those props.
`JSX.ElementChildrenAttribute` should be declared with a single property.



```id
tsdeclare namespace JSX {  interface ElementChildrenAttribute {    children: {}; // specify children name to use  }}
```




```id
tsx<div>  <h1>Hello</h1></div>;<div>  <h1>Hello</h1>  World</div>;const CustomComp = (props) => <div>{props.children}</div><CustomComp>  <div>Hello World</div>  {"This is just a JS expression..." + 1000}</CustomComp>
```



You can specify the type of children like any other attribute. This will override the default type from, e.g. the React typings if you use them.



```id
tsxinterface PropsType {  children: JSX.Element  name: string}class Component extends React.Component<PropsType, {}> {  render() {    return (      <h2>        {this.props.children}      </h2>    )  }}// OK<Component name="foo">  <h1>Hello World</h1></Component>// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element<Component name="bar">  <h1>Hello World</h1>  <h2>Hello World</h2></Component>// Error: children is of type JSX.Element not array of JSX.Element or string.<Component name="baz">  <h1>Hello</h1>  World</Component>
```



## The JSX result type

By default the result of a JSX expression is typed as `any`.
You can customize the type by specifying the `JSX.Element` interface.
However, it is not possible to retrieve type information about the element, attributes or children of the JSX from this interface.
It is a black box.

## The JSX function return type

By default, function components must return `JSX.Element | null`. However, this doesn’t always represent runtime behaviour. As of TypeScript 5.1, you can specify `JSX.ElementType` to override what is a valid JSX component type. Note that this doesn’t define what props are valid. The type of props is always defined by the first argument of the component that’s passed. The default looks something like this:



```id
tsnamespace JSX {    export type ElementType =        // All the valid lowercase tags        | keyof IntrinsicElements        // Function components        | (props: any) => Element        // Class components        | new (props: any) => ElementClass;    export interface IntrinsicAttributes extends /*...*/ {}    export type Element = /*...*/;    export type ElementClass = /*...*/;}
```



## Embedding Expressions

JSX allows you to embed expressions between tags by surrounding the expressions with curly braces (`{ }`).



```id
tsxconst a = (  <div>    {["foo", "bar"].map((i) => (      <span>{i / 2}</span>    ))}  </div>);
```



The above code will result in an error since you cannot divide a string by a number.
The output, when using the `preserve` option, looks like:



```id
tsxconst a = (  <div>    {["foo", "bar"].map(function (i) {      return <span>{i / 2}</span>;    })}  </div>);
```



## React integration

To use JSX with React you should use the React typings .
These typings define the `JSX` namespace appropriately for use with React.



```id
tsx/// <reference path="react.d.ts" />interface Props {  foo: string;}class MyComponent extends React.Component<Props, {}> {  render() {    return <span>{this.props.foo}</span>;  }}<MyComponent foo="bar" />; // ok<MyComponent foo={0} />; // error
```



### Configuring JSX

There are multiple compiler flags which can be used to customize your JSX, which work as both a compiler flag and via inline per-file pragmas. To learn more see their tsconfig reference pages:

- `jsxFactory` 

- `jsxFragmentFactory` 

- `jsxImportSource`

TypeScript: Documentation - Variable Declaration 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Variable Declaration

 

`let` and `const` are two relatively new concepts for variable declarations in JavaScript.
 As we mentioned earlier , `let` is similar to `var` in some respects, but allows users to avoid some of the common “gotchas” that users run into in JavaScript.

`const` is an augmentation of `let` in that it prevents re-assignment to a variable.

With TypeScript being an extension of JavaScript, the language naturally supports `let` and `const`.
Here we’ll elaborate more on these new declarations and why they’re preferable to `var`.

If you’ve used JavaScript offhandedly, the next section might be a good way to refresh your memory.
If you’re intimately familiar with all the quirks of `var` declarations in JavaScript, you might find it easier to skip ahead.

## `var` declarations

Declaring a variable in JavaScript has always traditionally been done with the `var` keyword.



```id
tsvar a = 10;
```



As you might’ve figured out, we just declared a variable named `a` with the value `10`.

We can also declare a variable inside of a function:



```id
tsfunction f() {  var message = "Hello, world!";  return message;}
```



and we can also access those same variables within other functions:



```id
tsfunction f() {  var a = 10;  return function g() {    var b = a + 1;    return b;  };}var g = f();g(); // returns '11'
```



In this above example, `g` captured the variable `a` declared in `f`.
At any point that `g` gets called, the value of `a` will be tied to the value of `a` in `f`.
Even if `g` is called once `f` is done running, it will be able to access and modify `a`.



```id
tsfunction f() {  var a = 1;  a = 2;  var b = g();  a = 3;  return b;  function g() {    return a;  }}f(); // returns '2'
```



### Scoping rules

`var` declarations have some odd scoping rules for those used to other languages.
Take the following example:



```id
tsfunction f(shouldInitialize: boolean) {  if (shouldInitialize) {    var x = 10;  }  return x;}f(true); // returns '10'f(false); // returns 'undefined'
```



Some readers might do a double-take at this example.
The variable `x` was declared within the `if` block , and yet we were able to access it from outside that block.
That’s because `var` declarations are accessible anywhere within their containing function, module, namespace, or global scope - all which we’ll go over later on - regardless of the containing block.
Some people call this `var`-scoping or function-scoping .
Parameters are also function scoped.

These scoping rules can cause several types of mistakes.
One problem they exacerbate is the fact that it is not an error to declare the same variable multiple times:



```id
tsfunction sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {  var sum = 0;  for (var i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {    var currentRow = matrix[i];    for (var i = 0; i < currentRow.length; i++) {      sum += currentRow[i];    }  }  return sum;}
```



Maybe it was easy to spot out for some experienced JavaScript developers, but the inner `for`-loop will accidentally overwrite the variable `i` because `i` refers to the same function-scoped variable.
As experienced developers know by now, similar sorts of bugs slip through code reviews and can be an endless source of frustration.

### Variable capturing quirks

Take a quick second to guess what the output of the following snippet is:



```id
tsfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  setTimeout(function () {    console.log(i);  }, 100 * i);}
```



For those unfamiliar, `setTimeout` will try to execute a function after a certain number of milliseconds (though waiting for anything else to stop running).

Ready? Take a look:



```
10101010101010101010
```



Many JavaScript developers are intimately familiar with this behavior, but if you’re surprised, you’re certainly not alone.
Most people expect the output to be



```
0123456789
```



Remember what we mentioned earlier about variable capturing?
Every function expression we pass to `setTimeout` actually refers to the same `i` from the same scope.

Let’s take a minute to consider what that means.
`setTimeout` will run a function after some number of milliseconds, but only after the `for` loop has stopped executing;
By the time the `for` loop has stopped executing, the value of `i` is `10`.
So each time the given function gets called, it will print out `10`!

A common work around is to use an IIFE - an Immediately Invoked Function Expression - to capture `i` at each iteration:



```id
tsfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  // capture the current state of 'i'  // by invoking a function with its current value  (function (i) {    setTimeout(function () {      console.log(i);    }, 100 * i);  })(i);}
```



This odd-looking pattern is actually pretty common.
The `i` in the parameter list actually shadows the `i` declared in the `for` loop, but since we named them the same, we didn’t have to modify the loop body too much.

## `let` declarations

By now you’ve figured out that `var` has some problems, which is precisely why `let` statements were introduced.
Apart from the keyword used, `let` statements are written the same way `var` statements are.



```id
tslet hello = "Hello!";
```



The key difference is not in the syntax, but in the semantics, which we’ll now dive into.

### Block-scoping

When a variable is declared using `let`, it uses what some call lexical-scoping or block-scoping .
Unlike variables declared with `var` whose scopes leak out to their containing function, block-scoped variables are not visible outside of their nearest containing block or `for`-loop.



```id
tsfunction f(input: boolean) {  let a = 100;  if (input) {    // Still okay to reference 'a'    let b = a + 1;    return b;  }  // Error: 'b' doesn't exist here  return b;}
```



Here, we have two local variables `a` and `b`.
`a`’s scope is limited to the body of `f` while `b`’s scope is limited to the containing `if` statement’s block.

Variables declared in a `catch` clause also have similar scoping rules.



```id
tstry {  throw "oh no!";} catch (e) {  console.log("Oh well.");}// Error: 'e' doesn't exist hereconsole.log(e);
```



Another property of block-scoped variables is that they can’t be read or written to before they’re actually declared.
While these variables are “present” throughout their scope, all points up until their declaration are part of their temporal dead zone .
This is just a sophisticated way of saying you can’t access them before the `let` statement, and luckily TypeScript will let you know that.



```id
tsa++; // illegal to use 'a' before it's declared;let a;
```



Something to note is that you can still capture a block-scoped variable before it’s declared.
The only catch is that it’s illegal to call that function before the declaration.
If targeting ES2015, a modern runtime will throw an error; however, right now TypeScript is permissive and won’t report this as an error.



```id
tsfunction foo() {  // okay to capture 'a'  return a;}// illegal call 'foo' before 'a' is declared// runtimes should throw an error herefoo();let a;
```



For more information on temporal dead zones, see relevant content on the Mozilla Developer Network .

### Re-declarations and Shadowing

With `var` declarations, we mentioned that it didn’t matter how many times you declared your variables; you just got one.



```id
tsfunction f(x) {  var x;  var x;  if (true) {    var x;  }}
```



In the above example, all declarations of `x` actually refer to the same `x`, and this is perfectly valid.
This often ends up being a source of bugs.
Thankfully, `let` declarations are not as forgiving.



```id
tslet x = 10;let x = 20; // error: can't re-declare 'x' in the same scope
```



The variables don’t necessarily need to both be block-scoped for TypeScript to tell us that there’s a problem.



```id
tsfunction f(x) {  let x = 100; // error: interferes with parameter declaration}function g() {  let x = 100;  var x = 100; // error: can't have both declarations of 'x'}
```



That’s not to say that a block-scoped variable can never be declared with a function-scoped variable.
The block-scoped variable just needs to be declared within a distinctly different block.



```id
tsfunction f(condition, x) {  if (condition) {    let x = 100;    return x;  }  return x;}f(false, 0); // returns '0'f(true, 0); // returns '100'
```



The act of introducing a new name in a more nested scope is called shadowing .
It is a bit of a double-edged sword in that it can introduce certain bugs on its own in the event of accidental shadowing, while also preventing certain bugs.
For instance, imagine we had written our earlier `sumMatrix` function using `let` variables.



```id
tsfunction sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {  let sum = 0;  for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {    var currentRow = matrix[i];    for (let i = 0; i < currentRow.length; i++) {      sum += currentRow[i];    }  }  return sum;}
```



This version of the loop will actually perform the summation correctly because the inner loop’s `i` shadows `i` from the outer loop.

Shadowing should usually be avoided in the interest of writing clearer code.
While there are some scenarios where it may be fitting to take advantage of it, you should use your best judgement.

### Block-scoped variable capturing

When we first touched on the idea of variable capturing with `var` declaration, we briefly went into how variables act once captured.
To give a better intuition of this, each time a scope is run, it creates an “environment” of variables.
That environment and its captured variables can exist even after everything within its scope has finished executing.



```id
tsfunction theCityThatAlwaysSleeps() {  let getCity;  if (true) {    let city = "Seattle";    getCity = function () {      return city;    };  }  return getCity();}
```



Because we’ve captured `city` from within its environment, we’re still able to access it despite the fact that the `if` block finished executing.

Recall that with our earlier `setTimeout` example, we ended up needing to use an IIFE to capture the state of a variable for every iteration of the `for` loop.
In effect, what we were doing was creating a new variable environment for our captured variables.
That was a bit of a pain, but luckily, you’ll never have to do that again in TypeScript.

`let` declarations have drastically different behavior when declared as part of a loop.
Rather than just introducing a new environment to the loop itself, these declarations sort of create a new scope per iteration .
Since this is what we were doing anyway with our IIFE, we can change our old `setTimeout` example to just use a `let` declaration.



```id
tsfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  setTimeout(function () {    console.log(i);  }, 100 * i);}
```



and as expected, this will print out



```
0123456789
```



## `const` declarations

`const` declarations are another way of declaring variables.



```id
tsconst numLivesForCat = 9;
```



They are like `let` declarations but, as their name implies, their value cannot be changed once they are bound.
In other words, they have the same scoping rules as `let`, but you can’t re-assign to them.

This should not be confused with the idea that the values they refer to are immutable .



```id
tsconst numLivesForCat = 9;const kitty = {  name: "Aurora",  numLives: numLivesForCat,};// Errorkitty = {  name: "Danielle",  numLives: numLivesForCat,};// all "okay"kitty.name = "Rory";kitty.name = "Kitty";kitty.name = "Cat";kitty.numLives--;
```



Unless you take specific measures to avoid it, the internal state of a `const` variable is still modifiable.
Fortunately, TypeScript allows you to specify that members of an object are `readonly`.
The chapter on Interfaces has the details.

## `let` vs. `const`

Given that we have two types of declarations with similar scoping semantics, it’s natural to find ourselves asking which one to use.
Like most broad questions, the answer is: it depends.

Applying the principle of least privilege , all declarations other than those you plan to modify should use `const`.
The rationale is that if a variable didn’t need to get written to, others working on the same codebase shouldn’t automatically be able to write to the object, and will need to consider whether they really need to reassign to the variable.
Using `const` also makes code more predictable when reasoning about flow of data.

Use your best judgement, and if applicable, consult the matter with the rest of your team.

The majority of this handbook uses `let` declarations.

## Destructuring

Another ECMAScript 2015 feature that TypeScript has is destructuring.
For a complete reference, see the article on the Mozilla Developer Network .
In this section, we’ll give a short overview.

### Array destructuring

The simplest form of destructuring is array destructuring assignment:



```id
tslet input = [1, 2];let [first, second] = input;console.log(first); // outputs 1console.log(second); // outputs 2
```



This creates two new variables named `first` and `second`.
This is equivalent to using indexing, but is much more convenient:



```id
tsfirst = input[0];second = input[1];
```



Destructuring works with already-declared variables as well:



```id
ts// swap variables[first, second] = [second, first];
```



And with parameters to a function:



```id
tsfunction f([first, second]: [number, number]) {  console.log(first);  console.log(second);}f([1, 2]);
```



You can create a variable for the remaining items in a list using the syntax `...`:



```id
tslet [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];console.log(first); // outputs 1console.log(rest); // outputs [ 2, 3, 4 ]
```



Of course, since this is JavaScript, you can just ignore trailing elements you don’t care about:



```id
tslet [first] = [1, 2, 3, 4];console.log(first); // outputs 1
```



Or other elements:



```id
tslet [, second, , fourth] = [1, 2, 3, 4];console.log(second); // outputs 2console.log(fourth); // outputs 4
```



### Tuple destructuring

Tuples may be destructured like arrays; the destructuring variables get the types of the corresponding tuple elements:



```id
tslet tuple: [number, string, boolean] = [7, "hello", true];let [a, b, c] = tuple; // a: number, b: string, c: boolean
```



It’s an error to destructure a tuple beyond the range of its elements:



```id
tslet [a, b, c, d] = tuple; // Error, no element at index 3
```



As with arrays, you can destructure the rest of the tuple with `...`, to get a shorter tuple:



```id
tslet [a, ...bc] = tuple; // bc: [string, boolean]let [a, b, c, ...d] = tuple; // d: [], the empty tuple
```



Or ignore trailing elements, or other elements:



```id
tslet [a] = tuple; // a: numberlet [, b] = tuple; // b: string
```



### Object destructuring

You can also destructure objects:



```id
tslet o = {  a: "foo",  b: 12,  c: "bar",};let { a, b } = o;
```



This creates new variables `a` and `b` from `o.a` and `o.b`.
Notice that you can skip `c` if you don’t need it.

Like array destructuring, you can have assignment without declaration:



```id
ts({ a, b } = { a: "baz", b: 101 });
```



Notice that we had to surround this statement with parentheses.
JavaScript normally parses a `{` as the start of block.

You can create a variable for the remaining items in an object using the syntax `...`:



```id
tslet { a, ...passthrough } = o;let total = passthrough.b + passthrough.c.length;
```



#### Property renaming

You can also give different names to properties:



```id
tslet { a: newName1, b: newName2 } = o;
```



Here the syntax starts to get confusing.
You can read `a: newName1` as ”`a` as `newName1`”.
The direction is left-to-right, as if you had written:



```id
tslet newName1 = o.a;let newName2 = o.b;
```



Confusingly, the colon here does not indicate the type.
The type, if you specify it, still needs to be written after the entire destructuring:



```id
tslet { a: newName1, b: newName2 }: { a: string; b: number } = o;
```



#### Default values

Default values let you specify a default value in case a property is undefined:



```id
tsfunction keepWholeObject(wholeObject: { a: string; b?: number }) {  let { a, b = 1001 } = wholeObject;}
```



In this example the `b?` indicates that `b` is optional, so it may be `undefined`.
`keepWholeObject` now has a variable for `wholeObject` as well as the properties `a` and `b`, even if `b` is undefined.

## Function declarations

Destructuring also works in function declarations.
For simple cases this is straightforward:



```id
tstype C = { a: string; b?: number };function f({ a, b }: C): void {  // ...}
```



But specifying defaults is more common for parameters, and getting defaults right with destructuring can be tricky.
First of all, you need to remember to put the pattern before the default value.



```id
tsfunction f({ a = "", b = 0 } = {}): void {  // ...}f();
```


 

The snippet above is an example of type inference, explained earlier in the handbook.

 

Then, you need to remember to give a default for optional properties on the destructured property instead of the main initializer.
Remember that `C` was defined with `b` optional:



```id
tsfunction f({ a, b = 0 } = { a: "" }): void {  // ...}f({ a: "yes" }); // ok, default b = 0f(); // ok, default to { a: "" }, which then defaults b = 0f({}); // error, 'a' is required if you supply an argument
```



Use destructuring with care.
As the previous example demonstrates, anything but the simplest destructuring expression is confusing.
This is especially true with deeply nested destructuring, which gets really hard to understand even without piling on renaming, default values, and type annotations.
Try to keep destructuring expressions small and simple.
You can always write the assignments that destructuring would generate yourself.

## Spread

The spread operator is the opposite of destructuring.
It allows you to spread an array into another array, or an object into another object.
For example:



```id
tslet first = [1, 2];let second = [3, 4];let bothPlus = [0, ...first, ...second, 5];
```



This gives bothPlus the value `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
Spreading creates a shallow copy of `first` and `second`.
They are not changed by the spread.

You can also spread objects:



```id
tslet defaults = { food: "spicy", price: "$", ambiance: "noisy" };let search = { ...defaults, food: "rich" };
```



Now `search` is `{ food: "rich", price: "$$", ambiance: "noisy" }`.
Object spreading is more complex than array spreading.
Like array spreading, it proceeds from left-to-right, but the result is still an object.
This means that properties that come later in the spread object overwrite properties that come earlier.
So if we modify the previous example to spread at the end:



```id
tslet defaults = { food: "spicy", price: "$", ambiance: "noisy" };let search = { food: "rich", ...defaults };
```



Then the `food` property in `defaults` overwrites `food: "rich"`, which is not what we want in this case.

Object spread also has a couple of other surprising limits.
First, it only includes an objects’
 own, enumerable properties .
Basically, that means you lose methods when you spread instances of an object:



```id
tsclass C {  p = 12;  m() {}}let c = new C();let clone = { ...c };clone.p; // okclone.m(); // error!
```



Second, the TypeScript compiler doesn’t allow spreads of type parameters from generic functions.
That feature is expected in future versions of the language.

## `using` declarations

`using` declarations are an upcoming feature for JavaScript that are part of the
 Stage 3 Explicit Resource Management proposal. A
`using` declaration is much like a `const` declaration, except that it couples the lifetime of the value bound to the
declaration with the scope of the variable.

When control exits the block containing a `using` declaration, the `[Symbol.dispose]()` method of the
declared value is executed, which allows that value to perform cleanup:



```id
tsfunction f() {  using x = new C();  doSomethingWith(x);} // `x[Symbol.dispose]()` is called
```



At runtime, this has an effect roughly equivalent to the following:



```id
tsfunction f() {  const x = new C();  try {    doSomethingWith(x);  }  finally {    x[Symbol.dispose]();  }}
```



`using` declarations are extremely useful for avoiding memory leaks when working with JavaScript objects that hold on to
native references like file handles



```id
ts{  using file = await openFile();  file.write(text);  doSomethingThatMayThrow();} // `file` is disposed, even if an error is thrown
```



or scoped operations like tracing



```id
tsfunction f() {  using activity = new TraceActivity("f"); // traces entry into function  // ...} // traces exit of function
```



Unlike `var`, `let`, and `const`, `using` declarations do not support destructuring.

### `null` and `undefined`

It’s important to note that the value can be `null` or `undefined`, in which case nothing is disposed at the end of the
block:



```id
ts{  using x = b ? new C() : null;  // ...}
```



which is roughly equivalent to:



```id
ts{  const x = b ? new C() : null;  try {    // ...  }  finally {    x?.[Symbol.dispose]();  }}
```



This allows you to conditionally acquire resources when declaring a `using` declaration without the need for complex
branching or repetition.

### Defining a disposable resource

You can indicate the classes or objects you produce are disposable by implementing the `Disposable` interface:



```id
ts// from the default lib:interface Disposable {  [Symbol.dispose](): void;}// usage:class TraceActivity implements Disposable {  readonly name: string;  constructor(name: string) {    this.name = name;    console.log(`Entering: ${name}`);  }  [Symbol.dispose](): void {    console.log(`Exiting: ${name}`);  }}function f() {  using _activity = new TraceActivity("f");  console.log("Hello world!");}f();// prints://   Entering: f//   Hello world!//   Exiting: f
```



## `await using` declarations

Some resources or operations may have cleanup that needs to be performed asynchronously. To accommodate this, the
 Explicit Resource Management proposal also introduces
the `await using` declaration:



```id
tsasync function f() {  await using x = new C();} // `await x[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` is invoked
```



An `await using` declaration invokes, and awaits , its value’s `[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` method as control leaves the
containing block. This allows for asynchronous cleanup, such as a database transaction performing a rollback or commit,
or a file stream flushing any pending writes to storage before it is closed.

As with `await`, `await using` can only be used in an `async` function or method, or at the top level of a module.

### Defining an asynchronously disposable resource

Just as `using` relies on objects that are `Disposable`, an `await using` relies on objects that are `AsyncDisposable`:



```id
ts// from the default lib:interface AsyncDisposable {  [Symbol.asyncDispose]: PromiseLike<void>;}// usage:class DatabaseTransaction implements AsyncDisposable {  public success = false;  private db: Database | undefined;  private constructor(db: Database) {    this.db = db;  }  static async create(db: Database) {    await db.execAsync("BEGIN TRANSACTION");    return new DatabaseTransaction(db);  }  async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {    if (this.db) {      const db = this.db:      this.db = undefined;      if (this.success) {        await db.execAsync("COMMIT TRANSACTION");      }      else {        await db.execAsync("ROLLBACK TRANSACTION");      }    }  }}async function transfer(db: Database, account1: Account, account2: Account, amount: number) {  using tx = await DatabaseTransaction.create(db);  if (await debitAccount(db, account1, amount)) {    await creditAccount(db, account2, amount);  }  // if an exception is thrown before this line, the transaction will roll back  tx.success = true;  // now the transaction will commit}
```



### `await using` vs `await`

The `await` keyword that is part of the `await using` declaration only indicates that the disposal of the resource is
`await`-ed. It does not `await` the value itself:



```id
ts{  await using x = getResourceSynchronously();} // performs `await x[Symbol.asyncDispose]()`{  await using y = await getResourceAsynchronously();} // performs `await y[Symbol.asyncDispose]()`
```



### `await using` and `return`

It’s important to note that there is a small caveat with this behavior if you are using an `await using` declaration in
an `async` function that returns a `Promise` without first `await`-ing it:



```id
tsfunction g() {  return Promise.reject("error!");}async function f() {  await using x = new C();  return g(); // missing an `await`}
```



Because the returned promise isn’t `await`-ed, it’s possible that the JavaScript runtime may report an unhandled
rejection since execution pauses while `await`-ing the asynchronous disposal of `x`, without having subscribed to the
returned promise. This is not a problem that is unique to `await using`, however, as this can also occur in an `async`
function that uses `try..finally`:



```id
tsasync function f() {  try {    return g(); // also reports an unhandled rejection  }  finally {    await somethingElse();  }}
```



To avoid this situation, it is recommended that you `await` your return value if it may be a `Promise`:



```id
tsasync function f() {  await using x = new C();  return await g();}
```



## `using` and `await using` in `for` and `for..of` statements

Both `using` and `await using` can be used in a `for` statement:



```id
tsfor (using x = getReader(); !x.eof; x.next()) {  // ...}
```



In this case, the lifetime of `x` is scoped to the entire `for` statement and is only disposed when control leaves the
loop due to `break`, `return`, `throw`, or when the loop condition is false.

In addition to `for` statements, both declarations can also be used in `for..of` statements:



```id
tsfunction * g() {  yield createResource1();  yield createResource2();}for (using x of g()) {  // ...}
```



Here, `x` is disposed at the end of each iteration of the loop , and is then reinitialized with the next value. This is
especially useful when consuming resources produced one at a time by a generator.

## `using` and `await using` in older runtimes

`using` and `await using` declarations can be used when targeting older ECMAScript editions as long as you are using
a compatible polyfill for `Symbol.dispose`/`Symbol.asyncDispose`, such as the one provided by default in recent
editions of NodeJS.

# Mixins

 

Along with traditional OO hierarchies, another popular way of building up classes from reusable components is to build them by combining simpler partial classes.
You may be familiar with the idea of mixins or traits for languages like Scala, and the pattern has also reached some popularity in the JavaScript community.

## How Does A Mixin Work?

The pattern relies on using generics with class inheritance to extend a base class.
TypeScript’s best mixin support is done via the class expression pattern.
You can read more about how this pattern works in JavaScript here .

To get started, we’ll need a class which will have the mixins applied on top of:



```id
tsclass Sprite {  name = "";  x = 0;  y = 0;   constructor(name: string) {    this.name = name;  }}Try
```



Then you need a type and a factory function which returns a class expression extending the base class.



```id
ts// To get started, we need a type which we&apos;ll use to extend// other classes from. The main responsibility is to declare// that the type being passed in is a class. type  {}' >Constructor = new (...args: any[]) => {}; // This mixin adds a scale property, with getters and setters// for changing it with an encapsulated private property: function (Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & TBase' >Scale<(Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & TBase' >TBase extends  {}' >Constructor>(Base: (Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & TBase' >TBase) {  return class Scaling extends Base {    // Mixins may not declare private/protected properties    // however, you can use ES2020 private fields    _scale = 1;     setScale(scale: number) {      this._scale = scale;    }     get scale(): number {      return this._scale;    }  };}Try
```



With these all set up, then you can create a class which represents the base class with mixins applied:



```id
ts// Compose a new class from the Sprite class,// with the Mixin Scale applier:const .Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & typeof Sprite' >EightBitSprite = (Base: typeof Sprite): {
    new (...args: any[]): Scale<typeof Sprite>.Scaling;
    prototype: Scale<any>.Scaling;
} & typeof Sprite' >Scale(Sprite); const .Scaling & Sprite' >flappySprite = new  Scale<typeof Sprite>.Scaling & Sprite' >EightBitSprite("Bird");.Scaling & Sprite' >flappySprite..setScale(scale: number): void' >setScale(0.8);console.log(.Scaling & Sprite' >flappySprite..scale: number' >scale);Try
```



## Constrained Mixins

In the above form, the mixin’s have no underlying knowledge of the class which can make it hard to create the design you want.

To model this, we modify the original constructor type to accept a generic argument.



```id
ts// This was our previous constructor:type  {}' >Constructor = new (...args: any[]) => {};// Now we use a generic version which can apply a constraint on// the class which this mixin is applied totype  = new (...args: any[]) => T' >GConstructor<' >T = {}> = new (...args: any[]) => ' >T;Try
```



This allows for creating classes which only work with constrained base classes:



```id
tstype  {
    setPos: (x: number, y: number) => void;
}' >Positionable =  = new (...args: any[]) => T' >GConstructor<{  void' >setPos: (x: number, y: number) => void }>;type  Sprite' >Spritable =  = new (...args: any[]) => T' >GConstructor<Sprite>;type  {
    print: () => void;
}' >Loggable =  = new (...args: any[]) => T' >GConstructor<{  void' >print: () => void }>;Try
```



Then you can create mixins which only work when you have a particular base to build on:



```id
tsfunction (Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Jumpable;
    prototype: Jumpable<any>.Jumpable;
} & TBase' >Jumpable<(Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Jumpable;
    prototype: Jumpable<any>.Jumpable;
} & TBase' >TBase extends  {
    setPos: (x: number, y: number) => void;
}' >Positionable>(Base: (Base: TBase): {
    new (...args: any[]): Jumpable;
    prototype: Jumpable<any>.Jumpable;
} & TBase' >TBase) {  return class Jumpable extends Base {    jump() {      // This mixin will only work if it is passed a base      // class which has setPos defined because of the      // Positionable constraint.      this. void' >setPos(0, 20);    }  };}Try
```



## Alternative Pattern

Previous versions of this document recommended a way to write mixins where you created both the runtime and type hierarchies separately, then merged them at the end:



```id
ts// Each mixin is a traditional ES classclass Jumpable {  jump() {}} class Duckable {  duck() {}} // Including the baseclass Sprite {  x = 0;  y = 0;} // Then you create an interface which merges// the expected mixins with the same name as your baseinterface Sprite extends Jumpable, Duckable {}// Apply the mixins into the base class via// the JS at runtimeapplyMixins(Sprite, [Jumpable, Duckable]); let player = new Sprite();player.jump();console.log(player.x, player.y); // This can live anywhere in your codebase:function applyMixins(derivedCtor: any, constructors: any[]) {  constructors..forEach(callbackfn: (value: any, index: number, array: any[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((baseCtor) => {    Object.getOwnPropertyNames(baseCtor.prototype)..forEach(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((name) => {      Object.(o: any, p: PropertyKey, attributes: PropertyDescriptor & ThisType<any>): any' >defineProperty(        derivedCtor.prototype,        name,        Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(baseCtor.prototype, name) ||          Object.create(null)      );    });  });}Try
```



This pattern relies less on the compiler, and more on your codebase to ensure both runtime and type-system are correctly kept in sync.

## Constraints

The mixin pattern is supported natively inside the TypeScript compiler by code flow analysis.
There are a few cases where you can hit the edges of the native support.

#### Decorators and Mixins `#4881` 

You cannot use decorators to provide mixins via code flow analysis:



```id
ts// A decorator function which replicates the mixin pattern:const  typeof Pausable' >Pausable = (target: typeof Player) => {  return class Pausable extends target {    shouldFreeze = false;  };}; @ typeof Pausable' >Pausableclass Player {  x = 0;  y = 0;} // The Player class does not have the decorator&apos;s type merged:const player = new Player();player.shouldFreeze;Property 'shouldFreeze' does not exist on type 'Player'.2339Property 'shouldFreeze' does not exist on type 'Player'. // The runtime aspect could be manually replicated via// type composition or interface merging.type FreezablePlayer = Player & { shouldFreeze: boolean }; const playerTwo = (new Player() as unknown) as FreezablePlayer;playerTwo.shouldFreeze;Try
```



#### Static Property Mixins `#17829` 

More of a gotcha than a constraint.
The class expression pattern creates singletons, so they can’t be mapped at the type system to support different variable types.

You can work around this by using functions to return your classes which differ based on a generic:



```id
tsfunction (): typeof Base' >base<(): typeof Base' >T>() {  class Base {    static prop: (): typeof Base' >T;  }  return Base;} function (): typeof Derived' >derived<(): typeof Derived' >T>() {  class Derived extends (): typeof Base' >base<(): typeof Derived' >T>() {    static anotherProp: (): typeof Derived' >T;  }  return Derived;} class Spec extends (): typeof Derived' >derived<string>() {} Spec..prop: string' >prop; // stringSpec..anotherProp: string' >anotherProp; // stringTry
```

# Modules - Introduction

 

This document is divided into four sections:

 The first section develops the theory behind how TypeScript approaches modules. If you want to be able to write the correct module-related compiler options for any situation, reason about how to integrate TypeScript with other tools, or understand how TypeScript processes dependency packages, this is the place to start. While there are guides and reference pages on these topics, building an understanding of these fundamentals will make reading the guides easier, and give you a mental framework for dealing with real-world problems not specifically covered here.

- The guides show how to accomplish specific real-world tasks, starting with picking the right compilation settings for a new project. The guides are a good place to start both for beginners who want to get up and running as quickly as possible and for experts who already have a good grasp of the theory but want concrete guidance on a complicated task.

- The reference section provides a more detailed look at the syntaxes and configurations presented in previous sections.

- The appendices cover complicated topics that deserve additional explanation in more detail than the theory or reference sections allow.

TypeScript: Documentation - Namespaces

# Namespaces

 

 A note about terminology: 
It’s important to note that in TypeScript 1.5, the nomenclature has changed.
“Internal modules” are now “namespaces”.
“External modules” are now simply “modules”, as to align with ECMAScript 2015 ’s terminology, (namely that `module X {` is equivalent to the now-preferred `namespace X {`).

 

This post outlines the various ways to organize your code using namespaces (previously “internal modules”) in TypeScript.
As we alluded in our note about terminology, “internal modules” are now referred to as “namespaces”.
Additionally, anywhere the `module` keyword was used when declaring an internal module, the `namespace` keyword can and should be used instead.
This avoids confusing new users by overloading them with similarly named terms.

## First steps

Let’s start with the program we’ll be using as our example throughout this page.
We’ve written a small set of simplistic string validators, as you might write to check a user’s input on a form in a webpage or check the format of an externally-provided data file.

## Validators in a single file



```id
tsinterface StringValidator {  isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;}let lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;let numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {  isAcceptable(s: string) {    return lettersRegexp.test(s);  }}class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {  isAcceptable(s: string) {    return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);  }}// Some samples to trylet strings = ["Hello", "98052", "101"];// Validators to uselet validators: { [s: string]: StringValidator } = {};validators["ZIP code"] = new ZipCodeValidator();validators["Letters only"] = new LettersOnlyValidator();// Show whether each string passed each validatorfor (let s of strings) {  for (let name in validators) {    let isMatch = validators[name].isAcceptable(s);    console.log(`'${s}' ${isMatch ? "matches" : "does not match"} '${name}'.`);  }}
```



## Namespacing

As we add more validators, we’re going to want to have some kind of organization scheme so that we can keep track of our types and not worry about name collisions with other objects.
Instead of putting lots of different names into the global namespace, let’s wrap up our objects into a namespace.

In this example, we’ll move all validator-related entities into a namespace called `Validation`.
Because we want the interfaces and classes here to be visible outside the namespace, we preface them with `export`.
Conversely, the variables `lettersRegexp` and `numberRegexp` are implementation details, so they are left unexported and will not be visible to code outside the namespace.
In the test code at the bottom of the file, we now need to qualify the names of the types when used outside the namespace, e.g. `Validation.LettersOnlyValidator`.

## Namespaced Validators



```id
tsnamespace Validation {  export interface StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;  }  const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;  const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;  export class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string) {      return lettersRegexp.test(s);    }  }  export class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string) {      return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);    }  }}// Some samples to trylet strings = ["Hello", "98052", "101"];// Validators to uselet validators: { [s: string]: Validation.StringValidator } = {};validators["ZIP code"] = new Validation.ZipCodeValidator();validators["Letters only"] = new Validation.LettersOnlyValidator();// Show whether each string passed each validatorfor (let s of strings) {  for (let name in validators) {    console.log(      `"${s}" - ${        validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? "matches" : "does not match"      } ${name}`    );  }}
```



## Splitting Across Files

As our application grows, we’ll want to split the code across multiple files to make it easier to maintain.

## Multi-file namespaces

Here, we’ll split our `Validation` namespace across many files.
Even though the files are separate, they can each contribute to the same namespace and can be consumed as if they were all defined in one place.
Because there are dependencies between files, we’ll add reference tags to tell the compiler about the relationships between the files.
Our test code is otherwise unchanged.

 Validation.ts 


```id
tsnamespace Validation {  export interface StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;  }}
```


 LettersOnlyValidator.ts 


```id
ts/// <reference path="Validation.ts" />namespace Validation {  const lettersRegexp = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;  export class LettersOnlyValidator implements StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string) {      return lettersRegexp.test(s);    }  }}
```


 ZipCodeValidator.ts 


```id
ts/// <reference path="Validation.ts" />namespace Validation {  const numberRegexp = /^[0-9]+$/;  export class ZipCodeValidator implements StringValidator {    isAcceptable(s: string) {      return s.length === 5 && numberRegexp.test(s);    }  }}
```


 Test.ts 


```id
ts/// <reference path="Validation.ts" />/// <reference path="LettersOnlyValidator.ts" />/// <reference path="ZipCodeValidator.ts" />// Some samples to trylet strings = ["Hello", "98052", "101"];// Validators to uselet validators: { [s: string]: Validation.StringValidator } = {};validators["ZIP code"] = new Validation.ZipCodeValidator();validators["Letters only"] = new Validation.LettersOnlyValidator();// Show whether each string passed each validatorfor (let s of strings) {  for (let name in validators) {    console.log(      `"${s}" - ${        validators[name].isAcceptable(s) ? "matches" : "does not match"      } ${name}`    );  }}
```



Once there are multiple files involved, we’ll need to make sure all of the compiled code gets loaded.
There are two ways of doing this.

First, we can use concatenated output using the `outFile` option to compile all of the input files into a single JavaScript output file:



```
tsc --outFile sample.js Test.ts
```

 

The compiler will automatically order the output file based on the reference tags present in the files. You can also specify each file individually:



```
tsc --outFile sample.js Validation.ts LettersOnlyValidator.ts ZipCodeValidator.ts Test.ts
```

 
 Alternatively, we can use per-file compilation (the default) to emit one JavaScript file for each input file.
If multiple JS files get produced, we’ll need to use `

# Modules - Theory

 

## Scripts and modules in JavaScript

In the early days of JavaScript, when the language only ran in browsers, there were no modules, but it was still possible to split the JavaScript for a web page into multiple files by using multiple `script` tags in HTML:



```id
html<html>  <head>    <script src="a.js"></script>    <script src="b.js"></script>  </head>  <body></body></html>
```



This approach had some downsides, especially as web pages grew larger and more complex. In particular, all scripts loaded onto the same page share the same scope—appropriately called the “global scope”—meaning the scripts had to be very careful not to overwrite each others’ variables and functions.

Any system that solves this problem by giving files their own scope while still providing a way to make bits of code available to other files can be called a “module system.” (It may sound obvious to say that each file in a module system is called a “module,” but the term is often used to contrast with script files, which run outside a module system, in a global scope.)

 

There are many module systems , and TypeScript supports emitting several , but this documentation will focus on the two most important systems today: ECMAScript modules (ESM) and CommonJS (CJS).

ECMAScript Modules (ESM) is the module system built into the language, supported in modern browsers and in Node.js since v12. It uses dedicated `import` and `export` syntax:



```id
js// a.jsexport default "Hello from a.js";
```




```id
js// b.jsimport a from "./a.js";console.log(a); // 'Hello from a.js'
```



CommonJS (CJS) is the module system that originally shipped in Node.js, before ESM was part of the language specification. It’s still supported in Node.js alongside ESM. It uses plain JavaScript objects and functions named `exports` and `require`:



```id
js// a.jsexports.message = "Hello from a.js";
```




```id
js// b.jsconst a = require("./a");console.log(a.message); // 'Hello from a.js'
```


 

Accordingly, when TypeScript detects that a file is a CommonJS or ECMAScript module, it starts by assuming that file will have its own scope. Beyond that, though, the compiler’s job gets a little more complicated.

## TypeScript’s job concerning modules

The TypeScript compiler’s chief goal is to prevent certain kinds of runtime errors by catching them at compile time. With or without modules involved, the compiler needs to know about the code’s intended runtime environment—what globals are available, for example. When modules are involved, there are several additional questions the compiler needs to answer in order to do its job. Let’s use a few lines of input code as an example to think about all the information needed to analyze it:



```id
tsimport sayHello from "greetings";sayHello("world");
```



To check this file, the compiler needs to know the type of `sayHello` (is it a function that can accept one string argument?), which opens quite a few additional questions:

 Will the module system load this TypeScript file directly, or will it load a JavaScript file that I (or another compiler) generate from this TypeScript file?

- What kind of module does the module system expect to find, given the file name it will load and its location on disk?

- If output JavaScript is being emitted, how will the module syntax present in this file be transformed in the output code?

- Where will the module system look to find the module specified by `"greetings"`? Will the lookup succeed?

- What kind of module is the file resolved by that lookup?

- Does the module system allow the kind of module detected in (2) to reference the kind of module detected in (5) with the syntax decided in (3)?

- Once the `"greetings"` module has been analyzed, what piece of that module is bound to `sayHello`?

Notice that all of these questions depend on characteristics of the host —the system that ultimately consumes the output JavaScript (or raw TypeScript, as the case may be) to direct its module loading behavior, typically either a runtime (like Node.js) or bundler (like Webpack).

The ECMAScript specification defines how ESM imports and exports link up with each other, but it doesn’t specify how the file lookup in (4), known as module resolution , happens, and it doesn’t say anything about other module systems like CommonJS. So runtimes and bundlers, especially those that want to support both ESM and CJS, have a lot of freedom to design their own rules. Consequently, the way TypeScript should answer the questions above can vary dramatically depending on where the code is intended to run. There’s no single right answer, so the compiler must be told the rules through configuration options.

The other key idea to keep in mind is that TypeScript almost always thinks about these questions in terms of its output JavaScript files, not its input TypeScript (or JavaScript!) files. Today, some runtimes and bundlers support loading TypeScript files directly, and in those cases, it doesn’t make sense to think about separate input and output files. Most of this document discusses cases where TypeScript files are compiled to JavaScript files, which in turn are loaded by the runtime module system. Examining these cases is essential for building an understanding of the compiler’s options and behavior—it’s easier to start there and simplify when thinking about esbuild, Bun, and other TypeScript-first runtimes and bundlers . So for now, we can summarize TypeScript’s job when it comes to modules in terms of output files:

Understand the rules of the host enough

- to compile files into a valid output module format ,

- to ensure that imports in those outputs will resolve successfully , and

- to know what type to assign to imported names .

## Who is the host?

Before we move on, it’s worth making sure we’re on the same page about the term host , because it will come up frequently. We defined it before as “the system that ultimately consumes the output code to direct its module loading behavior.” In other words, it’s the system outside of TypeScript that TypeScript’s module analysis tries to model:

- When the output code (whether produced by `tsc` or a third-party transpiler) is run directly in a runtime like Node.js, the runtime is the host.

- When there is no “output code” because a runtime consumes TypeScript files directly, the runtime is still the host.

- When a bundler consumes TypeScript inputs or outputs and produces a bundle, the bundler is the host, because it looked at the original set of imports/requires, looked up what files they referenced, and produced a new file or set of files where the original imports and requires are erased or transformed beyond recognition. (That bundle itself might comprise modules, and the runtime that runs it will be its host, but TypeScript doesn’t know about anything that happens post-bundler.)

- If another transpiler, optimizer, or formatter runs on TypeScript’s outputs, it’s not a host that TypeScript cares about, as long as it leaves the imports and exports it sees alone.

- When loading modules in a web browser, the behaviors TypeScript needs to model are actually split between the web server and the module system running in the browser. The browser’s JavaScript engine (or a script-based module-loading framework like RequireJS) controls what module formats are accepted, while the web server decides what file to send when one module triggers a request to load another.

- The TypeScript compiler itself is not a host, because it does not provide any behavior related to modules beyond trying to model other hosts.

## The module output format

In any project, the first question about modules we need to answer is what kinds of modules the host expects, so TypeScript can set its output format for each file to match. Sometimes, the host only supports one kind of module—ESM in the browser, or CJS in Node.js v11 and earlier, for example. Node.js v12 and later accepts both CJS and ES modules, but uses file extensions and `package.json` files to determine what format each file should be, and throws an error if the file’s contents don’t match the expected format.

The `module` compiler option provides this information to the compiler. Its primary purpose is to control the module format of any JavaScript that gets emitted during compilation, but it also serves to inform the compiler about how the module kind of each file should be detected, how different module kinds are allowed to import each other, and whether features like `import.meta` and top-level `await` are available. So, even if a TypeScript project is using `noEmit`, choosing the right setting for `module` still matters. As we established earlier, the compiler needs an accurate understanding of the module system so it can type check (and provide IntelliSense for) imports. See Choosing compiler options for guidance on choosing the right `module` setting for your project.

The available `module` settings are

- `node16` : Reflects the module system of Node.js v16+, which supports ES modules and CJS modules side-by-side with particular interoperability and detection rules.

- `node18` : Reflects the module system of Node.js v18+, which adds support for import attributes.

- `nodenext` : A moving target reflecting the latest Node.js versions as Node.js’s module system evolves. As of TypeScript 5.8, `nodenext` supports `require` of ECMAScript modules.

- `es2015` : Reflects the ES2015 language specification for JavaScript modules (the version that first introduced `import` and `export` to the language).

- `es2020` : Adds support for `import.meta` and `export * as ns from "mod"` to `es2015`.

- `es2022` : Adds support for top-level `await` to `es2020`.

- `esnext` : Currently identical to `es2022`, but will be a moving target reflecting the latest ECMAScript specifications, as well as module-related Stage 3+ proposals that are expected to be included in upcoming specification versions.

- `commonjs` , `system` , `amd` , and `umd` : Each emits everything in the module system named, and assumes everything can be successfully imported into that module system. These are no longer recommended for new projects and will not be covered in detail by this documentation.

 

Node.js’s rules for module format detection and interoperability make it incorrect to specify `module` as `esnext` or `commonjs` for projects that run in Node.js, even if all files emitted by `tsc` are ESM or CJS, respectively. The only correct `module` settings for projects that intend to run in Node.js are `node16` and `nodenext`. While the emitted JavaScript for an all-ESM Node.js project might look identical between compilations using `esnext` and `nodenext`, the type checking can differ. See the reference section on `nodenext` for more details.

 

### Module format detection

Node.js understands both ES modules and CJS modules, but the format of each file is determined by its file extension and the `type` field of the first `package.json` file found in a search of the file’s directory and all ancestor directories:

- `.mjs` and `.cjs` files are always interpreted as ES modules and CJS modules, respectively.

- `.js` files are interpreted as ES modules if the nearest `package.json` file contains a `type` field with the value `"module"`. If there is no `package.json` file, or if the `type` field is missing or has any other value, `.js` files are interpreted as CJS modules.

If a file is determined to be an ES module by these rules, Node.js will not inject the CommonJS `module` and `require` objects into the file’s scope during evaluation, so a file that tries to use them will cause a crash. Conversely, if a file is determined to be a CJS module, `import` and `export` declarations in the file will cause a syntax error crash.

When the `module` compiler option is set to `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext`, TypeScript applies this same algorithm to the project’s input files to determine the module kind of each corresponding output file. Let’s look at how module formats are detected in an example project that uses `--module nodenext`:

 
 
 
 Input file name 
 Contents 
 Output file name 
 Module kind 
 Reason 
 
 
 
 
 `/package.json` 
 `{}` 
 
 
 
 
 
 `/main.mts` 
 
 `/main.mjs` 
 ESM 
 File extension 
 
 
 `/utils.cts` 
 
 `/utils.cjs` 
 CJS 
 File extension 
 
 
 `/example.ts` 
 
 `/example.js` 
 CJS 
 No `"type": "module"` in `package.json` 
 
 
 `/node_modules/pkg/package.json` 
 `{ "type": "module" }` 
 
 
 
 
 
 `/node_modules/pkg/index.d.ts` 
 
 
 ESM 
 `"type": "module"` in `package.json` 
 
 
 `/node_modules/pkg/index.d.cts` 
 
 
 CJS 
 File extension 
 
 
 

When the input file extension is `.mts` or `.cts`, TypeScript knows to treat that file as an ES module or CJS module, respectively, because Node.js will treat the output `.mjs` file as an ES module or the output `.cjs` file as a CJS module. When the input file extension is `.ts`, TypeScript has to consult the nearest `package.json` file to determine the module format, because this is what Node.js will do when it encounters the output `.js` file. (Notice that the same rules apply to the `.d.cts` and `.d.ts` declaration files in the `pkg` dependency: though they will not produce an output file as part of this compilation, the presence of a `.d.ts` file implies the existence of a corresponding `.js` file—perhaps created when the author of the `pkg` library ran `tsc` on an input `.ts` file of their own—which Node.js must interpret as an ES module, due to its `.js` extension and the presence of the `"type": "module"` field in `/node_modules/pkg/package.json`. Declaration files are covered in more detail in a later section .)

The detected module format of input files is used by TypeScript to ensure it emits the output syntax that Node.js expects in each output file. If TypeScript were to emit `/example.js` with `import` and `export` statements in it, Node.js would crash when parsing the file. If TypeScript were to emit `/main.mjs` with `require` calls, Node.js would crash during evaluation. Beyond emit, the module format is also used to determine rules for type checking and module resolution, which we’ll discuss in the following sections.

As of TypeScript 5.6, other `--module` modes (like `esnext` and `commonjs`) also respect format-specific file extensions (`.mts` and `.cts`) as a file-level override for the emit format. For example, a file named `main.mts` will emit ESM syntax into `main.mjs` even if `--module` is set to `commonjs`.

It’s worth mentioning again that TypeScript’s behavior in `--module node16`, `--module node18`, and `--module nodenext` is entirely motivated by Node.js’s behavior. Since TypeScript’s goal is to catch potential runtime errors at compile time, it needs a very accurate model of what will happen at runtime. This fairly complex set of rules for module kind detection is necessary for checking code that will run in Node.js, but may be overly strict or just incorrect if applied to non-Node.js hosts.

### Input module syntax

It’s important to note that the input module syntax seen in input source files is somewhat decoupled from the output module syntax emitted to JS files. That is, a file with an ESM import:



```id
tsimport { sayHello } from "greetings";sayHello("world");
```



might be emitted in ESM format exactly as-is, or might be emitted as CommonJS:



```id
tsObject.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });const greetings_1 = require("greetings");(0, greetings_1.sayHello)("world");
```



depending on the `module` compiler option (and any applicable module format detection rules, if the `module` option supports more than one kind of module). In general, this means that looking at the contents of an input file isn’t enough to determine whether it’s an ES module or a CJS module.

 

Today, most TypeScript files are authored using ESM syntax (`import` and `export` statements) regardless of the output format. This is largely a legacy of the long road ESM has taken to widespread support. ECMAScript modules were standardized in 2015, were supported in most browsers by 2017, and landed in Node.js v12 in 2019. During much of this window, it was clear that ESM was the future of JavaScript modules, but very few runtimes could consume it. Tools like Babel made it possible for JavaScript to be authored in ESM and downleveled to another module format that could be used in Node.js or browsers. TypeScript followed suit, adding support for ES module syntax and softly discouraging the use of the original CommonJS-inspired `import fs = require("fs")` syntax in the 1.5 release .

The upside of this “author ESM, output anything” strategy was that TypeScript could use standard JavaScript syntax, making the authoring experience familiar to newcomers, and (theoretically) making it easy for projects to start targeting ESM outputs in the future. There are three significant downsides, which became fully apparent only after ESM and CJS modules were allowed to coexist and interoperate in Node.js:

- Early assumptions about how ESM/CJS interoperability would work in Node.js turned out to be wrong, and today, interoperability rules differ between Node.js and bundlers. Consequently, the configuration space for modules in TypeScript is large.

- When the syntax in input files all looks like ESM, it’s easy for an author or code reviewer to lose track of what kind of module a file is at runtime. And because of Node.js’s interoperability rules, what kind of module each file is became very important.

- When input files are written in ESM, the syntax in type declaration outputs (`.d.ts` files) looks like ESM too. But because the corresponding JavaScript files could have been emitted in any module format, TypeScript can’t tell what kind of module a file is just by looking at the contents of its type declarations. And again, because of the nature of ESM/CJS interoperability, TypeScript has to know what kind of module everything is in order to provide correct types and prevent imports that will crash.

In TypeScript 5.0, a new compiler option called `verbatimModuleSyntax` was introduced to help TypeScript authors know exactly how their `import` and `export` statements will be emitted. When enabled, the flag requires imports and exports in input files to be written in the form that will undergo the least amount of transformation before emit. So if a file will be emitted as ESM, imports and exports must be written in ESM syntax; if a file will be emitted as CJS, it must be written in the CommonJS-inspired TypeScript syntax (`import fs = require("fs")` and `export = {}`). This setting is particularly recommended for Node.js projects that use mostly ESM, but have a select few CJS files. It is not recommended for projects that currently target CJS, but may want to target ESM in the future.

 

### ESM and CJS interoperability

Can an ES module `import` a CommonJS module? If so, does a default import link to `exports` or `exports.default`? Can a CommonJS module `require` an ES module? CommonJS isn’t part of the ECMAScript specification, so runtimes, bundlers, and transpilers have been free to make up their own answers to these questions since ESM was standardized in 2015, and as such no standard set of interoperability rules exist. Today, most runtimes and bundlers broadly fall into one of three categories:

- ESM-only. Some runtimes, like browser engines, only support what’s actually a part of the language: ECMAScript Modules.

- Bundler-like. Before any major JavaScript engine could run ES modules, Babel allowed developers to write them by transpiling them to CommonJS. The way these ESM-transpiled-to-CJS files interacted with hand-written-CJS files implied a set of permissive interoperability rules that have become the de facto standard for bundlers and transpilers.

- Node.js. Until Node.js v20.19.0, CommonJS modules could not load ES modules synchronously (with `require`); they could only load them asynchronously with dynamic `import()` calls. ES modules can default-import CJS modules, which always binds to `exports`. (This means that a default import of a Babel-like CJS output with `__esModule` behaves differently between Node.js and some bundlers.)

TypeScript needs to know which of these rule sets to assume in order to provide correct types on (particularly `default`) imports and to error on imports that will crash at runtime. When the `module` compiler option is set to `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext`, Node.js’s version-specific rules are enforced. 1 All other `module` settings, combined with the `esModuleInterop` option, result in bundler-like interop in TypeScript. (While using `--module esnext` does prevent you from writing CommonJS modules, it does not prevent you from importing them as dependencies. There’s currently no TypeScript setting that can guard against an ES module importing a CommonJS module, as would be appropriate for direct-to-browser code.)

### Module specifiers are not transformed by default

While the `module` compiler option can transform imports and exports in input files to different module formats in output files, the module specifier (the string `from` which you `import`, or pass to `require`) is emitted as-written. For example, an input like:



```id
tsimport { add } from "./math.mjs";add(1, 2);
```



might be emitted as either:



```id
tsimport { add } from "./math.mjs";add(1, 2);
```



or:



```id
tsconst math_1 = require("./math.mjs");math_1.add(1, 2);
```



depending on the `module` compiler option, but the module specifier will be `"./math.mjs"` either way. By default, module specifiers must be written in a way that works for the code’s target runtime or bundler, and it’s TypeScript’s job to understand those output -relative specifiers. The process of finding the file referenced by a module specifier is called module resolution .

 

TypeScript 5.7 introduced the `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` option , which transforms relative module specifiers with `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, or `.cts` extensions to their JavaScript equivalents in output files. This option is useful for creating TypeScript files that can be run directly in Node.js during development and still be compiled to JavaScript outputs for distribution or production use.

This documentation was written before the introduction of `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`, and the mental model it presents is built around modeling the behavior of the host module system operating on its input files, whether that’s a bundler operating on TypeScript files or a runtime operating on `.js` outputs. With `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`, the way to apply that mental model is to apply it twice : once to the runtime or bundler processing the TypeScript input files directly, and once again to the runtime or bundler processing the transformed outputs. Most of this documentation assumes that only the input files or only the output files will be loaded, but the principles it presents can be extended to the case where both are loaded.

 

## Module resolution

Let’s return to our first example and review what we’ve learned about it so far:



```id
tsimport sayHello from "greetings";sayHello("world");
```



So far, we’ve discussed how the host’s module system and TypeScript’s `module` compiler option might impact this code. We know that the input syntax looks like ESM, but the output format depends on the `module` compiler option, potentially the file extension, and `package.json` `"type"` field. We also know that what `sayHello` gets bound to, and even whether the import is even allowed, may vary depending on the module kinds of this file and the target file. But we haven’t yet discussed how to find the target file.

### Module resolution is host-defined

While the ECMAScript specification defines how to parse and interpret `import` and `export` statements, it leaves module resolution up to the host. If you’re creating a hot new JavaScript runtime, you’re free to create a module resolution scheme like:



```id
tsimport monkey from "🐒"; // Looks for './eats/bananas.js'import cow from "🐄";    // Looks for './eats/grass.js'import lion from "🦁";   // Looks for './eats/you.js'
```



and still claim to implement “standards-compliant ESM.” Needless to say, TypeScript would have no idea what types to assign to `monkey`, `cow`, and `lion` without built-in knowledge of this runtime’s module resolution algorithm. Just as `module` informs the compiler about the host’s expected module format, `moduleResolution`, along with a few customization options, specify the algorithm the host uses to resolve module specifiers to files. This also clarifies why TypeScript doesn’t modify import specifiers during emit: the relationship between an import specifier and a file on disk (if one even exists) is host-defined, and TypeScript is not a host.

The available `moduleResolution` options are:

- `classic` : TypeScript’s oldest module resolution mode, this is unfortunately the default when `module` is set to anything other than `commonjs`, `node16`, or `nodenext`. It was probably made to provide best-effort resolution for a wide range of RequireJS configurations. It should not be used for new projects (or even old projects that don’t use RequireJS or another AMD module loader), and is scheduled for deprecation in TypeScript 6.0.

- `node10` : Formerly known as `node`, this is the unfortunate default when `module` is set to `commonjs`. It’s a pretty good model of Node.js versions older than v12, and sometimes it’s a passable approximation of how most bundlers do module resolution. It supports looking up packages from `node_modules`, loading directory `index.js` files, and omitting `.js` extensions in relative module specifiers. Because Node.js v12 introduced different module resolution rules for ES modules, though, it’s a very bad model of modern versions of Node.js. It should not be used for new projects.

- `node16` : This is the counterpart of `--module node16` and `--module node18` and is set by default with that `module` setting. Node.js v12 and later support both ESM and CJS, each of which uses its own module resolution algorithm. In Node.js, module specifiers in import statements and dynamic `import()` calls are not allowed to omit file extensions or `/index.js` suffixes, while module specifiers in `require` calls are. This module resolution mode understands and enforces this restriction where necessary, as determined by the module format detection rules instated by `--module node16`/`node18`. (For `node16` and `nodenext`, `module` and `moduleResolution` go hand-in-hand: setting one to `node16` or `nodenext` while setting the other to something else is an error.)

- `nodenext` : Currently identical to `node16`, this is the counterpart of `--module nodenext` and is set by default with that `module` setting. It’s intended to be a forward-looking mode that will support new Node.js module resolution features as they’re added.

- `bundler` : Node.js v12 introduced some new module resolution features for importing npm packages—the `"exports"` and `"imports"` fields of `package.json`—and many bundlers adopted those features without also adopting the stricter rules for ESM imports. This module resolution mode provides a base algorithm for code targeting a bundler. It supports `package.json` `"exports"` and `"imports"` by default, but can be configured to ignore them. It requires setting `module` to `esnext`.

### TypeScript imitates the host’s module resolution, but with types

Remember the three components of TypeScript’s job concerning modules?

- Compile files into a valid output module format 

- Ensure that imports in those outputs will resolve successfully 

- Know what type to assign to imported names .

Module resolution is needed to accomplish last two. But when we spend most of our time working in input files, it can be easy to forget about (2)—that a key component of module resolution is validating that the imports or `require` calls in the output files, containing the same module specifiers as the input files , will actually work at runtime. Let’s look at a new example with multiple files:



```id
ts// @Filename: math.tsexport function add(a: number, b: number) {  return a + b;}// @Filename: main.tsimport { add } from "./math";add(1, 2);
```



When we see the import from `"./math"`, it might be tempting to think, “This is how one TypeScript file refers to another. The compiler follows this (extensionless) path in order to assign a type to `add`.”

 

This isn’t entirely wrong, but the reality is deeper. The resolution of `"./math"` (and subsequently, the type of `add`) need to reflect the reality of what happens at runtime to the output files. A more robust way to think about this process would look like this:

 

This model makes it clear that for TypeScript, module resolution is mostly a matter of accurately modeling the host’s module resolution algorithm between output files, with a little bit of remapping applied to find type information. Let’s look at another example that appears unintuitive through the lens of the simple model, but makes perfect sense with the robust model:



```id
ts// @moduleResolution: node16// @rootDir: src// @outDir: dist// @Filename: src/math.mtsexport function add(a: number, b: number) {  return a + b;}// @Filename: src/main.mtsimport { add } from "./math.mjs";add(1, 2);
```



Node.js ESM `import` declarations use a strict module resolution algorithm that requires relative paths to include file extensions. When we only think about input files, it’s a little strange that `"./math.mjs"` seems to resolve to `math.mts`. Since we’re using an `outDir` to put compiled outputs in a different directory, `math.mjs` doesn’t even exist next to `main.mts`! Why should this resolve? With our new mental model, it’s no problem:

 

Understanding this mental model may not immediately eliminate the strangeness of seeing output file extensions in input files, and it’s natural to think in terms of shortcuts: `"./math.mjs"` refers to the input file `math.mts`. I have to write the output extension, but the compiler knows to look for `.mts` when I write `.mjs`. This shortcut is even how the compiler works internally, but the more robust mental model explains why module resolution in TypeScript works this way: given the constraint that the module specifier in the output file will be the same as the module specifier in the input file, this is the only process that accomplishes our two goals of validating output files and assigning types.

### The role of declaration files

In the previous example, we saw the “remapping” part of module resolution working between input and output files. But what happens when we import library code? Even if the library was written in TypeScript, it may not have published its source code. If we can’t rely on mapping the library’s JavaScript files back to a TypeScript file, we can verify that our import works at runtime, but how do we accomplish our second goal of assigning types?

This is where declaration files (`.d.ts`, `.d.mts`, etc.) come into play. The best way to understand how declaration files are interpreted is to understand where they come from. When you run `tsc --declaration` on an input file, you get one output JavaScript file and one output declaration file:

 

Because of this relationship, the compiler assumes that wherever it sees a declaration file, there is a corresponding JavaScript file that is perfectly described by the type information in the declaration file. For performance reasons, in every module resolution mode, the compiler always looks for TypeScript and declaration files first, and if it finds one, it doesn’t continue looking for the corresponding JavaScript file. If it finds a TypeScript input file, it knows a JavaScript file will exist after compilation, and if it finds a declaration file, it knows a compilation (perhaps someone else’s) already happened and created a JavaScript file at the same time as the declaration file.

The declaration file tells the compiler not only that a JavaScript file exists, but also what its name and extension are:

 
 
 
 Declaration file extension 
 JavaScript file extension 
 TypeScript file extension 
 
 
 
 
 `.d.ts` 
 `.js` 
 `.ts` 
 
 
 `.d.ts` 
 `.js` 
 `.tsx` 
 
 
 `.d.mts` 
 `.mjs` 
 `.mts` 
 
 
 `.d.cts` 
 `.cjs` 
 `.cts` 
 
 
 `.d.*.ts` 
 `.*` 
 
 
 
 

The last row expresses that non-JS files can be typed with the `allowArbitraryExtensions` compiler option to support cases where the module system supports importing non-JS files as JavaScript objects. For example, a file named `styles.css` can be represented by a declaration file named `styles.d.css.ts`.

 

“But wait! Plenty of declaration files are written by hand, not generated by `tsc`. Ever heard of DefinitelyTyped?” you might object. And it’s true—hand-writing declaration files, or even moving/copying/renaming them to represent outputs of an external build tool, is a dangerous, error-prone venture. DefinitelyTyped contributors and authors of typed libraries not using `tsc` to generate both JavaScript and declaration files should ensure that every JavaScript file has a sibling declaration file with the same name and matching extension. Breaking from this structure can lead to false-positive TypeScript errors for end users. The npm package `@arethetypeswrong/cli` can help catch and explain these errors before they’re published.

 

### Module resolution for bundlers, TypeScript runtimes, and Node.js loaders

So far, we’ve really emphasized the distinction between input files and output files . Recall that when specifying a file extension on a relative module specifier, TypeScript typically makes you use the output file extension :



```id
ts// @Filename: src/math.tsexport function add(a: number, b: number) {  return a + b;}// @Filename: src/main.tsimport { add } from "./math.ts";//                  ^^^^^^^^^^^// An import path can only end with a '.ts' extension when 'allowImportingTsExtensions' is enabled.
```



This restriction applies since TypeScript won’t rewrite the extension to `.js`, and if `"./math.ts"` appears in an output JS file, that import won’t resolve to another JS file at runtime. TypeScript really wants to prevent you from generating an unsafe output JS file. But what if there is no output JS file? What if you’re in one of these situations:

- You’re bundling this code, the bundler is configured to transpile TypeScript files in-memory, and it will eventually consume and erase all the imports you’ve written to produce a bundle.

- You’re running this code directly in a TypeScript runtime like Node, Deno or Bun.

- You’re using `ts-node`, `tsx`, or another transpiling loader for Node.

In these cases, you can turn on `noEmit` (or `emitDeclarationOnly`) and `allowImportingTsExtensions` to disable emitting unsafe JavaScript files and silence the error on `.ts`-extensioned imports.

With or without `allowImportingTsExtensions`, it’s still important to pick the most appropriate `moduleResolution` setting for the module resolution host. For bundlers and the Bun runtime, it’s `bundler`. These module resolvers were inspired by Node.js, but didn’t adopt the strict ESM resolution algorithm that disables extension searching that Node.js applies to imports. The `bundler` module resolution setting reflects this, enabling `package.json` `"exports"` support like `node16`—`nodenext`, while always allowing extensionless imports. See Choosing compiler options for more guidance.

### Module resolution for libraries

When compiling an app, you choose the `moduleResolution` option for a TypeScript project based on who the module resolution host is. When compiling a library, you don’t know where the output code will run, but you’d like it to run in as many places as possible. Using `"module": "node18"` (along with the implied `"moduleResolution": "node16"` ) is the best bet for maximizing the compatibility of the output JavaScript’s module specifiers, since it will force you to comply with Node.js’s stricter rules for `import` module resolution. Let’s look at what would happen if a library were to compile with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` (or worse, `"node10"`):



```id
tsexport * from "./utils";
```



Assuming `./utils.ts` (or `./utils/index.ts`) exists, a bundler would be fine with this code, so `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` doesn’t complain. Compiled with `"module": "esnext"`, the output JavaScript for this export statement will look exactly the same as the input. If that JavaScript were published to npm, it would be usable by projects that use a bundler, but it would cause an error when run in Node.js:



```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../node_modules/dependency/utils' imported from .../node_modules/dependency/index.jsDid you mean to import ./utils.js?
```



On the other hand, if we had written:



```id
tsexport * from "./utils.js";
```



This would produce output that works both in Node.js and in bundlers.

In short, `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` is infectious, allowing code that only works in bundlers to be produced. Likewise, `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` is only checking that the output works in Node.js, but in most cases, module code that works in Node.js will work in other runtimes and in bundlers.

Of course, this guidance can only apply in cases where the library ships outputs from `tsc`. If the library is being bundled before shipping, `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` may be acceptable. Any build tool that changes the module format or module specifiers to produce the final build of the library bears the responsibility of ensuring the safety and compatibility of the product’s module code, and `tsc` can no longer contribute to that task, since it can’t know what module code will exist at runtime.

 
 

- In Node.js v20.19.0 and later, a `require` of an ES module is allowed, but only if the resolved module and its top-level imports don’t use top-level `await`. TypeScript does not try to enforce this rule, as it lacks the ability to tell from a declaration file whether the corresponding JavaScript file contains top-level `await`. ↩

# Namespaces and Modules

 

This post outlines the various ways to organize your code using modules and namespaces in TypeScript.
We’ll also go over some advanced topics of how to use namespaces and modules, and address some common pitfalls when using them in TypeScript.

See the Modules documentation for more information about ES Modules.
See the Namespaces documentation for more information about TypeScript namespaces.

Note: In very old versions of TypeScript namespaces were called ‘Internal Modules’, these pre-date JavaScript module systems.

## Using Modules

Modules can contain both code and declarations.

Modules also have a dependency on a module loader (such as CommonJs/Require.js) or a runtime which supports ES Modules.
Modules provide for better code reuse, stronger isolation and better tooling support for bundling.

It is also worth noting that, for Node.js applications, modules are the default and we recommended modules over namespaces in modern code .

Starting with ECMAScript 2015, modules are native part of the language, and should be supported by all compliant engine implementations.
Thus, for new projects modules would be the recommended code organization mechanism.

## Using Namespaces

 Namespaces are a TypeScript-specific way to organize code.

Namespaces are simply named JavaScript objects in the global namespace.
This makes namespaces a very simple construct to use.
Unlike modules, they can span multiple files, and can be concatenated using `outFile` .
Namespaces can be a good way to structure your code in a Web Application, with all dependencies included as `

# Modules - Choosing Compiler Options

 

## I’m writing an app

A single tsconfig.json can only represent a single environment, both in terms of what globals are available and in terms of how modules behave. If your app contains server code, DOM code, web worker code, test code, and code to be shared by all of those, each of those should have its own tsconfig.json, connected with project references . Then, use this guide once for each tsconfig.json. For library-like projects within an app, especially ones that need to run in multiple runtime environments, use the “ I’m writing a library ” section.

### I’m using a bundler

In addition to adopting the following settings, it’s also recommended not to set `{ "type": "module" }` or use `.mts` files in bundler projects for now. Some bundlers adopt different ESM/CJS interop behavior under these circumstances, which TypeScript cannot currently analyze with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`. See issue #54102 for more information.



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    // This is not a complete template; it only    // shows relevant module-related settings.    // Be sure to set other important options    // like `target`, `lib`, and `strict`.    // Required    "module": "esnext",    "moduleResolution": "bundler",    "esModuleInterop": true,    // Consult your bundler’s documentation    "customConditions": ["module"],    // Recommended    "noEmit": true, // or `emitDeclarationOnly`    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,    "allowArbitraryExtensions": true,    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true, // or `isolatedModules`  }}
```



### I’m compiling and running the outputs in Node.js

Remember to set `"type": "module"` or use `.mts` files if you intend to emit ES modules.



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    // This is not a complete template; it only    // shows relevant module-related settings.    // Be sure to set other important options    // like `target`, `lib`, and `strict`.    // Required    "module": "nodenext",    // Implied by `"module": "nodenext"`:    // "moduleResolution": "nodenext",    // "esModuleInterop": true,    // "target": "esnext",    // Recommended    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,  }}
```



### I’m using ts-node

ts-node attempts to be compatible with the same code and the same tsconfig.json settings that can be used to compile and run the JS outputs in Node.js . Refer to ts-node documentation for more details.

### I’m using tsx

Whereas ts-node makes minimal modifications to Node.js’s module system by default, tsx behaves more like a bundler, allowing extensionless/index module specifiers and arbitrary mixing of ESM and CJS. Use the same settings for tsx as you would for a bundler .

### I’m writing ES modules for the browser, with no bundler or module compiler

TypeScript does not currently have options dedicated to this scenario, but you can approximate them by using a combination of the `nodenext` ESM module resolution algorithm and `paths` as a substitute for URL and import map support.



```id
json// tsconfig.json{  "compilerOptions": {    // This is not a complete template; it only    // shows relevant module-related settings.    // Be sure to set other important options    // like `target`, `lib`, and `strict`.    // Combined with `"type": "module"` in a local package.json,    // this enforces including file extensions on relative path imports.    "module": "nodenext",    "paths": {      // Point TS to local types for remote URLs:      "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21": ["./node_modules/@types/lodash/index.d.ts"],      // Optional: point bare specifier imports to an empty file      // to prohibit importing from node_modules specifiers not listed here:      "*": ["./empty-file.ts"]    }  }}
```



This setup allows explicitly listed HTTPS imports to use locally-installed type declaration files, while erroring on imports that would normally resolve in node_modules:



```id
tsimport {} from "lodash";//             ^^^^^^^^// File '/project/empty-file.ts' is not a module. ts(2306)
```



Alternatively, you can use import maps to explicitly map a list of bare specifiers to URLs in the browser, while relying on `nodenext`’s default node_modules lookups, or on `paths`, to direct TypeScript to type declaration files for those bare specifier imports:



```id
html<script type="importmap">{  "imports": {    "lodash": "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21"  }}</script>
```




```id
tsimport {} from "lodash";// Browser: https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21// TypeScript: ./node_modules/@types/lodash/index.d.ts
```



## I’m writing a library

 

Choosing compilation settings as a library author is a fundamentally different process from choosing settings as an app author. When writing an app, settings are chosen that reflect the runtime environment or bundler—typically a single entity with known behavior. When writing a library, you would ideally check your code under all possible library consumer compilation settings. Since this is impractical, you can instead use the strictest possible settings, since satisfying those tends to satisfy all others.



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "node18",    "target": "es2020", // set to the *lowest* target you support    "strict": true,    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,    "declaration": true,    "sourceMap": true,    "declarationMap": true,    "rootDir": "src",    "outDir": "dist"  }}
```



Let’s examine why we picked each of these settings:

 

 `module: "node18"` . When a codebase is compatible with Node.js’s module system, it almost always works in bundlers as well. If you’re using a third-party emitter to emit ESM outputs, ensure that you set `"type": "module"` in your package.json so TypeScript checks your code as ESM, which uses a stricter module resolution algorithm in Node.js than CommonJS does. As an example, let’s look at what would happen if a library were to compile with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`:



```id
tsexport * from "./utils";
```



Assuming `./utils.ts` (or `./utils/index.ts`) exists, a bundler would be fine with this code, so `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` doesn’t complain. Compiled with `"module": "esnext"`, the output JavaScript for this export statement will look exactly the same as the input. If that JavaScript were published to npm, it would be usable by projects that use a bundler, but it would cause an error when run in Node.js:



```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../node_modules/dependency/utils' imported from .../node_modules/dependency/index.jsDid you mean to import ./utils.js?
```



On the other hand, if we had written:



```id
tsexport * from "./utils.js";
```



This would produce output that works both in Node.js and in bundlers.

In short, `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` is infectious, allowing code that only works in bundlers to be produced. Likewise, `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` is only checking that the output works in Node.js, but in most cases, module code that works in Node.js will work in other runtimes and in bundlers.

- 

 `target: "es2020"` . Setting this value to the lowest ECMAScript version that you intend to support ensures the emitted code will not use language features introduced in a later version. Since `target` also implies a corresponding value for `lib`, this also ensures you don’t access globals that may not be available in older environments.

- 

 `strict: true` . Without this, you may write type-level code that ends up in your output `.d.ts` files and errors when a consumer compiles with `strict` enabled. For example, this `extends` clause:



```id
tsexport interface Super {  foo: string;}export interface Sub extends Super {  foo: string | undefined;}
```



is only an error under `strictNullChecks`. On the other hand, it’s very difficult to write code that errors only when `strict` is disabled , so it’s highly recommended for libraries to compile with `strict`.

- 

 `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` . This setting protects against a few module-related pitfalls that can cause problems for library consumers. First, it prevents writing any import statements that could be interpreted ambiguously based on the user’s value of `esModuleInterop` or `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`. Previously, it was often suggested that libraries compile without `esModuleInterop`, since its use in libraries could force users to adopt it too. However, it’s also possible to write imports that only work without `esModuleInterop`, so neither value for the setting guarantees portability for libraries. `verbatimModuleSyntax` does provide such a guarantee. 1 Second, it prevents the use of `export default` in modules that will be emitted as CommonJS, which can require bundler users and Node.js ESM users to consume the module differently. See the appendix on ESM/CJS Interop for more details.

- 

 `declaration: true` emits type declaration files alongside the output JavaScript. This is needed for consumers of the library to have any type information.

- 

 `sourceMap: true` and `declarationMap: true` emit source maps for the output JavaScript and type declaration files, respectively. These are only useful if the library also ships its source (`.ts`) files. By shipping source maps and source files, consumers of the library will be able to debug the library code somewhat more easily. By shipping declaration maps and source files, consumers will be able to see the original TypeScript sources when they run Go To Definition on imports from the libraries. Both of these represent a tradeoff between developer experience and library size, so it’s up to you whether to include them.

- 

 `rootDir: "src"` and `outDir: "dist"` . Using a separate output directory is always a good idea, but it’s necessary for libraries that publish their input files. Otherwise, extension substitution will cause the library’s consumers to load the library’s `.ts` files instead of `.d.ts` files, causing type errors and performance problems.

### Considerations for bundling libraries

If you’re using a bundler to emit your library, then all your (non-externalized) imports will be processed by the bundler with known behavior, not by your users’ unknowable environments. In this case, you can use `"module": "esnext"` and `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`, but only with two caveats:

- 

TypeScript cannot model module resolution when some files are bundled and some are externalized. When bundling libraries with dependencies, it’s common to bundle the first-party library source code into a single file, but leave imports of external dependencies as real imports in the bundled output. This essentially means module resolution is split between the bundler and the end user’s environment. To model this in TypeScript, you would want to process bundled imports with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` and externalized imports with `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` (or with multiple options to check that everything will work in a range of end-user environments). But TypeScript cannot be configured to use two different module resolution settings in the same compilation. As a consequence, using `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` may allow imports of externalized dependencies that would work in a bundler but are unsafe in Node.js. On the other hand, using `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` may impose overly strict requirements on bundled imports.

- 

You must ensure that your declaration files get bundled as well. Recall the first rule of declaration files : every declaration file represents exactly one JavaScript file. If you use `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` and use a bundler to emit an ESM bundle while using `tsc` to emit many individual declaration files, your declaration files may cause errors when consumed under `"module": "nodenext"`. For example, an input file like:



```id
tsimport { Component } from "./extensionless-relative-import";
```



will have its import erased by the JS bundler, but produce a declaration file with an identical import statement. That import statement, however, will contain an invalid module specifier in Node.js, since it’s missing a file extension. For Node.js users, TypeScript will error on the declaration file and infect types referencing `Component` with `any`, assuming the dependency will crash at runtime.

If your TypeScript bundler does not produce bundled declaration files, use `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` to ensure that the imports preserved in your declaration files will be compatible with end-users’ TypeScript settings. Even better, consider not bundling your library.

### Notes on dual-emit solutions

A single TypeScript compilation (whether emitting or just type checking) assumes that each input file will only produce one output file. Even if `tsc` isn’t emitting anything, the type checking it performs on imported names rely on knowledge about how the output file will behave at runtime, based on the module- and emit-related options set in the tsconfig.json. While third-party emitters are generally safe to use in combination with `tsc` type checking as long as `tsc` can be configured to understand what the other emitter will emit, any solution that emits two different sets of outputs with different module formats while only type checking once leaves (at least) one of the outputs unchecked. Because external dependencies may expose different APIs to CommonJS and ESM consumers, there’s no configuration you can use to guarantee in a single compilation that both outputs will be type-safe. In practice, most dependencies follow best practices and dual-emit outputs work. Running tests and static analysis against all output bundles before publishing significantly reduces the chance of a serious problem going unnoticed.

 
 

- `verbatimModuleSyntax` can only work when the JS emitter emits the same module kind as `tsc` would given the tsconfig.json, source file extension, and package.json `"type"`. The option works by enforcing that the `import`/`require` written is identical to the `import`/`require` emitted. Any configuration that produces both an ESM and a CJS output from the same source file is fundamentally incompatible with `verbatimModuleSyntax`, since its whole purpose is to prevent you from writing `import` anywhere that a `require` would be emitted. `verbatimModuleSyntax` can also be defeated by configuring a third-party emitter to emit a different module kind than `tsc` would—for example, by setting `"module": "esnext"` in tsconfig.json while configuring Babel to emit CommonJS. ↩

### TypeScript: Documentation - Symbols

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/symbols.html#handbook-content

TypeScript: Documentation - Symbols 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Symbols

 

Starting with ECMAScript 2015, `symbol` is a primitive data type, just like `number` and `string`.

`symbol` values are created by calling the `Symbol` constructor.



```id
tslet sym1 = Symbol();let sym2 = Symbol("key"); // optional string key
```



Symbols are immutable, and unique.



```id
tslet sym2 = Symbol("key");let sym3 = Symbol("key");sym2 === sym3; // false, symbols are unique
```



Just like strings, symbols can be used as keys for object properties.



```id
tsconst sym = Symbol();let obj = {  [sym]: "value",};console.log(obj[sym]); // "value"
```



Symbols can also be combined with computed property declarations to declare object properties and class members.



```id
tsconst getClassNameSymbol = Symbol();class C {  [getClassNameSymbol]() {    return "C";  }}let c = new C();let className = c[getClassNameSymbol](); // "C"
```



## `unique symbol`

To enable treating symbols as unique literals a special type `unique symbol` is available. `unique symbol` is a subtype of `symbol`, and are produced only from calling `Symbol()` or `Symbol.for()`, or from explicit type annotations. This type is only allowed on `const` declarations and `readonly static` properties, and in order to reference a specific unique symbol, you’ll have to use the `typeof` operator. Each reference to a unique symbol implies a completely unique identity that’s tied to a given declaration.



```id
tsdeclare const sym1: unique symbol; // sym2 can only be a constant reference.let sym2: unique symbol =  symbol' >Symbol();A variable whose type is a 'unique symbol' type must be 'const'.1332A variable whose type is a 'unique symbol' type must be 'const'. // Works - refers to a unique symbol, but its identity is tied to &apos;sym1&apos;.let sym3: typeof sym1 = sym1; // Also works.class C {  static readonly StaticSymbol: unique symbol =  symbol' >Symbol();}Try
```



Because each `unique symbol` has a completely separate identity, no two `unique symbol` types are assignable or comparable to each other.



```id
tsconst sym2 =  symbol' >Symbol();const sym3 =  symbol' >Symbol(); if (sym2 === sym3) {This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof sym2' and 'typeof sym3' have no overlap.2367This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof sym2' and 'typeof sym3' have no overlap.  // ...}Try
```



## Well-known Symbols

In addition to user-defined symbols, there are well-known built-in symbols.
Built-in symbols are used to represent internal language behaviors.

Here is a list of well-known symbols:

### `Symbol.asyncIterator`

A method that returns async iterator for an object, compatible to be used with for await..of loop.

### `Symbol.hasInstance`

A method that determines if a constructor object recognizes an object as one of the constructor’s instances. Called by the semantics of the instanceof operator.

### `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`

A Boolean value indicating that an object should be flattened to its array elements by Array.prototype.concat.

### `Symbol.iterator`

A method that returns the default iterator for an object. Called by the semantics of the for-of statement.

### `Symbol.match`

A regular expression method that matches the regular expression against a string. Called by the `String.prototype.match` method.

### `Symbol.replace`

A regular expression method that replaces matched substrings of a string. Called by the `String.prototype.replace` method.

### `Symbol.search`

A regular expression method that returns the index within a string that matches the regular expression. Called by the `String.prototype.search` method.

### `Symbol.species`

A function valued property that is the constructor function that is used to create derived objects.

### `Symbol.split`

A regular expression method that splits a string at the indices that match the regular expression.
Called by the `String.prototype.split` method.

### `Symbol.toPrimitive`

A method that converts an object to a corresponding primitive value.
Called by the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation.

### `Symbol.toStringTag`

A String value that is used in the creation of the default string description of an object.
Called by the built-in method `Object.prototype.toString`.

### `Symbol.unscopables`

An Object whose own property names are property names that are excluded from the ‘with’ environment bindings of the associated objects.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Triple-Slash Directives

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html#handbook-content

TypeScript: Documentation - Triple-Slash Directives 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Triple-Slash Directives

 

Triple-slash directives are single-line comments containing a single XML tag.
The contents of the comment are used as compiler directives.

Triple-slash directives are only valid at the top of their containing file.
A triple-slash directive can only be preceded by single or multi-line comments, including other triple-slash directives.
If they are encountered following a statement or a declaration they are treated as regular single-line comments, and hold no special meaning.

As of TypeScript 5.5, the compiler does not generate reference directives, and does not emit handwritten triple-slash directives to output files unless those directives are marked as `preserve="true"` .

## `/// `

The `/// ` directive is the most common of this group.
It serves as a declaration of dependency between files.

Triple-slash references instruct the compiler to include additional files in the compilation process.

They also serve as a method to order the output when using `out` or `outFile` .
Files are emitted to the output file location in the same order as the input after preprocessing pass.

### Preprocessing input files

The compiler performs a preprocessing pass on input files to resolve all triple-slash reference directives.
During this process, additional files are added to the compilation.

The process starts with a set of root files ;
these are the file names specified on the command-line or in the `files` list in the `tsconfig.json` file.
These root files are preprocessed in the same order they are specified.
Before a file is added to the list, all triple-slash references in it are processed, and their targets included.
Triple-slash references are resolved in a depth-first manner, in the order they have been seen in the file.

A triple-slash reference path is resolved relative to the containing file, if a relative path is used.

### Errors

It is an error to reference a file that does not exist.
It is an error for a file to have a triple-slash reference to itself.

### Using `--noResolve`

If the compiler flag `noResolve` is specified, triple-slash references are ignored; they neither result in adding new files, nor change the order of the files provided.

## `/// `

Similar to a `/// ` directive, which serves as a declaration of dependency , a `/// ` directive declares a dependency on a package.

The process of resolving these package names is similar to the process of resolving module names in an `import` statement.
An easy way to think of triple-slash-reference-types directives are as an `import` for declaration packages.

For example, including `/// ` in a declaration file declares that this file uses names declared in `@types/node/index.d.ts`;
and thus, this package needs to be included in the compilation along with the declaration file.

For declaring a dependency on an `@types` package in a `.ts` file, use `types` on the command line or in your `tsconfig.json` instead.
See using `@types`, `typeRoots` and `types` in `tsconfig.json` files for more details.

## `/// `

This directive allows a file to explicitly include an existing built-in lib file.

Built-in lib files are referenced in the same fashion as the `lib` compiler option in tsconfig.json (e.g. use `lib="es2015"` and not `lib="lib.es2015.d.ts"`, etc.).

For declaration file authors who rely on built-in types, e.g. DOM APIs or built-in JS run-time constructors like `Symbol` or `Iterable`, triple-slash-reference lib directives are recommended. Previously these .d.ts files had to add forward/duplicate declarations of such types.

For example, adding `/// ` to one of the files in a compilation is equivalent to compiling with `--lib es2017.string`.



```id
ts/// <reference lib="es2017.string" />"foo".padStart(4);
```



## `/// `

This directive marks a file as a default library .
You will see this comment at the top of `lib.d.ts` and its different variants.

This directive instructs the compiler to not include the default library (i.e. `lib.d.ts`) in the compilation.
The impact here is similar to passing `noLib` on the command line.

Also note that when passing `skipDefaultLibCheck` , the compiler will only skip checking files with `/// `.

## `/// `

By default AMD modules are generated anonymous.
This can lead to problems when other tools are used to process the resulting modules, such as bundlers (e.g. `r.js`).

The `amd-module` directive allows passing an optional module name to the compiler:

 amdModule.ts 


```id
ts/// <amd-module name="NamedModule"/>export class C {}
```



Will result in assigning the name `NamedModule` to the module as part of calling the AMD `define`:

 amdModule.js 


```id
jsdefine("NamedModule", ["require", "exports"], function (require, exports) {  var C = (function () {    function C() {}    return C;  })();  exports.C = C;});
```



## `/// `

 

 Note : this directive has been deprecated. Use `import "moduleName";` statements instead.

 

`/// ` informs the compiler about a non-TS module dependency that needs to be injected in the resulting module’s require call.

The `amd-dependency` directive can also have an optional `name` property; this allows passing an optional name for an amd-dependency:



```id
ts/// <amd-dependency path="legacy/moduleA" name="moduleA"/>declare var moduleA: MyType;moduleA.callStuff();
```



Generated JS code:



```id
jsdefine(["require", "exports", "legacy/moduleA"], function (  require,  exports,  moduleA) {  moduleA.callStuff();});
```



## `preserve="true"`

Triple-slash directives can be marked with `preserve="true"` to prevent the compiler from removing them from the output.

For example, these will be erased in the output:



```id
ts/// <reference path="..." />/// <reference types="..." />/// <reference lib="..." />
```



But these will be preserved:



```id
ts/// <reference path="..." preserve="true" />/// <reference types="..." preserve="true" />/// <reference lib="..." preserve="true" />
```

### TypeScript: Documentation - Modules - Reference

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/reference.html

# Modules - Reference

 

## Module syntax

The TypeScript compiler recognizes standard ECMAScript module syntax in TypeScript and JavaScript files and many forms of CommonJS syntax in JavaScript files.

There are also a few TypeScript-specific syntax extensions that can be used in TypeScript files and/or JSDoc comments.

### Importing and exporting TypeScript-specific declarations

Type aliases, interfaces, enums, and namespaces can be exported from a module with an `export` modifier, like any standard JavaScript declaration:



```id
ts// Standard JavaScript syntax...export function f() {}// ...extended to type declarationsexport type SomeType = /* ... */;export interface SomeInterface { /* ... */ }
```



They can also be referenced in named exports, even alongside references to standard JavaScript declarations:



```id
tsexport { f, SomeType, SomeInterface };
```



Exported types (and other TypeScript-specific declarations) can be imported with standard ECMAScript imports:



```id
tsimport { f, SomeType, SomeInterface } from "./module.js";
```



When using namespace imports or exports, exported types are available on the namespace when referenced in a type position:



```id
tsimport * as mod from "./module.js";mod.f();mod.SomeType; // Property 'SomeType' does not exist on type 'typeof import("./module.js")'let x: mod.SomeType; // Ok
```



### Type-only imports and exports

When emitting imports and exports to JavaScript, by default, TypeScript automatically elides (does not emit) imports that are only used in type positions and exports that only refer to types. Type-only imports and exports can be used to force this behavior and make the elision explicit. Import declarations written with `import type`, export declarations written with `export type { ... }`, and import or export specifiers prefixed with the `type` keyword are all guaranteed to be elided from the output JavaScript.



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport { f, type SomeInterface } from "./module.js";import type { SomeType } from "./module.js";class C implements SomeInterface {  constructor(p: SomeType) {    f();  }}export type { C };// @Filename: main.jsimport { f } from "./module.js";class C {  constructor(p) {    f();  }}
```



Even values can be imported with `import type`, but since they won’t exist in the output JavaScript, they can only be used in non-emitting positions:



```id
tsimport type { f } from "./module.js";f(); // 'f' cannot be used as a value because it was imported using 'import type'let otherFunction: typeof f = () => {}; // Ok
```



A type-only import declaration may not declare both a default import and named bindings, since it appears ambiguous whether `type` applies to the default import or to the entire import declaration. Instead, split the import declaration into two, or use `default` as a named binding:



```id
tsimport type fs, { BigIntOptions } from "fs";//          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^// Error: A type-only import can specify a default import or named bindings, but not both.import type { default as fs, BigIntOptions } from "fs"; // Ok
```



### `import()` types

TypeScript provides a type syntax similar to JavaScript’s dynamic `import` for referencing the type of a module without writing an import declaration:



```id
ts// Access an exported type:type WriteFileOptions = import("fs").WriteFileOptions;// Access the type of an exported value:type WriteFileFunction = typeof import("fs").writeFile;
```



This is especially useful in JSDoc comments in JavaScript files, where it’s not possible to import types otherwise:



```id
ts/** @type {import("webpack").Configuration} */module.exports = {  // ...}
```



### `export =` and `import = require()`

When emitting CommonJS modules, TypeScript files can use a direct analog of `module.exports = ...` and `const mod = require("...")` JavaScript syntax:



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport fs = require("fs");export = fs.readFileSync("...");// @Filename: main.js"use strict";const fs = require("fs");module.exports = fs.readFileSync("...");
```



This syntax was used over its JavaScript counterparts since variable declarations and property assignments could not refer to TypeScript types, whereas special TypeScript syntax could:



```id
ts// @Filename: a.tsinterface Options { /* ... */ }module.exports = Options; // Error: 'Options' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.export = Options; // Ok// @Filename: b.tsconst Options = require("./a");const options: Options = { /* ... */ }; // Error: 'Options' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here.// @Filename: c.tsimport Options = require("./a");const options: Options = { /* ... */ }; // Ok
```



### Ambient modules

TypeScript supports a syntax in script (non-module) files for declaring a module that exists in the runtime but has no corresponding file. These ambient modules usually represent runtime-provided modules, like `"fs"` or `"path"` in Node.js:



```id
tsdeclare module "path" {  export function normalize(p: string): string;  export function join(...paths: any[]): string;  export var sep: string;}
```



Once an ambient module is loaded into a TypeScript program, TypeScript will recognize imports of the declared module in other files:



```id
ts// 👇 Ensure the ambient module is loaded -//    may be unnecessary if path.d.ts is included//    by the project tsconfig.json somehow./// <reference path="path.d.ts" />import { normalize, join } from "path";
```



Ambient module declarations are easy to confuse with module augmentations since they use identical syntax. This module declaration syntax becomes a module augmentation when the file is a module, meaning it has a top-level `import` or `export` statement (or is affected by `--moduleDetection force` or `auto` ):



```id
ts// Not an ambient module declaration anymore!export {};declare module "path" {  export function normalize(p: string): string;  export function join(...paths: any[]): string;  export var sep: string;}
```



Ambient modules may use imports inside the module declaration body to refer to other modules without turning the containing file into a module (which would make the ambient module declaration a module augmentation):



```id
tsdeclare module "m" {  // Moving this outside "m" would totally change the meaning of the file!  import { SomeType } from "other";  export function f(): SomeType;}
```



A pattern ambient module contains a single `*` wildcard character in its name, matching zero or more characters in import paths. This can be useful for declaring modules provided by custom loaders:



```id
tsdeclare module "*.html" {  const content: string;  export default content;}
```



## The `module` compiler option

This section discusses the details of each `module` compiler option value. See the Module output format theory section for more background on what the option is and how it fits into the overall compilation process. In brief, the `module` compiler option was historically only used to control the output module format of emitted JavaScript files. The more recent `node16`, `node18`, and `nodenext` values, however, describe a wide range of characteristics of Node.js’s module system, including what module formats are supported, how the module format of each file is determined, and how different module formats interoperate.

### `node16`, `node18`, `node20`, `nodenext`

Node.js supports both CommonJS and ECMAScript modules, with specific rules for which format each file can be and how the two formats are allowed to interoperate. `node16`, `node18`, and `nodenext` describe the full range of behavior for Node.js’s dual-format module system, and emit files in either CommonJS or ESM format . This is different from every other `module` option, which are runtime-agnostic and force all output files into a single format, leaving it to the user to ensure the output is valid for their runtime.

 

A common misconception is that `node16`—`nodenext` only emit ES modules. In reality, these modes describe versions of Node.js that support ES modules, not just projects that use ES modules. Both ESM and CommonJS emit are supported, based on the detected module format of each file. Because they are the only `module` options that reflect the complexities of Node.js’s dual module system, they are the only correct `module` options for all apps and libraries that are intended to run in Node.js v12 or later, whether they use ES modules or not.

 

The fixed-version `node16` and `node18` modes represent the module system behavior stabilized in their respective Node.js versions, while the `nodenext` mode changes with the latest stable versions of Node.js. The following table summarizes the current differences between the three modes:

#### Module format detection

 `.mts`/`.mjs`/`.d.mts` files are always ES modules.

- `.cts`/`.cjs`/`.d.cts` files are always CommonJS modules.

- `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.jsx`/`.d.ts` files are ES modules if the nearest ancestor package.json file contains `"type": "module"`, otherwise CommonJS modules.

The detected module format of input `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` files determines the module format of the emitted JavaScript files. So, for example, a project consisting entirely of `.ts` files will emit all CommonJS modules by default under `--module nodenext`, and can be made to emit all ES modules by adding `"type": "module"` to the project package.json.

#### Interoperability rules

- When an ES module references a CommonJS module: 

 The `module.exports` of the CommonJS module is available as a default import to the ES module.

- Properties (other than `default`) of the CommonJS module’s `module.exports` may or may not be available as named imports to the ES module. Node.js attempts to make them available via static analysis . TypeScript cannot know from a declaration file whether that static analysis will succeed, and optimistically assumes it will. This limits TypeScript’s ability to catch named imports that may crash at runtime. See #54018 for more details.

 
- When a CommonJS module references an ES module: 

 In `node16` and `node18`, `require` cannot reference an ES module. For TypeScript, this includes `import` statements in files that are detected to be CommonJS modules, since those `import` statements will be transformed to `require` calls in the emitted JavaScript.

- In `nodenext`, to reflect the behavior of Node.js v22.12.0 and later, `require` can reference an ES module. In Node.js, an error is thrown if the ES module, or any of its imported modules, uses top-level `await`. TypeScript does not attempt to detect this case and will not emit a compile-time error. The result of the `require` call is the module’s Module Namespace Object, i.e., the same as the result of an `await import()` of the same module (but without the need to `await` anything).

- A dynamic `import()` call can always be used to import an ES module. It returns a Promise of the module’s Module Namespace Object (what you’d get from `import * as ns from "./module.js"` from another ES module).

 

#### Emit

The emit format of each file is determined by the detected module format of each file. ESM emit is similar to `--module esnext` , but has a special transformation for `import x = require("...")`, which is not allowed in `--module esnext`:



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport x = require("mod");
```




```id
js// @Filename: main.jsimport { createRequire as _createRequire } from "module";const __require = _createRequire(import.meta.url);const x = __require("mod");
```



CommonJS emit is similar to `--module commonjs` , but dynamic `import()` calls are not transformed. Emit here is shown with `esModuleInterop` enabled:



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport fs from "fs"; // transformedconst dynamic = import("mod"); // not transformed
```




```id
js// @Filename: main.js"use strict";var __importDefault = (this && this.__importDefault) || function (mod) {    return (mod && mod.__esModule) ? mod : { "default": mod };};Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });const fs_1 = __importDefault(require("fs")); // transformedconst dynamic = import("mod"); // not transformed
```



#### Implied and enforced options

- `--module nodenext` implies and enforces `--moduleResolution nodenext`.

- `--module node18` or `node16` implies and enforces `--moduleResolution node16`.

- `--module nodenext` implies `--target esnext`.

- `--module node18` or `node16` implies `--target es2022`.

- `--module nodenext` or `node18` or `node16` implies `--esModuleInterop`.

#### Summary

- `node16`, `node18`, and `nodenext` are the only correct `module` options for all apps and libraries that are intended to run in Node.js v12 or later, whether they use ES modules or not.

- `node16`, `node18`, and `nodenext` emit files in either CommonJS or ESM format, based on the detected module format of each file.

- Node.js’s interoperability rules between ESM and CJS are reflected in type checking.

- ESM emit transforms `import x = require("...")` to a `require` call constructed from a `createRequire` import.

- CommonJS emit leaves dynamic `import()` calls untransformed, so CommonJS modules can asynchronously import ES modules.

### `preserve`

In `--module preserve` ( added in TypeScript 5.4), ECMAScript imports and exports written in input files are preserved in the output, and CommonJS-style `import x = require("...")` and `export = ...` statements are emitted as CommonJS `require` and `module.exports`. In other words, the format of each individual import or export statement is preserved, rather than being coerced into a single format for the whole compilation (or even a whole file).

While it’s rare to need to mix imports and require calls in the same file, this `module` mode best reflects the capabilities of most modern bundlers, as well as the Bun runtime.

 

Why care about TypeScript’s `module` emit with a bundler or with Bun, where you’re likely also setting `noEmit`? TypeScript’s type checking and module resolution behavior are affected by the module format that it would emit. Setting `module` gives TypeScript information about how your bundler or runtime will process imports and exports, which ensures that the types you see on imported values accurately reflect what will happen at runtime or after bundling. See `--moduleResolution bundler` for more discussion.

 

#### Examples



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";import mod = require("mod");const dynamic = import("mod");export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";
```




```id
js// @Filename: main.jsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";const mod = require("mod");const dynamic = import("mod");export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";
```



#### Implied and enforced options

- `--module preserve` implies `--moduleResolution bundler`.

- `--module preserve` implies `--esModuleInterop`.

 

The option `--esModuleInterop` is enabled by default in `--module preserve` only for its type checking behavior. Since imports never transform into require calls in `--module preserve`, `--esModuleInterop` does not affect the emitted JavaScript.

 

### `es2015`, `es2020`, `es2022`, `esnext`

#### Summary

- Use `esnext` with `--moduleResolution bundler` for bundlers, Bun, and tsx.

- Do not use for Node.js. Use `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext` with `"type": "module"` in package.json to emit ES modules for Node.js.

- `import mod = require("mod")` is not allowed in non-declaration files.

- `es2020` adds support for `import.meta` properties.

- `es2022` adds support for top-level `await`.

- `esnext` is a moving target that may include support for Stage 3 proposals to ECMAScript modules.

- Emitted files are ES modules, but dependencies may be any format.

#### Examples



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";import * as mod from "mod";const dynamic = import("mod");console.log(x, y, z, mod, dynamic);export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";
```




```id
js// @Filename: main.jsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";import * as mod from "mod";const dynamic = import("mod");console.log(x, y, z, mod, dynamic);export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";
```



### `commonjs`

#### Summary

- You probably shouldn’t use this. Use `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext` to emit CommonJS modules for Node.js.

- Emitted files are CommonJS modules, but dependencies may be any format.

- Dynamic `import()` is transformed to a Promise of a `require()` call.

- `esModuleInterop` affects the output code for default and namespace imports.

#### Examples

 

Output is shown with `esModuleInterop: false`.

 


```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";import * as mod from "mod";const dynamic = import("mod");console.log(x, y, z, mod, dynamic);export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";

## The `moduleResolution` compiler option

This section describes module resolution features and processes shared by multiple `moduleResolution` modes, then specifies the details of each mode. See the Module resolution theory section for more background on what the option is and how it fits into the overall compilation process. In brief, `moduleResolution` controls how TypeScript resolves module specifiers (string literals in `import`/`export`/`require` statements) to files on disk, and should be set to match the module resolver used by the target runtime or bundler.

### Common features and processes

#### File extension substitution

TypeScript always wants to resolve internally to a file that can provide type information, while ensuring that the runtime or bundler can use the same path to resolve to a file that provides a JavaScript implementation. For any module specifier that would, according to the `moduleResolution` algorithm specified, trigger a lookup of a JavaScript file in the runtime or bundler, TypeScript will first try to find a TypeScript implementation file or type declaration file with the same name and analagous file extension.

 
 
 
 Runtime lookup 
 TypeScript lookup #1 
 TypeScript lookup #2 
 TypeScript lookup #3 
 TypeScript lookup #4 
 TypeScript lookup #5 
 
 
 
 
 `/mod.js` 
 `/mod.ts` 
 `/mod.tsx` 
 `/mod.d.ts` 
 `/mod.js` 
 `./mod.jsx` 
 
 
 `/mod.mjs` 
 `/mod.mts` 
 `/mod.d.mts` 
 `/mod.mjs` 
 
 
 
 
 `/mod.cjs` 
 `/mod.cts` 
 `/mod.d.cts` 
 `/mod.cjs` 
 
 
 
 
 

Note that this behavior is independent of the actual module specifier written in the import. This means that TypeScript can resolve to a `.ts` or `.d.ts` file even if the module specifier explicitly uses a `.js` file extension:



```id
tsimport x from "./mod.js";// Runtime lookup: "./mod.js"// TypeScript lookup #1: "./mod.ts"// TypeScript lookup #2: "./mod.d.ts"// TypeScript lookup #3: "./mod.js"
```



See TypeScript imitates the host’s module resolution, but with types for an explanation of why TypeScript’s module resolution works this way.

#### Relative file path resolution

All of TypeScript’s `moduleResolution` algorithms support referencing a module by a relative path that includes a file extension (which will be substituted according to the rules above ):



```id
ts// @Filename: a.tsexport {};// @Filename: b.tsimport {} from "./a.js"; // ✅ Works in every `moduleResolution`
```



#### Extensionless relative paths

In some cases, the runtime or bundler allows omitting a `.js` file extension from a relative path. TypeScript supports this behavior where the `moduleResolution` setting and the context indicate that the runtime or bundler supports it:



```id
ts// @Filename: a.tsexport {};// @Filename: b.tsimport {} from "./a";
```



If TypeScript determines that the runtime will perform a lookup for `./a.js` given the module specifier `"./a"`, then `./a.js` will undergo extension substitution , and resolve to the file `a.ts` in this example.

Extensionless relative paths are not supported in `import` paths in Node.js, and are not always supported in file paths specified in package.json files. TypeScript currently never supports omitting a `.mjs`/`.mts` or `.cjs`/`.cts` file extension, even though some runtimes and bundlers do.

#### Directory modules (index file resolution)

In some cases, a directory, rather than a file, can be referenced as a module. In the simplest and most common case, this involves the runtime or bundler looking for an `index.js` file in a directory. TypeScript supports this behavior where the `moduleResolution` setting and the context indicate that the runtime or bundler supports it:



```id
ts// @Filename: dir/index.tsexport {};// @Filename: b.tsimport {} from "./dir";
```



If TypeScript determines that the runtime will perform a lookup for `./dir/index.js` given the module specifier `"./dir"`, then `./dir/index.js` will undergo extension substitution , and resolve to the file `dir/index.ts` in this example.

Directory modules may also contain a package.json file, where resolution of the `"main"` and `"types"` fields are supported, and take precedence over `index.js` lookups. The `"typesVersions"` field is also supported in directory modules.

Note that directory modules are not the same as `node_modules` packages and only support a subset of the features available to packages, and are not supported at all in some contexts. Node.js considers them a legacy feature .

#### `paths`

 Overview 

TypeScript offers a way to override the compiler’s module resolution for bare specifiers with the `paths` compiler option. While the feature was originally designed to be used with the AMD module loader (a means of running modules in the browser before ESM existed or bundlers were widely used), it still has uses today when a runtime or bundler supports module resolution features that TypeScript does not model. For example, when running Node.js with `--experimental-network-imports`, you can manually specify a local type definition file for a specific `https://` import:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "nodenext",    "paths": {      "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21": ["./node_modules/@types/lodash/index.d.ts"]    }  }}
```




```id
ts// Typed by ./node_modules/@types/lodash/index.d.ts due to `paths` entryimport { add } from "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21";
```



It’s also common for apps built with bundlers to define convenience path aliases in their bundler configuration, and then inform TypeScript of those aliases with `paths`:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "esnext",    "moduleResolution": "bundler",    "paths": {      "@app/*": ["./src/*"]    }  }}
```


 `paths` does not affect emit 

The `paths` option does not change the import path in the code emitted by TypeScript. Consequently, it’s very easy to create path aliases that appear to work in TypeScript but will crash at runtime:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "nodenext",    "paths": {      "node-has-no-idea-what-this-is": ["./oops.ts"]    }  }}
```




```id
ts// TypeScript: ✅// Node.js: 💥import {} from "node-has-no-idea-what-this-is";
```



While it’s ok for bundled apps to set up `paths`, it’s very important that published libraries do not , since the emitted JavaScript will not work for consumers of the library without those users setting up the same aliases for both TypeScript and their bundler. Both libraries and apps can consider package.json `"imports"` as a standard replacement for convenience `paths` aliases.

 `paths` should not point to monorepo packages or node_modules packages 

While module specifiers that match `paths` aliases are bare specifiers, once the alias is resolved, module resolution proceeds on the resolved path as a relative path. Consequently, resolution features that happen for `node_modules` package lookups , including package.json `"exports"` field support, do not take effect when a `paths` alias is matched. This can lead to surprising behavior if `paths` is used to point to a `node_modules` package:



```id
ts{  "compilerOptions": {    "paths": {      "pkg": ["./node_modules/pkg/dist/index.d.ts"],      "pkg/*": ["./node_modules/pkg/*"]    }  }}
```



While this configuration may simulate some of the behavior of package resolution, it overrides any `main`, `types`, `exports`, and `typesVersions` the package’s `package.json` file defines, and imports from the package may fail at runtime.

The same caveat applies to packages referencing each other in a monorepo. Instead of using `paths` to make TypeScript artificially resolve `"@my-scope/lib"` to a sibling package, it’s best to use workspaces via npm , yarn , or pnpm to symlink your packages into `node_modules`, so both TypeScript and the runtime or bundler perform real `node_modules` package lookups. This is especially important if the monorepo packages will be published to npm—the packages will reference each other via `node_modules` package lookups once installed by users, and using workspaces allows you to test that behavior during local development.

 Relationship to `baseUrl` 

When `baseUrl` is provided, the values in each `paths` array are resolved relative to the `baseUrl`. Otherwise, they are resolved relative to the `tsconfig.json` file that defines them.

 Wildcard substitutions 

`paths` patterns can contain a single `*` wildcard, which matches any string. The `*` token can then be used in the file path values to substitute the matched string:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "paths": {      "@app/*": ["./src/*"]    }  }}
```



When resolving an import of `"@app/components/Button"`, TypeScript will match on `@app/*`, binding `*` to `components/Button`, and then attempt to resolve the path `./src/components/Button` relative to the `tsconfig.json` path. The remainder of this lookup will follow the same rules as any other relative path lookup according to the `moduleResolution` setting.

When multiple patterns match a module specifier, the pattern with the longest matching prefix before any `*` token is used:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "paths": {      "*": ["./src/foo/one.ts"],      "foo/*": ["./src/foo/two.ts"],      "foo/bar": ["./src/foo/three.ts"]    }  }}
```



When resolving an import of `"foo/bar"`, all three `paths` patterns match, but the last is used because `"foo/bar"` is longer than `"foo/"` and `""`.

 Fallbacks 

Multiple file paths can be provided for a path mapping. If resolution fails for one path, the next one in the array will be attempted until resolution succeeds or the end of the array is reached.



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "paths": {      "*": ["./vendor/*", "./types/*"]    }  }}
```



#### `baseUrl`

 

`baseUrl` was designed for use with AMD module loaders. If you aren’t using an AMD module loader, you probably shouldn’t use `baseUrl`. Since TypeScript 4.1, `baseUrl` is no longer required to use `paths` and should not be used just to set the directory `paths` values are resolved from.

 

The `baseUrl` compiler option can be combined with any `moduleResolution` mode and specifies a directory that bare specifiers (module specifiers that don’t begin with `./`, `../`, or `/`) are resolved from. `baseUrl` has a higher precedence than `node_modules` package lookups in `moduleResolution` modes that support them.

When performing a `baseUrl` lookup, resolution proceeds with the same rules as other relative path resolutions. For example, in a `moduleResolution` mode that supports extensionless relative paths a module specifier `"some-file"` may resolve to `/src/some-file.ts` if `baseUrl` is set to `/src`.

Resolution of relative module specifiers are never affected by the `baseUrl` option.

#### `node_modules` package lookups

Node.js treats module specifiers that aren’t relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs as references to packages that it looks up in `node_modules` subdirectories. Bundlers conveniently adopted this behavior to allow their users to use the same dependency management system, and often even the same dependencies, as they would in Node.js. All of TypeScript’s `moduleResolution` options except `classic` support `node_modules` lookups. (`classic` supports lookups in `node_modules/@types` when other means of resolution fail, but never looks for packages in `node_modules` directly.) Every `node_modules` package lookup has the following structure (beginning after higher precedence bare specifier rules, like `paths`, `baseUrl`, self-name imports, and package.json `"imports"` lookups have been exhausted):

- For each ancestor directory of the importing file, if a `node_modules` directory exists within it:

 If a directory with the same name as the package exists within `node_modules`:

 Attempt to resolve types from the package directory.

- If a result is found, return it and stop the search.

 
- If a directory with the same name as the package exists within `node_modules/@types`:

 Attempt to resolve types from the `@types` package directory.

- If a result is found, return it and stop the search.

 

 
- Repeat the previous search through all `node_modules` directories, but this time, allow JavaScript files as a result, and do not search in `@types` directories.

All `moduleResolution` modes (except `classic`) follow this pattern, while the details of how they resolve from a package directory, once located, differ, and are explained in the following sections.

#### package.json `"exports"`

When `moduleResolution` is set to `node16`, `nodenext`, or `bundler`, and `resolvePackageJsonExports` is not disabled, TypeScript follows Node.js’s package.json `"exports"` spec when resolving from a package directory triggered by a bare specifier `node_modules` package lookup .

TypeScript’s implementation for resolving a module specifier through `"exports"` to a file path follows Node.js exactly. Once a file path is resolved, however, TypeScript will still try multiple file extensions in order to prioritize finding types.

When resolving through conditional `"exports"` , TypeScript always matches the `"types"` and `"default"` conditions if present. Additionally, TypeScript will match a versioned types condition in the form `"types@{selector}"` (where `{selector}` is a `"typesVersions"`-compatible version selector) according to the same version-matching rules implemented in `"typesVersions"` . Other non-configurable conditions are dependent on the `moduleResolution` mode and specified in the following sections. Additional conditions can be configured to match with the `customConditions` compiler option.

Note that the presence of `"exports"` prevents any subpaths not explicitly listed or matched by a pattern in `"exports"` from being resolved.

 Example: subpaths, conditions, and extension substitution 

Scenario: `"pkg/subpath"` is requested with conditions `["types", "node", "require"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "exports": {    ".": {      "import": "./index.mjs",      "require": "./index.cjs"    },    "./subpath": {      "import": "./subpath/index.mjs",      "require": "./subpath/index.cjs"    }  }}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- Does `"exports"` have a `"./subpath"` entry? Yes. 

- The value at `exports["./subpath"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"import"` match this request? No. 

- Does the second condition `"require"` match this request? Yes. 

- Does the path `"./subpath/index.cjs"` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? No, so use extension substitution. 

- Via extension substitution , try the following paths, returning the first one that exists, or `undefined` otherwise:

 `./subpath/index.cts`

- `./subpath/index.d.cts`

- `./subpath/index.cjs`

 

If `./subpath/index.cts` or `./subpath.d.cts` exists, resolution is complete. Otherwise, resolution searches `node_modules/@types/pkg` and other `node_modules` directories in an attempt to resolve types, according to the `node_modules` package lookups rules. If no types are found, a second pass through all `node_modules` resolves to `./subpath/index.cjs` (assuming it exists), which counts as a successful resolution, but one that does not provide types, leading to `any`-typed imports and a `noImplicitAny` error if enabled.

 Example: explicit `"types"` condition 

Scenario: `"pkg/subpath"` is requested with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "exports": {    "./subpath": {      "import": {        "types": "./types/subpath/index.d.mts",        "default": "./es/subpath/index.mjs"      },      "require": {        "types": "./types/subpath/index.d.cts",        "default": "./cjs/subpath/index.cjs"      }    }  }}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- Does `"exports"` have a `"./subpath"` entry? Yes. 

- The value at `exports["./subpath"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"import"` match this request? Yes. 

- The value at `exports["./subpath"].import` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"types"` match this request? Yes. 

- Does the path `"./types/subpath/index.d.mts"` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `"./types/subpath/index.d.mts"` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

 Example: versioned `"types"` condition 

Scenario: using TypeScript 4.7.5, `"pkg/subpath"` is requested with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "exports": {    "./subpath": {      "types@>=5.2": "./ts5.2/subpath/index.d.ts",      "types@>=4.6": "./ts4.6/subpath/index.d.ts",      "types": "./tsold/subpath/index.d.ts",      "default": "./dist/subpath/index.js"    }  }}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- Does `"exports"` have a `"./subpath"` entry? Yes. 

- The value at `exports["./subpath"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"types@>=5.2"` match this request? No, 4.7.5 is not greater than or equal to 5.2. 

- Does the second condition `"types@>=4.6"` match this request? Yes, 4.7.5 is greater than or equal to 4.6. 

- Does the path `"./ts4.6/subpath/index.d.ts"` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `"./ts4.6/subpath/index.d.ts"` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

 Example: subpath patterns 

Scenario: `"pkg/wildcard.js"` is requested with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "type": "module",  "exports": {    "./*.js": {      "types": "./types/*.d.ts",      "default": "./dist/*.js"    }  }}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- Does `"exports"` have a `"./wildcard.js"` entry? No. 

- Does any key with a `*` in it match `"./wildcard.js"`? Yes, `"./*.js"` matches and sets `wildcard` to be the substitution. 

- The value at `exports["./*.js"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"types"` match this request? Yes. 

- In `./types/*.d.ts`, replace `*` with the substitution `wildcard`. `./types/wildcard.d.ts` 

- Does the path `"./types/wildcard.d.ts"` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `"./types/wildcard.d.ts"` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

 Example: `"exports"` block other subpaths 

Scenario: `"pkg/dist/index.js"` is requested in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "main": "./dist/index.js",  "exports": "./dist/index.js"}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- The value at `exports` is a string—it must be a file path for the package root (`"."`).

- Is the request `"pkg/dist/index.js"` for the package root? No, it has a subpath `dist/index.js`. 

- Resolution fails; return `undefined`.

Without `"exports"`, the request could have succeeded, but the presence of `"exports"` prevents resolving any subpaths that cannot be matched through `"exports"`.

#### package.json `"typesVersions"`

A `node_modules` package or directory module may specify a `"typesVersions"` field in its package.json to redirect TypeScript’s resolution process according to the TypeScript compiler version, and for `node_modules` packages, according to the subpath being resolved. This allows package authors to include new TypeScript syntax in one set of type definitions while providing another set for backward compatibility with older TypeScript versions (through a tool like downlevel-dts ). `"typesVersions"` is supported in all `moduleResolution` modes; however, the field is not read in situations when package.json `"exports"` are read.

 Example: redirect all requests to a subdirectory 

Scenario: a module imports `"pkg"` using TypeScript 5.2, where `node_modules/pkg/package.json` is:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "version": "1.0.0",  "types": "./index.d.ts",  "typesVersions": {    ">=3.1": {      "*": ["ts3.1/*"]    }  }}
```



Resolution process:

- (Depending on compiler options) Does `"exports"` exist? No. 

- Does `"typesVersions"` exist? Yes. 

- Is the TypeScript version `>=3.1`? Yes. Remember the mapping `"*": ["ts3.1/*"]`. 

- Are we resolving a subpath after the package name? No, just the root `"pkg"`. 

- Does `"types"` exist? Yes. 

- Does any key in `"typesVersions"` match `./index.d.ts`? Yes, `"*"` matches and sets `index.d.ts` to be the substitution. 

- In `ts3.1/*`, replace `*` with the substitution `./index.d.ts`: `ts3.1/index.d.ts` .

- Does the path `./ts3.1/index.d.ts` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `./ts3.1/index.d.ts` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

 Example: redirect requests for a specific file 

Scenario: a module imports `"pkg"` using TypeScript 3.9, where `node_modules/pkg/package.json` is:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "version": "1.0.0",  "types": "./index.d.ts",  "typesVersions": {    "<4.0": { "index.d.ts": ["index.v3.d.ts"] }  }}
```



Resolution process:

- (Depending on compiler options) Does `"exports"` exist? No. 

- Does `"typesVersions"` exist? Yes. 

- Is the TypeScript version ` Yes. Remember the mapping `"index.d.ts": ["index.v3.d.ts"]`. 

- Are we resolving a subpath after the package name? No, just the root `"pkg"`. 

- Does `"types"` exist? Yes. 

- Does any key in `"typesVersions"` match `./index.d.ts`? Yes, `"index.d.ts"` matches. 

- Does the path `./index.v3.d.ts` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `./index.v3.d.ts` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

#### package.json `"main"` and `"types"`

If a directory’s package.json `"exports"` field is not read (either due to compiler options, or because it is not present, or because the directory is being resolved as a directory module instead of a `node_modules` package ) and the module specifier does not have a subpath after the package name or package.json-containing directory, TypeScript will attempt to resolve from these package.json fields, in order, in an attempt to find the main module for the package or directory:

- `"types"`

- `"typings"` (legacy)

- `"main"`

The declaration file found at `"types"` is assumed to be an accurate representation of the implementation file found at `"main"`. If `"types"` and `"typings"` are not present or cannot be resolved, TypeScript will read the `"main"` field and perform extension substitution to find a declaration file.

When publishing a typed package to npm, it’s recommended to include a `"types"` field even if extension substitution or package.json `"exports"` make it unnecessary, because npm shows a TS icon on the package registry listing only if the package.json contains a `"types"` field.

#### Package-relative file paths

If neither package.json `"exports"` nor package.json `"typesVersions"` apply, subpaths of a bare package specifier resolve relative to the package directory, according to applicable relative path resolution rules. In modes that respect [package.json `"exports"`], this behavior is blocked by the mere presence of the `"exports"` field in the package’s package.json, even if the import fails to resolve through `"exports"`, as demonstrated in an example above . On the other hand, if the import fails to resolve through `"typesVersions"`, a package-relative file path resolution is attempted as a fallback.

When package-relative paths are supported, they resolve under the same rules as any other relative path considering the `moduleResolution` mode and context. For example, in `--moduleResolution nodenext` , directory modules and extensionless paths are only supported in `require` calls, not in `import`s:



```id
ts// @Filename: module.mtsimport "pkg/dist/foo";                // ❌ import, needs `.js` extensionimport "pkg/dist/foo.js";             // ✅import foo = require("pkg/dist/foo"); // ✅ require, no extension needed
```



#### package.json `"imports"` and self-name imports

When `moduleResolution` is set to `node16`, `nodenext`, or `bundler`, and `resolvePackageJsonImports` is not disabled, TypeScript will attempt to resolve import paths beginning with `#` through the `"imports"` field of the nearest ancestor package.json of the importing file. Similarly, when package.json `"exports"` lookups are enabled, TypeScript will attempt to resolve import paths beginning with the current package name—that is, the value in the `"name"` field of the nearest ancestor package.json of the importing file—through the `"exports"` field of that package.json. Both of these features allow files in a package to import other files in the same package, replacing a relative import path.

TypeScript follows Node.js’s resolution algorithm for `"imports"` and self references exactly up until a file path is resolved. At that point, TypeScript’s resolution algorithm forks based on whether the package.json containing the `"imports"` or `"exports"` being resolved belongs to a `node_modules` dependency or the local project being compiled (i.e., its directory contains the tsconfig.json file for the project that contains the importing file):

- If the package.json is in `node_modules`, TypeScript will apply extension substitution to the file path if it doesn’t already have a recognized TypeScript file extension, and check for the existence of the resulting file paths.

- If the package.json is part of the local project, an additional remapping step is performed in order to find the input TypeScript implementation file that will eventually produce the output JavaScript or declaration file path that was resolved from `"imports"`. Without this step, any compilation that resolves an `"imports"` path would be referencing output files from the previous compilation instead of other input files that are intended to be included in the current compilation. This remapping uses the `outDir`/`declarationDir` and `rootDir` from the tsconfig.json, so using `"imports"` usually requires an explicit `rootDir` to be set.

This variation allows package authors to write `"imports"` and `"exports"` fields that reference only the compilation outputs that will be published to npm, while still allowing local development to use the original TypeScript source files.

 Example: local project with conditions 

Scenario: `"/src/main.mts"` imports `"#utils"` with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a project directory with a tsconfig.json and package.json:



```id
json// tsconfig.json{  "compilerOptions": {    "moduleResolution": "node16",    "resolvePackageJsonImports": true,    "rootDir": "./src",    "outDir": "./dist"  }}
```




```id
json// package.json{  "name": "pkg",  "imports": {    "#utils": {      "import": "./dist/utils.d.mts",      "require": "./dist/utils.d.cts"    }  }}
```



Resolution process:

- Import path starts with `#`, try to resolve through `"imports"`.

- Does `"imports"` exist in the nearest ancestor package.json? Yes. 

- Does `"#utils"` exist in the `"imports"` object? Yes. 

- The value at `imports["#utils"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"import"` match this request? Yes. 

- Should we attempt to map the output path to an input path? Yes, because: 

 Is the package.json in `node_modules`? No, it’s in the local project. 

- Is the tsconfig.json within the package.json directory? Yes. 

 
- In `./dist/utils.d.mts`, replace the `outDir` prefix with `rootDir`. `./src/utils.d.mts` 

- Replace the output extension `.d.mts` with the corresponding input extension `.mts`. `./src/utils.mts` 

- Return the path `"./src/utils.mts"` if the file exists.

- Otherwise, return the path `"./dist/utils.d.mts"` if the file exists.

 Example: `node_modules` dependency with subpath pattern 

Scenario: `"/node_modules/pkg/main.mts"` imports `"#internal/utils"` with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) with the package.json:



```id
json// /node_modules/pkg/package.json{  "name": "pkg",  "imports": {    "#internal/*": {      "import": "./dist/internal/*.mjs",      "require": "./dist/internal/*.cjs"    }  }}
```



Resolution process:

- Import path starts with `#`, try to resolve through `"imports"`.

- Does `"imports"` exist in the nearest ancestor package.json? Yes. 

- Does `"#internal/utils"` exist in the `"imports"` object? No, check for pattern matches. 

- Does any key with a `*` match `"#internal/utils"`? Yes, `"#internal/*"` matches and sets `utils` to be the substitution. 

- The value at `imports["#internal/*"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"import"` match this request? Yes. 

- Should we attempt to map the output path to an input path? No, because the package.json is in `node_modules`. 

- In `./dist/internal/*.mjs`, replace `*` with the substitution `utils`. `./dist/internal/utils.mjs` 

- Does the path `./dist/internal/utils.mjs` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? No, try extension substitution. 

- Via extension substitution , try the following paths, returning the first one that exists, or `undefined` otherwise:

 `./dist/internal/utils.mts`

- `./dist/internal/utils.d.mts`

- `./dist/internal/utils.mjs`

 

### `node16`, `nodenext`

These modes reflect the module resolution behavior of Node.js v12 and later. (`node16` and `nodenext` are currently identical, but if Node.js makes significant changes to its module system in the future, `node16` will be frozen while `nodenext` will be updated to reflect the new behavior.) In Node.js, the resolution algorithm for ECMAScript imports is significantly different from the algorithm for CommonJS `require` calls. For each module specifier being resolved, the syntax and the module format of the importing file are first used to determine whether the module specifier will be in an `import` or `require` in the emitted JavaScript. That information is then passed into the module resolver to determine which resolution algorithm to use (and whether to use the `"import"` or `"require"` condition for package.json `"exports"` or `"imports"` ).

 

TypeScript files that are determined to be in CommonJS format may still use `import` and `export` syntax by default, but the emitted JavaScript will use `require` and `module.exports` instead. This means that it’s common to see `import` statements that are resolved using the `require` algorithm. If this causes confusion, the `verbatimModuleSyntax` compiler option can be enabled, which prohibits the use of `import` statements that would be emitted as `require` calls.

 

Note that dynamic `import()` calls are always resolved using the `import` algorithm, according to Node.js’s behavior. However, `import()` types are resolved according to the format of the importing file (for backward compatibility with existing CommonJS-format type declarations):



```id
ts// @Filename: module.mtsimport x from "./mod.js";             // `import` algorithm due to file format (emitted as-written)import("./mod.js");                   // `import` algorithm due to syntax (emitted as-written)type Mod = typeof import("./mod.js"); // `import` algorithm due to file formatimport mod = require("./mod");        // `require` algorithm due to syntax (emitted as `require`)// @Filename: commonjs.ctsimport x from "./mod";                // `require` algorithm due to file format (emitted as `require`)import("./mod.js");                   // `import` algorithm due to syntax (emitted as-written)type Mod = typeof import("./mod");    // `require` algorithm due to file formatimport mod = require("./mod");        // `require` algorithm due to syntax (emitted as `require`)
```

### `bundler`

`--moduleResolution bundler` attempts to model the module resolution behavior common to most JavaScript bundlers. In short, this means supporting all the behaviors traditionally associated with Node.js’s CommonJS `require` resolution algorithm like `node_modules` lookups , directory modules , and extensionless paths , while also supporting newer Node.js resolution features like package.json `"exports"` and package.json `"imports"` .

It’s instructive to think about the similarities and differences between `--moduleResolution bundler` and `--moduleResolution nodenext`, particularly in how they decide what conditions to use when resolving package.json `"exports"` or `"imports"`. Consider an import statement in a `.ts` file:



```id
ts// index.tsimport { foo } from "pkg";
```



Recall that in `--module nodenext --moduleResolution nodenext`, the `--module` setting first determines whether the import will be emitted to the `.js` file as an `import` or `require` call, then passes that information to TypeScript’s module resolver, which decides whether to match `"import"` or `"require"` conditions in `"pkg"`’s package.json `"exports"` accordingly. Let’s assume that there’s no package.json in scope of this file. The file extension is `.ts`, so the output file extension will be `.js`, which Node.js will interpret as CommonJS, so TypeScript will emit this `import` as a `require` call. So, the module resolver will use the `require` condition as it resolves `"exports"` from `"pkg"`.

The same process happens in `--moduleResolution bundler`, but the rules for deciding whether to emit an `import` or `require` call for this import statement will be different, since `--moduleResolution bundler` necessitates using `--module esnext` or `--module preserve` . In both of those modes, ESM `import` declarations always emit as ESM `import` declarations, so TypeScript’s module resolver will receive that information and use the `"import"` condition as it resolves `"exports"` from `"pkg"`.

This explanation may be somewhat unintuitive, since `--moduleResolution bundler` is usually used in combination with `--noEmit`—bundlers typically process raw `.ts` files and perform module resolution on untransformed `import`s or `require`s. However, for consistency, TypeScript still uses the hypothetical emit decided by `module` to inform module resolution and type checking. This makes `--module preserve` the best choice whenever a runtime or bundler is operating on raw `.ts` files, since it implies no transformation. Under `--module preserve --moduleResolution bundler`, you can write imports and requires in the same file that will resolve with the `import` and `require` conditions, respectively:



```id
ts// index.tsimport pkg1 from "pkg";       // Resolved with "import" conditionimport pkg2 = require("pkg"); // Resolved with "require" condition
```



#### Implied and enforced options

# Modules - ESM/CJS Interoperability

 

It’s 2015, and you’re writing an ESM-to-CJS transpiler. There’s no specification for how to do this; all you have is a specification of how ES modules are supposed to interact with each other, knowledge of how CommonJS modules interact with each other, and a knack for figuring things out. Consider an exporting ES module:



```id
tsexport const A = {};export const B = {};export default "Hello, world!";
```



How would you turn this into a CommonJS module? Recalling that default exports are just named exports with special syntax, there seems to be only one choice:



```id
tsexports.A = {};exports.B = {};exports.default = "Hello, world!";
```



This is a nice analog, and it lets you implement a similar on the importing side:



```id
tsimport hello, { A, B } from "./module";console.log(hello, A, B);// transpiles to:const module_1 = require("./module");console.log(module_1.default, module_1.A, module_1.B);
```



So far, everything in CJS-world matches up one-to-one with everything in ESM-world. Extending the equivalence above one step further, we can see that we also have:



```id
tsimport * as mod from "./module";console.log(mod.default, mod.A, mod.B);// transpiles to:const mod = require("./module");console.log(mod.default, mod.A, mod.B);
```



You might notice that in this scheme, there’s no way to write an ESM export that produces an output where `exports` is assigned a function, class, or primitive:



```id
ts// @Filename: exports-function.jsmodule.exports = function hello() {  console.log("Hello, world!");};
```



But existing CommonJS modules frequently take this form. How might an ESM import, processed with our transpiler, access this module? We just established that a namespace import (`import *`) transpiles to a plain `require` call, so we can support an input like:



```id
tsimport * as hello from "./exports-function";hello();// transpiles to:const hello = require("./exports-function");hello();
```



Our output works at runtime, but we have a compliance problem: according to the JavaScript specification, a namespace import always resolves to a Module Namespace Object , that is, an object whose members are the exports of the module. In this case, `require` would return the function `hello`, but `import *` can never return a function. The correspondence we assumed appears invalid.

It’s worth taking a step back here and clarifying what the goal is. As soon as modules landed in the ES2015 specification, transpilers emerged with support for downleveling ESM to CJS, allowing users to adopt the new syntax long before runtimes implemented support for it. There was even a sense that writing ESM code was a good way to “future-proof” new projects. For this to be true, there needed to be a seamless migration path from executing the transpilers’ CJS output to executing the ESM input natively once runtimes developed support for it. The goal was to find a way to downlevel ESM to CJS that would allow any or all of those transpiled outputs to be replaced by their true ESM inputs in a future runtime, with no observable change in behavior.

By following the specification, it was easy enough for transpilers to find a set of transformations that made the semantics of their transpiled CommonJS outputs match the specified semantics of their ESM inputs (arrows represent imports):

 

However, CommonJS modules (written as CommonJS, not as ESM transpiled to CommonJS) were already well-established in the Node.js ecosystem, so it was inevitable that modules written as ESM and transpiled to CJS would start “importing” modules written as CommonJS. The behavior for this interoperability, though, was not specified by ES2015, and didn’t yet exist in any real runtime.

 

Even if transpiler authors did nothing, a behavior would emerge from the existing semantics between the `require` calls they emitted in transpiled code and the `exports` defined in existing CJS modules. And to allow users to transition seamlessly from transpiled ESM to true ESM once their runtime supported it, that behavior would have to match the one the runtime chose to implement.

Guessing what interop behavior runtimes would support wasn’t limited to ESM importing “true CJS” modules either. Whether ESM would be able to recognize ESM-transpiled-from-CJS as distinct from CJS, and whether CJS would be able to `require` ES modules, were also unspecified. Even whether ESM imports would use the same module resolution algorithm as CJS `require` calls was unknowable. All these variables would have to be predicted correctly in order to give transpiler users a seamless migration path toward native ESM.

## `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` and `esModuleInterop`

Let’s return to our specification compliance problem, where `import *` transpiles to `require`:



```id
ts// Invalid according to the spec:import * as hello from "./exports-function";hello();// but the transpilation works:const hello = require("./exports-function");hello();
```



When TypeScript first added support for writing and transpiling ES modules, the compiler addressed this problem by issuing an error on any namespace import of a module whose `exports` was not a namespace-like object:



```id
tsimport * as hello from "./exports-function";// TS2497              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^// External module '"./exports-function"' resolves to a non-module entity// and cannot be imported using this construct.
```



The only workaround was for users to go back to using the older TypeScript import syntax representing a CommonJS `require`:



```id
tsimport hello = require("./exports-function");
```



Forcing users to revert to non-ESM syntax was essentially an admission that “we don’t know how or if a CJS module like `"./exports-function"` will be accessible with ESM imports in the future, but we know it can’t be with `import *`, even though it will work at runtime in the transpilation scheme we’re using.” It doesn’t meet the goal of allowing this file to be migrated to real ESM without changes, but neither does the alternative of allowing the `import *` to link to a function. This is still the behavior in TypeScript today when `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` and `esModuleInterop` are disabled.

 

Unfortunately, this is a slight oversimplification—TypeScript didn’t fully avoid the compliance issue with this error, because it allowed namespace imports of functions to work, and retain their call signatures, as long as the function declaration merged with a namespace declaration—even if the namespace was empty. So while a module exporting a bare function was recognized as a “non-module entity”:



```id
tsdeclare function $(selector: string): any;export = $; // Cannot `import *` this 👍
```



A should-be-meaningless change allowed the invalid import to type check without errors:



```id
tsdeclare namespace $ {}declare function $(selector: string): any;export = $; // Allowed to `import *` this and call it 😱
```


 

Meanwhile, other transpilers were coming up with a way to solve the same problem. The thought process went something like this:

 To import a CJS module that exports a function or a primitive, we clearly need to use a default import. A namespace import would be illegal, and named imports don’t make sense here.

- Most likely, this means that runtimes implementing ESM/CJS interop will choose to make default imports of CJS modules always link directly to the whole `exports`, rather than only doing so if the `exports` is a function or primitive.

- So, a default import of a true CJS module should work just like a `require` call. But we’ll need a way to disambiguate true CJS modules from our transpiled CJS modules, so we can still transpile `export default "hello"` to `exports.default = "hello"` and have a default import of that module link to `exports.default`. Basically, a default import of one of our own transpiled modules needs to work one way (to simulate ESM-to-ESM imports), while a default import of any other existing CJS module needs to work another way (to simulate how we think ESM-to-CJS imports will work).

- When we transpile an ES module to CJS, let’s add a special extra field to the output:


```id
tsexports.A = {};exports.B = {};exports.default = "Hello, world!";// Extra special flag!exports.__esModule = true;
```


that we can check for when we transpile a default import:


```id
ts// import hello from "./module";const _mod = require("./module");const hello = _mod.__esModule ? _mod.default : _mod;
```



The `__esModule` flag first appeared in Traceur, then in Babel, SystemJS, and Webpack shortly after. TypeScript added the `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` in 1.8 to allow the type checker to link default imports directly to the `exports`, rather than the `exports.default`, of any module types that lacked an `export default` declaration. The flag didn’t modify how imports or exports were emitted, but it allowed default imports to reflect how other transpilers would treat them. Namely, it allowed a default import to be used to resolve to “non-module entities,” where `import *` was an error:



```id
ts// Error:import * as hello from "./exports-function";// Old workaround:import hello = require("./exports-function");// New way, with `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`:import hello from "./exports-function";
```



This was usually enough to let Babel and Webpack users write code that already worked in those systems without TypeScript complaining, but it was only a partial solution, leaving a few issues unsolved:

- Babel and others varied their default import behavior on whether an `__esModule` property was found on the target module, but `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` only enabled a fallback behavior when no default export was found in the target module’s types. This created an inconsistency if the target module had an `__esModule` flag but no default export. Transpilers and bundlers would still link a default import of such a module to its `exports.default`, which would be `undefined`, and would ideally be an error in TypeScript, since real ESM imports cause errors if they can’t be linked. But with `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`, TypeScript would think a default import of such an import links to the whole `exports` object, allowing named exports to be accessed as its properties.

- `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` didn’t change how namespace imports were typed, creating an odd inconsistency where both could be used and would have the same type:


```id
ts// @Filename: exportEqualsObject.d.tsdeclare const obj: object;export = obj;// @Filename: main.tsimport objDefault from "./exportEqualsObject";import * as objNamespace from "./exportEqualsObject";// This should be true at runtime, but TypeScript gives an error:objNamespace.default === objDefault;//           ^^^^^^^ Property 'default' does not exist on type 'typeof import("./exportEqualsObject")'.
```



- Most importantly, `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` did not change the JavaScript emitted by `tsc`. So while the flag enabled more accurate checking as long as the code was fed into another tool like Babel or Webpack, it created a real danger for users who were emitting `--module commonjs` with `tsc` and running in Node.js. If they encountered an error with `import *`, it may have appeared as if enabling `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` would fix it, but in fact it only silenced the build-time error while emitting code that would crash in Node.

TypeScript introduced the `esModuleInterop` flag in 2.7, which refined the type checking of imports to address the remaining inconsistencies between TypeScript’s analysis and the interop behavior used in existing transpilers and bundlers, and critically, adopted the same `__esModule`-conditional CommonJS emit that transpilers had adopted years before. (Another new emit helper for `import *` ensured the result was always an object, with call signatures stripped, fully resolving the specification compliance issue that the aforementioned “resolves to a non-module entity” error didn’t quite sidestep.) Finally, with the new flag enabled, TypeScript’s type checking, TypeScript’s emit, and the rest of the transpiling and bundling ecosystem were in agreement on a CJS/ESM interop scheme that was spec-legal and, perhaps, plausibly adoptable by Node.

## Interop in Node.js

Node.js shipped support for ES modules unflagged in v12. Like the bundlers and transpilers began doing years before, Node.js gave CommonJS modules a “synthetic default export” of their `exports` object, allowing the entire module contents to be accessed with a default import from ESM:



```id
ts// @Filename: export.cjsmodule.exports = { hello: "world" };// @Filename: import.mjsimport greeting from "./export.cjs";greeting.hello; // "world"
```



That’s one win for seamless migration! Unfortunately, the similarities mostly end there.

### No `__esModule` detection (the “double default” problem)

Node.js wasn’t able to respect the `__esModule` marker to vary its default import behavior. So a transpiled module with a “default export” behaves one way when “imported” by another transpiled module, and another way when imported by a true ES module in Node.js:



```id
ts// @Filename: node_modules/dependency/index.jsexports.__esModule = true;exports.default = function doSomething() { /*...*/ }// @Filename: transpile-vs-run-directly.{js/mjs}import doSomething from "dependency";// Works after transpilation, but not a function in Node.js ESM:doSomething();// Doesn't exist after transpilation, but works in Node.js ESM:doSomething.default();
```



While the transpiled default import only makes the synthetic default export if the target module lacks an `__esModule` flag, Node.js always synthesizes a default export, creating a “double default” on the transpiled module.

### Unreliable named exports

In addition to making a CommonJS module’s `exports` object available as a default import, Node.js attempts to find properties of `exports` to make available as named imports. This behavior matches bundlers and transpilers when it works; however, Node.js uses syntactic analysis to synthesize named exports before any code executes, whereas transpiled modules resolve their named imports at runtime. The result is that imports from CJS modules that work in transpiled modules may not work in Node.js:



```id
ts// @Filename: named-exports.cjsexports.hello = "world";exports["worl" + "d"] = "hello";// @Filename: transpile-vs-run-directly.{js/mjs}import { hello, world } from "./named-exports.cjs";// `hello` works, but `world` is missing in Node.js 💥import mod from "./named-exports.cjs";mod.world;// Accessing properties from the default always works ✅
```



### Cannot `require` a true ES module before Node.js v22

True CommonJS modules can `require` an ESM-transpiled-to-CJS module, since they’re both CommonJS at runtime. But in Node.js versions older than v22.12.0, `require` crashes if it resolves to an ES module. This means published libraries cannot migrate from transpiled modules to true ESM without breaking their CommonJS (true or transpiled) consumers:



```id
ts// @Filename: node_modules/dependency/index.jsexport function doSomething() { /* ... */ }// @Filename: dependent.jsimport { doSomething } from "dependency";// ✅ Works if dependent and dependency are both transpiled// ✅ Works if dependent and dependency are both true ESM// ✅ Works if dependent is true ESM and dependency is transpiled// 💥 Crashes if dependent is transpiled and dependency is true ESM

### Different module resolution algorithms

Node.js introduced a new module resolution algorithm for resolving ESM imports that differed significantly from the long-standing algorithm for resolving `require` calls. While not directly related to interop between CJS and ES modules, this difference was one more reason why a seamless migration from transpiled modules to true ESM might not be possible:



```id
ts// @Filename: add.jsexport function add(a, b) {  return a + b;}// @Filename: math.jsexport * from "./add";//            ^^^^^^^// Works when transpiled to CJS,// but would have to be "./add.js"// in Node.js ESM.
```



## Conclusions

Clearly, a seamless migration from transpiled modules to ESM isn’t possible, at least in Node.js. Where does this leave us?

### Setting the right `module` compiler option is critical

Since interoperability rules differ between hosts, TypeScript can’t offer correct checking behavior unless it understands what kind of module is represented by each file it sees, and what set of rules to apply to them. This is the purpose of the `module` compiler option. (In particular, code that is intended to run in Node.js is subject to stricter rules than code that will be processed by a bundler. The compiler’s output is not checked for Node.js compatibility unless `module` is set to `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext`.)

### Applications with CommonJS code should always enable `esModuleInterop`

In a TypeScript application (as opposed to a library that others may consume) where `tsc` is used to emit JavaScript files, whether `esModuleInterop` is enabled doesn’t have major consequences. The way you write imports for certain kinds of modules will change, but TypeScript’s checking and emit are in sync, so error-free code should be safe to run in either mode. The downside of leaving `esModuleInterop` disabled in this case is that it allows you to write JavaScript code with semantics that clearly violate the ECMAScript specification, confusing intuitions about namespace imports and making it harder to migrate to running ES modules in the future.

In an application that gets processed by a third-party transpiler or bundler, on the other hand, enabling `esModuleInterop` is more important. All major bundlers and transpilers use an `esModuleInterop`-like emit strategy, so TypeScript needs to adjust its checking to match. (The compiler always reasons about what will happen in the JavaScript files that `tsc` would emit, so even if another tool is being used in place of `tsc`, emit-affecting compiler options should still be set to match the output of that tool as closely as possible.)

`allowSyntheticDefaultImports` without `esModuleInterop` should be avoided. It changes the compiler’s checking behavior without changing the code emitted by `tsc`, allowing potentially unsafe JavaScript to be emitted. Additionally, the checking changes it introduces are an incomplete version of the ones introduced by `esModuleInterop`. Even if `tsc` isn’t being used for emit, it’s better to enable `esModuleInterop` than `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`.

Some people object to the inclusion of the `__importDefault` and `__importStar` helper functions included in `tsc`’s JavaScript output when `esModuleInterop` is enabled, either because it marginally increases the output size on disk or because the interop algorithm employed by the helpers seems to misrepresent Node.js’s interop behavior by checking for `__esModule`, leading to the hazards discussed earlier. Both of these objections can be addressed, at least partially, without accepting the flawed checking behavior exhibited with `esModuleInterop` disabled. First, the `importHelpers` compiler option can be used to import the helper functions from `tslib` rather than inlining them into each file that needs them. To discuss the second objection, let’s look at a final example:



```id
ts// @Filename: node_modules/transpiled-dependency/index.jsexports.__esModule = true;exports.default = function doSomething() { /* ... */ };exports.something = "something";// @Filename: node_modules/true-cjs-dependency/index.jsmodule.exports = function doSomethingElse() { /* ... */ };// @Filename: src/sayHello.tsexport default function sayHello() { /* ... */ }export const hello = "hello";// @Filename: src/main.tsimport doSomething from "transpiled-dependency";import doSomethingElse from "true-cjs-dependency";import sayHello from "./sayHello.js";
```



Assume we’re compiling `src` to CommonJS for use in Node.js. Without `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` or `esModuleInterop`, the import of `doSomethingElse` from `"true-cjs-dependency"` is an error, and the others are not. To fix the error without changing any compiler options, you could change the import to 

```
import doSomethingElse = require("true-cjs-dependency")
```

. However, depending on how the types for the module (not shown) are written, you may also be able to write and call a namespace import, which would be a language-level specification violation. With `esModuleInterop`, none of the imports shown are errors (and all are callable), but the invalid namespace import would be caught.

What would change if we decided to migrate `src` to true ESM in Node.js (say, add `"type": "module"` to our root package.json)? The first import, `doSomething` from `"transpiled-dependency"`, would no longer be callable—it exhibits the “double default” problem, where we’d have to call `doSomething.default()` rather than `doSomething()`. (TypeScript understands and catches this under `--module node16`—`nodenext`.) But notably, the second import of `doSomethingElse`, which needed `esModuleInterop` to work when compiling to CommonJS, works fine in true ESM.

If there’s something to complain about here, it’s not what `esModuleInterop` does with the second import. The changes it makes, both allowing the default import and preventing callable namespace imports, are exactly in line with Node.js’s real ESM/CJS interop strategy, and made migration to real ESM easier. The problem, if there is one, is that `esModuleInterop` seems to fail at giving us a seamless migration path for the first import. But this problem was not introduced by enabling `esModuleInterop`; the first import was completely unaffected by it. Unfortunately, this problem cannot be solved without breaking the semantic contract between `main.ts` and `sayHello.ts`, because the CommonJS output of `sayHello.ts` looks structurally identical to `transpiled-dependency/index.js`. If `esModuleInterop` changed the way the transpiled import of `doSomething` works to be identical to the way it would work in Node.js ESM, it would change the behavior of the `sayHello` import in the same way, making the input code violate ESM semantics (thus still preventing the `src` directory from being migrated to ESM without changes).

As we’ve seen, there is no seamless migration path from transpiled modules to true ESM. But `esModuleInterop` is one step in the right direction. For those who still prefer to minimize module syntax transformations and the inclusion of the import helper functions, enabling `verbatimModuleSyntax` is a better choice than disabling `esModuleInterop`. `verbatimModuleSyntax` enforces that the `import mod = require("mod")` and `export = ns` syntax be used in CommonJS-emitting files, avoiding all the kinds of import ambiguity we’ve discussed, at the cost of ease of migration to true ESM.

### Library code needs special considerations

Libraries that ship as CommonJS should avoid using default exports, since the way those transpiled exports can be accessed varies between different tools and runtimes, and some of those ways will look confusing to users. A default export, transpiled to CommonJS by `tsc`, is accessible in Node.js as the default property of a default import:



```id
jsimport pkg from "pkg";pkg.default();
```



in most bundlers or transpiled ESM as the default import itself:



```id
jsimport pkg from "pkg";pkg();
```



and in vanilla CommonJS as the default property of a `require` call:



```id
jsconst pkg = require("pkg");pkg.default();
```



Users will detect a misconfigured module smell if they have to access the `.default` property of a default import, and if they’re trying to write code that will run both in Node.js and a bundler, they might be stuck. Some third-party TypeScript transpilers expose options that change the way default exports are emitted to mitigate this difference, but they don’t produce their own declaration (`.d.ts`) files, so that creates a mismatch between the runtime behavior and the type checking, further confusing and frustrating users. Instead of using default exports, libraries that need to ship as CommonJS should use `export =` for modules that have a single main export, or named exports for modules that have multiple exports:



```id
diff- export default function doSomething() { /* ... */ }+ export = function doSomething() { /* ... */ }
```



Libraries (that ship declaration files) should also take extra care to ensure the types they write are error-free under a wide range of compiler options. For example, it’s possible to write one interface that extends another in such a way that it only compiles successfully when `strictNullChecks` is disabled. If a library were to publish types like that, it would force all their users to disable `strictNullChecks` too. `esModuleInterop` can allow type declarations to contain similarly “infectious” default imports:



```id
ts// @Filename: /node_modules/dependency/index.d.tsimport express from "express";declare function doSomething(req: express.Request): any;export = doSomething;
```



Suppose this default import only works with `esModuleInterop` enabled, and causes an error when a user without that option references this file. The user should probably enable `esModuleInterop` anyway, but it’s generally seen as bad form for libraries to make their configurations infectious like this. It would be much better for the library to ship a declaration file like:



```id
tsimport express = require("express");// ...
```



Examples like this have led to conventional wisdom that says libraries should not enable `esModuleInterop`. This advice is a reasonable start, but we’ve looked at examples where the type of a namespace import changes, potentially introducing an error, when enabling `esModuleInterop`. So whether libraries compile with or without `esModuleInterop`, they run the risk of writing syntax that makes their choice infectious.

Library authors who want to go above and beyond to ensure maximum compatibility would do well to validate their declaration files against a matrix of compiler options. But using `verbatimModuleSyntax` completely sidesteps the issue with `esModuleInterop` by forcing CommonJS-emitting files to use CommonJS-style import and export syntax. Additionally, since `esModuleInterop` only affects CommonJS, as more libraries move to ESM-only publishing over time, the relevance of this issue will decline.

# Type Compatibility

 

Type compatibility in TypeScript is based on structural subtyping.
Structural typing is a way of relating types based solely on their members.
This is in contrast with nominal typing.
Consider the following code:



```id
tsinterface Pet {  name: string;}class Dog {  name: string;}let pet: Pet;// OK, because of structural typingpet = new Dog();
```



In nominally-typed languages like C# or Java, the equivalent code would be an error because the `Dog` class does not explicitly describe itself as being an implementer of the `Pet` interface.

TypeScript’s structural type system was designed based on how JavaScript code is typically written.
Because JavaScript widely uses anonymous objects like function expressions and object literals, it’s much more natural to represent the kinds of relationships found in JavaScript libraries with a structural type system instead of a nominal one.

## A Note on Soundness

TypeScript’s type system allows certain operations that can’t be known at compile-time to be safe. When a type system has this property, it is said to not be “sound”. The places where TypeScript allows unsound behavior were carefully considered, and throughout this document we’ll explain where these happen and the motivating scenarios behind them.

## Starting out

The basic rule for TypeScript’s structural type system is that `x` is compatible with `y` if `y` has at least the same members as `x`. For example consider the following code involving an interface named `Pet` which has a `name` property:



```id
tsinterface Pet {  name: string;}let pet: Pet;// dog's inferred type is { name: string; owner: string; }let dog = { name: "Lassie", owner: "Rudd Weatherwax" };pet = dog;
```



To check whether `dog` can be assigned to `pet`, the compiler checks each property of `pet` to find a corresponding compatible property in `dog`.
In this case, `dog` must have a member called `name` that is a string. It does, so the assignment is allowed.

The same rule for assignment is used when checking function call arguments:



```id
tsinterface Pet {  name: string;}let dog = { name: "Lassie", owner: "Rudd Weatherwax" };function greet(pet: Pet) {  console.log("Hello, " + pet.name);}greet(dog); // OK
```



Note that `dog` has an extra `owner` property, but this does not create an error.
Only members of the target type (`Pet` in this case) are considered when
checking for compatibility. This comparison process proceeds recursively,
exploring the type of each member and sub-member.

Be aware, however, that object literals may only specify known properties .
For example, because we have explicitly specified that `dog` is
of type `Pet`, the following code is invalid:



```id
tslet dog: Pet = { name: "Lassie", owner: "Rudd Weatherwax" }; // Error
```



## Comparing two functions

While comparing primitive types and object types is relatively straightforward, the question of what kinds of functions should be considered compatible is a bit more involved.
Let’s start with a basic example of two functions that differ only in their parameter lists:



```id
tslet x = (a: number) => 0;let y = (b: number, s: string) => 0;y = x; // OKx = y; // Error
```



To check if `x` is assignable to `y`, we first look at the parameter list.
Each parameter in `x` must have a corresponding parameter in `y` with a compatible type.
Note that the names of the parameters are not considered, only their types.
In this case, every parameter of `x` has a corresponding compatible parameter in `y`, so the assignment is allowed.

The second assignment is an error, because `y` has a required second parameter that `x` does not have, so the assignment is disallowed.

You may be wondering why we allow ‘discarding’ parameters like in the example `y = x`.
The reason for this assignment to be allowed is that ignoring extra function parameters is actually quite common in JavaScript.
For example, `Array#forEach` provides three parameters to the callback function: the array element, its index, and the containing array.
Nevertheless, it’s very useful to provide a callback that only uses the first parameter:



```id
tslet items = [1, 2, 3];// Don't force these extra parametersitems.forEach((item, index, array) => console.log(item));// Should be OK!items.forEach((item) => console.log(item));
```



Now let’s look at how return types are treated, using two functions that differ only by their return type:



```id
tslet x = () => ({ name: "Alice" });let y = () => ({ name: "Alice", location: "Seattle" });x = y; // OKy = x; // Error, because x() lacks a location property
```



The type system enforces that the source function’s return type be a subtype of the target type’s return type.

### Function Parameter Bivariance

When comparing the types of function parameters, assignment succeeds if either the source parameter is assignable to the target parameter, or vice versa.
This is unsound because a caller might end up being given a function that takes a more specialized type, but invokes the function with a less specialized type.
In practice, this sort of error is rare, and allowing this enables many common JavaScript patterns. A brief example:



```id
tsenum EventType {  Mouse,  Keyboard,}interface Event {  timestamp: number;}interface MyMouseEvent extends Event {  x: number;  y: number;}interface MyKeyEvent extends Event {  keyCode: number;}function listenEvent(eventType: EventType, handler: (n: Event) => void) {  /* ... */}// Unsound, but useful and commonlistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: MyMouseEvent) => console.log(e.x + "," + e.y));// Undesirable alternatives in presence of soundnesslistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: Event) =>  console.log((e as MyMouseEvent).x + "," + (e as MyMouseEvent).y));listenEvent(EventType.Mouse, ((e: MyMouseEvent) =>  console.log(e.x + "," + e.y)) as (e: Event) => void);// Still disallowed (clear error). Type safety enforced for wholly incompatible typeslistenEvent(EventType.Mouse, (e: number) => console.log(e));
```



You can have TypeScript raise errors when this happens via the compiler flag `strictFunctionTypes` .

### Optional Parameters and Rest Parameters

When comparing functions for compatibility, optional and required parameters are interchangeable.
Extra optional parameters of the source type are not an error, and optional parameters of the target type without corresponding parameters in the source type are not an error.

When a function has a rest parameter, it is treated as if it were an infinite series of optional parameters.

This is unsound from a type system perspective, but from a runtime point of view the idea of an optional parameter is generally not well-enforced since passing `undefined` in that position is equivalent for most functions.

The motivating example is the common pattern of a function that takes a callback and invokes it with some predictable (to the programmer) but unknown (to the type system) number of arguments:



```id
tsfunction invokeLater(args: any[], callback: (...args: any[]) => void) {  /* ... Invoke callback with 'args' ... */}// Unsound - invokeLater "might" provide any number of argumentsinvokeLater([1, 2], (x, y) => console.log(x + ", " + y));// Confusing (x and y are actually required) and undiscoverableinvokeLater([1, 2], (x?, y?) => console.log(x + ", " + y));
```



### Functions with overloads

When a function has overloads, each overload in the target type must be matched by a compatible signature on the source type.
This ensures that the source function can be called in all the same cases as the target function.

## Enums

Enums are compatible with numbers, and numbers are compatible with enums. Enum values from different enum types are considered incompatible. For example,



```id
tsenum Status {  Ready,  Waiting,}enum Color {  Red,  Blue,  Green,}let status = Status.Ready;status = Color.Green; // Error
```



## Classes

Classes work similarly to object literal types and interfaces with one exception: they have both a static and an instance type.
When comparing two objects of a class type, only members of the instance are compared.
Static members and constructors do not affect compatibility.



```id
tsclass Animal {  feet: number;  constructor(name: string, numFeet: number) {}}class Size {  feet: number;  constructor(numFeet: number) {}}let a: Animal;let s: Size;a = s; // OKs = a; // OK
```



### Private and protected members in classes

Private and protected members in a class affect their compatibility.
When an instance of a class is checked for compatibility, if the target type contains a private member, then the source type must also contain a private member that originated from the same class.
Likewise, the same applies for an instance with a protected member.
This allows a class to be assignment compatible with its super class, but not with classes from a different inheritance hierarchy which otherwise have the same shape.

## Generics

Because TypeScript is a structural type system, type parameters only affect the resulting type when consumed as part of the type of a member. For example,



```id
tsinterface Empty<T> {}let x: Empty<number>;let y: Empty<string>;x = y; // OK, because y matches structure of x
```



In the above, `x` and `y` are compatible because their structures do not use the type argument in a differentiating way.
Changing this example by adding a member to `Empty ` shows how this works:



```id
tsinterface NotEmpty<T> {  data: T;}let x: NotEmpty<number>;let y: NotEmpty<string>;x = y; // Error, because x and y are not compatible
```



In this way, a generic type that has its type arguments specified acts just like a non-generic type.

For generic types that do not have their type arguments specified, compatibility is checked by specifying `any` in place of all unspecified type arguments.
The resulting types are then checked for compatibility, just as in the non-generic case.

For example,



```id
tslet identity = function <T>(x: T): T {  // ...};let reverse = function <U>(y: U): U {  // ...};identity = reverse; // OK, because (x: any) => any matches (y: any) => any
```



## Advanced Topics

### Subtype vs Assignment

So far, we’ve used “compatible”, which is not a term defined in the language spec.
In TypeScript, there are two kinds of compatibility: subtype and assignment.
These differ only in that assignment extends subtype compatibility with rules to allow assignment to and from `any`, and to and from `enum` with corresponding numeric values.

Different places in the language use one of the two compatibility mechanisms, depending on the situation.
For practical purposes, type compatibility is dictated by assignment compatibility, even in the cases of the `implements` and `extends` clauses.

## `any`, `unknown`, `object`, `void`, `undefined`, `null`, and `never` assignability

The following table summarizes assignability between some abstract types.
Rows indicate what each is assignable to, columns indicate what is assignable to them.
A ” ✓ ” indicates a combination that is compatible only when `strictNullChecks` is off.

Reiterating The Basics :

 Everything is assignable to itself.

- `any` and `unknown` are the same in terms of what is assignable to them, different in that `unknown` is not assignable to anything except `any`.

- `unknown` and `never` are like inverses of each other.
Everything is assignable to `unknown`, `never` is assignable to everything.
Nothing is assignable to `never`, `unknown` is not assignable to anything (except `any`).

- `void` is not assignable to or from anything, with the following exceptions: `any`, `unknown`, `never`, `undefined`, and `null` (if `strictNullChecks` is off, see table for details).

- When `strictNullChecks` is off, `null` and `undefined` are similar to `never`: assignable to most types, most types are not assignable to them.
They are assignable to each other.

- When `strictNullChecks` is on, `null` and `undefined` behave more like `void`: not assignable to or from anything, except for `any`, `unknown`, and `void` (`undefined` is always assignable to `void`).

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/asp-net-core.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - ASP.NET Core 

Was this page helpful?

 

# ASP.NET Core

 

## Install ASP.NET Core and TypeScript

First, install ASP.NET Core if you need it. This quick-start guide requires Visual Studio 2015 or 2017.

Next, if your version of Visual Studio does not already have the latest TypeScript, you can install it .

## Create a new project

 Choose File 

- Choose New Project (Ctrl + Shift + N)

- Search for .NET Core in the project search bar

- Select ASP.NET Core Web Application and press the Next button

 

- Name your project and solution. After select the Create button

 

- In the last window, select the Empty template and press the Create button

 

Run the application and make sure that it works.

 

### Set up the server

Open Dependencies > Manage NuGet Packages > Browse. Search and install `Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles` and `Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild`:

 

Open up your `Startup.cs` file and edit your `Configure` function to look like this:



```
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }

    app.UseDefaultFiles();
    app.UseStaticFiles();
}
```

 

You may need to restart VS for the red squiggly lines below `UseDefaultFiles` and `UseStaticFiles` to disappear.

## Add TypeScript

Next we will add a new folder and call it `scripts`.

 

 

## Add TypeScript code

Right click on `scripts` and click New Item . Then choose TypeScript File and name the file `app.ts`

 

### Add example code

Add the following code to the `app.ts` file.



```id
tsfunction sayHello() {  const compiler = (document.getElementById("compiler") as HTMLInputElement)    .value;  const framework = (document.getElementById("framework") as HTMLInputElement)    .value;  return `Hello from ${compiler} and ${framework}!`;}
```



## Set up the build

 Configure the TypeScript compiler 

First we need to tell TypeScript how to build. Right click on `scripts` and click New Item . Then choose TypeScript Configuration File and use the default name of `tsconfig.json`

 

Replace the contents of the `tsconfig.json` file with:



```
{  "compilerOptions": {    "noEmitOnError": true,    "noImplicitAny": true,    "sourceMap": true,    "target": "es6"  },  "files": ["./app.ts"],  "compileOnSave": true}
```



- `noEmitOnError` : Do not emit outputs if any errors were reported.

- `noImplicitAny` : Raise error on expressions and declarations with an implied `any` type.

- `sourceMap` : Generates corresponding `.map` file.

- `target` : Specify ECMAScript target version.

Note: `"ESNext"` targets latest supported

 `noImplicitAny` is good idea whenever you’re writing new code — you can make sure that you don’t write any untyped code by mistake. `"compileOnSave"` makes it easy to update your code in a running web app.

#### Set up NPM 

We need to setup NPM so that JavaScript packages can be downloaded. Right click on the project and select New Item . Then choose NPM Configuration File and use the default name of `package.json`.

 

Inside the `"devDependencies"` section of the `package.json` file, add gulp and del 



```
"devDependencies": {    "gulp": "4.0.2",    "del": "5.1.0"}
```



Visual Studio should start installing gulp and del as soon as you save the file. If not, right-click package.json and then Restore Packages.

After you should see an `npm` folder in your solution explorer

 

#### Set up gulp 

Right click on the project and click New Item . Then choose JavaScript File and use the name of `gulpfile.js`



```id
js/// <binding AfterBuild='default' Clean='clean' />/*This file is the main entry point for defining Gulp tasks and using Gulp plugins.Click here to learn more. http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518007*/var gulp = require("gulp");var del = require("del");var paths = {  scripts: ["scripts/**/*.js", "scripts/**/*.ts", "scripts/**/*.map"],};gulp.task("clean", function () {  return del(["wwwroot/scripts/**/*"]);});gulp.task("default", function (done) {    gulp.src(paths.scripts).pipe(gulp.dest("wwwroot/scripts"));    done();});
```



The first line tells Visual Studio to run the task ‘default’ after the build finishes. It will also run the ‘clean’ task when you ask Visual Studio to clean the build.

Now right-click on `gulpfile.js` and click Task Runner Explorer.

 

If ‘default’ and ‘clean’ tasks don’t show up, refresh the explorer:

 

## Write a HTML page

Right click on the `wwwroot` folder (if you don’t see the folder try building the project) and add a New Item named `index.html` inside. Use the following code for `index.html`



```
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>    <meta charset="utf-8" />    <script src="scripts/app.js"></script>    <title></title></head><body>    <div id="message"></div>    <div>        Compiler: <input id="compiler" value="TypeScript" onkeyup="document.getElementById('message').innerText = sayHello()" /><br />        Framework: <input id="framework" value="ASP.NET" onkeyup="document.getElementById('message').innerText = sayHello()" />    </div></body></html>
```



## Test

- Run the project

- As you type on the boxes you should see the message appear/change!

 

## Debug

- In Edge, press F12 and click the Debugger tab.

- Look in the first localhost folder, then scripts/app.ts

- Put a breakpoint on the line with return.

- Type in the boxes and confirm that the breakpoint hits in TypeScript code and that inspection works correctly.

 

Congrats you’ve built your own .NET Core project with a TypeScript frontend.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Type Inference

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html#handbook-content

TypeScript: Documentation - Type Inference 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Type Inference

 

In TypeScript, there are several places where type inference is used to provide type information when there is no explicit type annotation. For example, in this code



```id
tslet x = 3;   let x: numberTry
```



The type of the `x` variable is inferred to be `number`.
This kind of inference takes place when initializing variables and members, setting parameter default values, and determining function return types.

In most cases, type inference is straightforward.
In the following sections, we’ll explore some of the nuances in how types are inferred.

## Best common type

When a type inference is made from several expressions, the types of those expressions are used to calculate a “best common type”. For example,



```id
tslet x = [0, 1, null];   let x: (number | null)[]Try
```



To infer the type of `x` in the example above, we must consider the type of each array element.
Here we are given two choices for the type of the array: `number` and `null`.
The best common type algorithm considers each candidate type, and picks the type that is compatible with all the other candidates.

Because the best common type has to be chosen from the provided candidate types, there are some cases where types share a common structure, but no one type is the super type of all candidate types. For example:



```id
tslet zoo = [new Rhino(), new Elephant(), new Snake()];    let zoo: (Rhino | Elephant | Snake)[]Try
```



Ideally, we may want `zoo` to be inferred as an `Animal[]`, but because there is no object that is strictly of type `Animal` in the array, we make no inference about the array element type.
To correct this, explicitly provide the type when no one type is a super type of all other candidates:



```id
tslet zoo: Animal[] = [new Rhino(), new Elephant(), new Snake()];    let zoo: Animal[]Try
```



When no best common type is found, the resulting inference is the union array type, `(Rhino | Elephant | Snake)[]`.

## Contextual Typing

Type inference also works in “the other direction” in some cases in TypeScript.
This is known as “contextual typing”. Contextual typing occurs when the type of an expression is implied by its location. For example:



```id
tswindow. any) & ((this: Window, ev: MouseEvent) => any)) | null' >onmousedown = function (mouseEvent) {  console.log(mouseEvent.button);  console.log(mouseEvent.kangaroo);Property 'kangaroo' does not exist on type 'MouseEvent'.2339Property 'kangaroo' does not exist on type 'MouseEvent'.};Try
```



Here, the TypeScript type checker used the type of the `Window.onmousedown` function to infer the type of the function expression on the right hand side of the assignment.
When it did so, it was able to infer the type of the `mouseEvent` parameter, which does contain a `button` property, but not a `kangaroo` property.

This works because window already has `onmousedown` declared in its type:



```id
ts// Declares there is a global variable called 'window'declare var window: Window & typeof globalThis;// Which is declared as (simplified):interface Window extends GlobalEventHandlers {  // ...}// Which defines a lot of known handler eventsinterface GlobalEventHandlers {  onmousedown: ((this: GlobalEventHandlers, ev: MouseEvent) => any) | null;  // ...}
```



TypeScript is smart enough to infer types in other contexts as well:



```id
tswindow. any) & ((this: Window, ev: Event) => any)) | null' >onscroll = function (uiEvent) {  console.log(uiEvent.button);Property 'button' does not exist on type 'Event'.2339Property 'button' does not exist on type 'Event'.};Try
```



Based on the fact that the above function is being assigned to `Window.onscroll`, TypeScript knows that `uiEvent` is a UIEvent , and not a MouseEvent like the previous example. `UIEvent` objects contain no `button` property, and so TypeScript will throw an error.

If this function were not in a contextually typed position, the function’s argument would implicitly have type `any`, and no error would be issued (unless you are using the `noImplicitAny` option):



```id
tsconst  void' >handler = function (uiEvent) {  console.log(uiEvent.button); // <- OK};Try
```



We can also explicitly give type information to the function’s argument to override any contextual type:



```id
tswindow. any) & ((this: Window, ev: Event) => any)) | null' >onscroll = function (uiEvent: any) {  console.log(uiEvent.button); // <- Now, no error is given};Try
```



However, this code will log `undefined`, since `uiEvent` has no property called `button`.

Contextual typing applies in many cases.
Common cases include arguments to function calls, right hand sides of assignments, type assertions, members of object and array literals, and return statements.
The contextual type also acts as a candidate type in best common type. For example:



```id
tsfunction createZoo(): Animal[] {  return [new Rhino(), new Elephant(), new Snake()];}Try
```



In this example, best common type has a set of four candidates: `Animal`, `Rhino`, `Elephant`, and `Snake`.
Of these, `Animal` can be chosen by the best common type algorithm.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Gulp

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/gulp.html

- TypeScript: Documentation - Gulp 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Gulp

 

This quick start guide will teach you how to build TypeScript with gulp and then add Browserify , terser , or Watchify to the gulp pipeline.
This guide also shows how to add Babel functionality using Babelify .

We assume that you’re already using Node.js with npm .

## Minimal project

Let’s start out with a new directory.
We’ll name it `proj` for now, but you can change it to whatever you want.



```id
shellmkdir projcd proj
```



To start, we’re going to structure our project in the following way:



```
proj/   ├─ src/   └─ dist/
```



TypeScript files will start out in your `src` folder, run through the TypeScript compiler and end up in `dist`.

Let’s scaffold this out:



```id
shellmkdir srcmkdir dist
```



### Initialize the project

Now we’ll turn this folder into an npm package.



```id
shellnpm init
```



You’ll be given a series of prompts.
You can use the defaults except for your entry point.
For your entry point, use `./dist/main.js`.
You can always go back and change these in the `package.json` file that’s been generated for you.

### Install our dependencies

Now we can use `npm install` to install packages.
First install `gulp-cli` globally (if you use a Unix system, you may need to prefix the `npm install` commands in this guide with `sudo`).



```id
shellnpm install -g gulp-cli
```



Then install `typescript`, `gulp` and `gulp-typescript` in your project’s dev dependencies.
 Gulp-typescript is a gulp plugin for TypeScript.



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev typescript gulp@4.0.0 gulp-typescript
```



### Write a simple example

Let’s write a Hello World program.
In `src`, create the file `main.ts`:



```id
tsfunction hello(compiler: string) {  console.log(`Hello from ${compiler}`);}hello("TypeScript");
```



In the project root, `proj`, create the file `tsconfig.json`:



```
{  "files": ["src/main.ts"],  "compilerOptions": {    "noImplicitAny": true,    "target": "es5"  }}
```



### Create a `gulpfile.js`

In the project root, create the file `gulpfile.js`:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var ts = require("gulp-typescript");var tsProject = ts.createProject("tsconfig.json");gulp.task("default", function () {  return tsProject.src().pipe(tsProject()).js.pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});
```



### Test the resulting app



```id
shellgulpnode dist/main.js
```



The program should print “Hello from TypeScript!“.

## Add modules to the code

Before we get to Browserify, let’s build our code out and add modules to the mix.
This is the structure you’re more likely to use for a real app.

Create a file called `src/greet.ts`:



```id
tsexport function sayHello(name: string) {  return `Hello from ${name}`;}
```



Now change the code in `src/main.ts` to import `sayHello` from `greet.ts`:



```id
tsimport { sayHello } from "./greet";console.log(sayHello("TypeScript"));
```



Finally, add `src/greet.ts` to `tsconfig.json`:



```
{  "files": ["src/main.ts", "src/greet.ts"],  "compilerOptions": {    "noImplicitAny": true,    "target": "es5"  }}
```



Make sure that the modules work by running `gulp` and then testing in Node:



```id
shellgulpnode dist/main.js
```



Notice that even though we used ES2015 module syntax, TypeScript emitted CommonJS modules that Node uses.
We’ll stick with CommonJS for this tutorial, but you could set `module` in the options object to change this.

## Browserify

Now let’s move this project from Node to the browser.
To do this, we’d like to bundle all our modules into one JavaScript file.
Fortunately, that’s exactly what Browserify does.
Even better, it lets us use the CommonJS module system used by Node, which is the default TypeScript emit.
That means our TypeScript and Node setup will transfer to the browser basically unchanged.

First, install browserify, tsify , and vinyl-source-stream.
tsify is a Browserify plugin that, like gulp-typescript, gives access to the TypeScript compiler.
vinyl-source-stream lets us adapt the file output of Browserify back into a format that gulp understands called vinyl .



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev browserify tsify vinyl-source-stream
```



### Create a page

Create a file in `src` named `index.html`:



```id
html<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <meta charset="UTF-8" />    <title>Hello World!</title>  </head>  <body>    <p id="greeting">Loading ...</p>    <script src="bundle.js"></script>  </body></html>
```



Now change `main.ts` to update the page:



```id
tsimport { sayHello } from "./greet";function showHello(divName: string, name: string) {  const elt = document.getElementById(divName);  elt.innerText = sayHello(name);}showHello("greeting", "TypeScript");
```



Calling `showHello` calls `sayHello` to change the paragraph’s text.
Now change your gulpfile to the following:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var browserify = require("browserify");var source = require("vinyl-source-stream");var tsify = require("tsify");var paths = {  pages: ["src/*.html"],};gulp.task("copy-html", function () {  return gulp.src(paths.pages).pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});gulp.task(  "default",  gulp.series(gulp.parallel("copy-html"), function () {    return browserify({      basedir: ".",      debug: true,      entries: ["src/main.ts"],      cache: {},      packageCache: {},    })      .plugin(tsify)      .bundle()      .pipe(source("bundle.js"))      .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));  }));
```



This adds the `copy-html` task and adds it as a dependency of `default`.
That means any time `default` is run, `copy-html` has to run first.
We’ve also changed `default` to call Browserify with the tsify plugin instead of gulp-typescript.
Conveniently, they both allow us to pass the same options object to the TypeScript compiler.

After calling `bundle` we use `source` (our alias for vinyl-source-stream) to name our output bundle `bundle.js`.

Test the page by running gulp and then opening `dist/index.html` in a browser.
You should see “Hello from TypeScript” on the page.

Notice that we specified `debug: true` to Browserify.
This causes tsify to emit source maps inside the bundled JavaScript file.
Source maps let you debug your original TypeScript code in the browser instead of the bundled JavaScript.
You can test that source maps are working by opening the debugger for your browser and putting a breakpoint inside `main.ts`.
When you refresh the page the breakpoint should pause the page and let you debug `greet.ts`.

## Watchify, Babel, and Terser

Now that we are bundling our code with Browserify and tsify, we can add various features to our build with browserify plugins.

 

Watchify starts gulp and keeps it running, incrementally compiling whenever you save a file.
This lets you keep an edit-save-refresh cycle going in the browser.

- 

Babel is a hugely flexible compiler that converts ES2015 and beyond into ES5 and ES3.
This lets you add extensive and customized transformations that TypeScript doesn’t support.

- 

Terser compacts your code so that it takes less time to download.

### Watchify

We’ll start with Watchify to provide background compilation:



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev watchify fancy-log
```



Now change your gulpfile to the following:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var browserify = require("browserify");var source = require("vinyl-source-stream");var watchify = require("watchify");var tsify = require("tsify");var fancy_log = require("fancy-log");var paths = {  pages: ["src/*.html"],};var watchedBrowserify = watchify(  browserify({    basedir: ".",    debug: true,    entries: ["src/main.ts"],    cache: {},    packageCache: {},  }).plugin(tsify));gulp.task("copy-html", function () {  return gulp.src(paths.pages).pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});function bundle() {  return watchedBrowserify    .bundle()    .on("error", fancy_log)    .pipe(source("bundle.js"))    .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));}gulp.task("default", gulp.series(gulp.parallel("copy-html"), bundle));watchedBrowserify.on("update", bundle);watchedBrowserify.on("log", fancy_log);
```



There are basically three changes here, but they require you to refactor your code a bit.

- We wrapped our `browserify` instance in a call to `watchify`, and then held on to the result.

- We called `watchedBrowserify.on('update', bundle);` so that Browserify will run the `bundle` function every time one of your TypeScript files changes.

- We called `watchedBrowserify.on('log', fancy_log);` to log to the console.

Together (1) and (2) mean that we have to move our call to `browserify` out of the `default` task.
And we have to give the function for `default` a name since both Watchify and Gulp need to call it.
Adding logging with (3) is optional but very useful for debugging your setup.

Now when you run Gulp, it should start and stay running.
Try changing the code for `showHello` in `main.ts` and saving it.
You should see output that looks like this:



```id
shellproj$ gulp[10:34:20] Using gulpfile ~/src/proj/gulpfile.js[10:34:20] Starting 'copy-html'...[10:34:20] Finished 'copy-html' after 26 ms[10:34:20] Starting 'default'...[10:34:21] 2824 bytes written (0.13 seconds)[10:34:21] Finished 'default' after 1.36 s[10:35:22] 2261 bytes written (0.02 seconds)[10:35:24] 2808 bytes written (0.05 seconds)
```



### Terser

First install Terser.
Since the point of Terser is to mangle your code, we also need to install vinyl-buffer and gulp-sourcemaps to keep sourcemaps working.



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev gulp-terser vinyl-buffer gulp-sourcemaps
```



Now change your gulpfile to the following:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var browserify = require("browserify");var source = require("vinyl-source-stream");var terser = require("gulp-terser");var tsify = require("tsify");var sourcemaps = require("gulp-sourcemaps");var buffer = require("vinyl-buffer");var paths = {  pages: ["src/*.html"],};gulp.task("copy-html", function () {  return gulp.src(paths.pages).pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});gulp.task(  "default",  gulp.series(gulp.parallel("copy-html"), function () {    return browserify({      basedir: ".",      debug: true,      entries: ["src/main.ts"],      cache: {},      packageCache: {},    })      .plugin(tsify)      .bundle()      .pipe(source("bundle.js"))      .pipe(buffer())      .pipe(sourcemaps.init({ loadMaps: true }))      .pipe(terser())      .pipe(sourcemaps.write("./"))      .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));  }));
```



Notice that `terser` itself has just one call — the calls to `buffer` and `sourcemaps` exist to make sure sourcemaps keep working.
These calls give us a separate sourcemap file instead of using inline sourcemaps like before.
Now you can run Gulp and check that `bundle.js` does get minified into an unreadable mess:



```id
shellgulpcat dist/bundle.js
```



### Babel

First install Babelify and the Babel preset for ES2015.
Like Terser, Babelify mangles code, so we’ll need vinyl-buffer and gulp-sourcemaps.
By default Babelify will only process files with extensions of `.js`, `.es`, `.es6` and `.jsx` so we need to add the `.ts` extension as an option to Babelify.



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev babelify@8 babel-core babel-preset-es2015 vinyl-buffer gulp-sourcemaps
```



Now change your gulpfile to the following:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var browserify = require("browserify");var source = require("vinyl-source-stream");var tsify = require("tsify");var sourcemaps = require("gulp-sourcemaps");var buffer = require("vinyl-buffer");var paths = {  pages: ["src/*.html"],};gulp.task("copy-html", function () {  return gulp.src(paths.pages).pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});gulp.task(  "default",  gulp.series(gulp.parallel("copy-html"), function () {    return browserify({      basedir: ".",      debug: true,      entries: ["src/main.ts"],      cache: {},      packageCache: {},    })      .plugin(tsify)      .transform("babelify", {        presets: ["es2015"],        extensions: [".ts"],      })      .bundle()      .pipe(source("bundle.js"))      .pipe(buffer())      .pipe(sourcemaps.init({ loadMaps: true }))      .pipe(sourcemaps.write("./"))      .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));  }));
```



We also need to have TypeScript target ES2015.
Babel will then produce ES5 from the ES2015 code that TypeScript emits.
Let’s modify `tsconfig.json`:



```
{  "files": ["src/main.ts"],  "compilerOptions": {    "noImplicitAny": true,    "target": "es2015"  }}
```



Babel’s ES5 output should be very similar to TypeScript’s output for such a simple script.

### TypeScript: Documentation - Variable Declaration

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/variable-declarations.html#handbook-content

TypeScript: Documentation - Variable Declaration 

Was this page helpful?

 

# Variable Declaration

 

`let` and `const` are two relatively new concepts for variable declarations in JavaScript.
 As we mentioned earlier , `let` is similar to `var` in some respects, but allows users to avoid some of the common “gotchas” that users run into in JavaScript.

`const` is an augmentation of `let` in that it prevents re-assignment to a variable.

With TypeScript being an extension of JavaScript, the language naturally supports `let` and `const`.
Here we’ll elaborate more on these new declarations and why they’re preferable to `var`.

If you’ve used JavaScript offhandedly, the next section might be a good way to refresh your memory.
If you’re intimately familiar with all the quirks of `var` declarations in JavaScript, you might find it easier to skip ahead.

## `var` declarations

Declaring a variable in JavaScript has always traditionally been done with the `var` keyword.



```id
tsvar a = 10;
```



As you might’ve figured out, we just declared a variable named `a` with the value `10`.

We can also declare a variable inside of a function:



```id
tsfunction f() {  var message = "Hello, world!";  return message;}
```



and we can also access those same variables within other functions:



```id
tsfunction f() {  var a = 10;  return function g() {    var b = a + 1;    return b;  };}var g = f();g(); // returns '11'
```



In this above example, `g` captured the variable `a` declared in `f`.
At any point that `g` gets called, the value of `a` will be tied to the value of `a` in `f`.
Even if `g` is called once `f` is done running, it will be able to access and modify `a`.



```id
tsfunction f() {  var a = 1;  a = 2;  var b = g();  a = 3;  return b;  function g() {    return a;  }}f(); // returns '2'
```



### Scoping rules

`var` declarations have some odd scoping rules for those used to other languages.
Take the following example:



```id
tsfunction f(shouldInitialize: boolean) {  if (shouldInitialize) {    var x = 10;  }  return x;}f(true); // returns '10'f(false); // returns 'undefined'
```



Some readers might do a double-take at this example.
The variable `x` was declared within the `if` block , and yet we were able to access it from outside that block.
That’s because `var` declarations are accessible anywhere within their containing function, module, namespace, or global scope - all which we’ll go over later on - regardless of the containing block.
Some people call this `var`-scoping or function-scoping .
Parameters are also function scoped.

These scoping rules can cause several types of mistakes.
One problem they exacerbate is the fact that it is not an error to declare the same variable multiple times:



```id
tsfunction sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {  var sum = 0;  for (var i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {    var currentRow = matrix[i];    for (var i = 0; i < currentRow.length; i++) {      sum += currentRow[i];    }  }  return sum;}
```



Maybe it was easy to spot out for some experienced JavaScript developers, but the inner `for`-loop will accidentally overwrite the variable `i` because `i` refers to the same function-scoped variable.
As experienced developers know by now, similar sorts of bugs slip through code reviews and can be an endless source of frustration.

### Variable capturing quirks

Take a quick second to guess what the output of the following snippet is:



```id
tsfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  setTimeout(function () {    console.log(i);  }, 100 * i);}
```



For those unfamiliar, `setTimeout` will try to execute a function after a certain number of milliseconds (though waiting for anything else to stop running).

Ready? Take a look:



```
10101010101010101010
```



Many JavaScript developers are intimately familiar with this behavior, but if you’re surprised, you’re certainly not alone.
Most people expect the output to be



```
0123456789
```



Remember what we mentioned earlier about variable capturing?
Every function expression we pass to `setTimeout` actually refers to the same `i` from the same scope.

Let’s take a minute to consider what that means.
`setTimeout` will run a function after some number of milliseconds, but only after the `for` loop has stopped executing;
By the time the `for` loop has stopped executing, the value of `i` is `10`.
So each time the given function gets called, it will print out `10`!

A common work around is to use an IIFE - an Immediately Invoked Function Expression - to capture `i` at each iteration:



```id
tsfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  // capture the current state of 'i'  // by invoking a function with its current value  (function (i) {    setTimeout(function () {      console.log(i);    }, 100 * i);  })(i);}
```



This odd-looking pattern is actually pretty common.
The `i` in the parameter list actually shadows the `i` declared in the `for` loop, but since we named them the same, we didn’t have to modify the loop body too much.

## `let` declarations

By now you’ve figured out that `var` has some problems, which is precisely why `let` statements were introduced.
Apart from the keyword used, `let` statements are written the same way `var` statements are.



```id
tslet hello = "Hello!";
```



The key difference is not in the syntax, but in the semantics, which we’ll now dive into.

### Block-scoping

When a variable is declared using `let`, it uses what some call lexical-scoping or block-scoping .
Unlike variables declared with `var` whose scopes leak out to their containing function, block-scoped variables are not visible outside of their nearest containing block or `for`-loop.



```id
tsfunction f(input: boolean) {  let a = 100;  if (input) {    // Still okay to reference 'a'    let b = a + 1;    return b;  }  // Error: 'b' doesn't exist here  return b;}
```



Here, we have two local variables `a` and `b`.
`a`’s scope is limited to the body of `f` while `b`’s scope is limited to the containing `if` statement’s block.

Variables declared in a `catch` clause also have similar scoping rules.



```id
tstry {  throw "oh no!";} catch (e) {  console.log("Oh well.");}// Error: 'e' doesn't exist hereconsole.log(e);
```



Another property of block-scoped variables is that they can’t be read or written to before they’re actually declared.
While these variables are “present” throughout their scope, all points up until their declaration are part of their temporal dead zone .
This is just a sophisticated way of saying you can’t access them before the `let` statement, and luckily TypeScript will let you know that.



```id
tsa++; // illegal to use 'a' before it's declared;let a;
```



Something to note is that you can still capture a block-scoped variable before it’s declared.
The only catch is that it’s illegal to call that function before the declaration.
If targeting ES2015, a modern runtime will throw an error; however, right now TypeScript is permissive and won’t report this as an error.



```id
tsfunction foo() {  // okay to capture 'a'  return a;}// illegal call 'foo' before 'a' is declared// runtimes should throw an error herefoo();let a;
```



For more information on temporal dead zones, see relevant content on the Mozilla Developer Network .

### Re-declarations and Shadowing

With `var` declarations, we mentioned that it didn’t matter how many times you declared your variables; you just got one.



```id
tsfunction f(x) {  var x;  var x;  if (true) {    var x;  }}
```



In the above example, all declarations of `x` actually refer to the same `x`, and this is perfectly valid.
This often ends up being a source of bugs.
Thankfully, `let` declarations are not as forgiving.



```id
tslet x = 10;let x = 20; // error: can't re-declare 'x' in the same scope
```



The variables don’t necessarily need to both be block-scoped for TypeScript to tell us that there’s a problem.



```id
tsfunction f(x) {  let x = 100; // error: interferes with parameter declaration}function g() {  let x = 100;  var x = 100; // error: can't have both declarations of 'x'}
```



That’s not to say that a block-scoped variable can never be declared with a function-scoped variable.
The block-scoped variable just needs to be declared within a distinctly different block.



```id
tsfunction f(condition, x) {  if (condition) {    let x = 100;    return x;  }  return x;}f(false, 0); // returns '0'f(true, 0); // returns '100'
```



The act of introducing a new name in a more nested scope is called shadowing .
It is a bit of a double-edged sword in that it can introduce certain bugs on its own in the event of accidental shadowing, while also preventing certain bugs.
For instance, imagine we had written our earlier `sumMatrix` function using `let` variables.



```id
tsfunction sumMatrix(matrix: number[][]) {  let sum = 0;  for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {    var currentRow = matrix[i];    for (let i = 0; i < currentRow.length; i++) {      sum += currentRow[i];    }  }  return sum;}
```



This version of the loop will actually perform the summation correctly because the inner loop’s `i` shadows `i` from the outer loop.

Shadowing should usually be avoided in the interest of writing clearer code.
While there are some scenarios where it may be fitting to take advantage of it, you should use your best judgement.

### Block-scoped variable capturing

When we first touched on the idea of variable capturing with `var` declaration, we briefly went into how variables act once captured.
To give a better intuition of this, each time a scope is run, it creates an “environment” of variables.
That environment and its captured variables can exist even after everything within its scope has finished executing.



```id
tsfunction theCityThatAlwaysSleeps() {  let getCity;  if (true) {    let city = "Seattle";    getCity = function () {      return city;    };  }  return getCity();}
```



Because we’ve captured `city` from within its environment, we’re still able to access it despite the fact that the `if` block finished executing.

Recall that with our earlier `setTimeout` example, we ended up needing to use an IIFE to capture the state of a variable for every iteration of the `for` loop.
In effect, what we were doing was creating a new variable environment for our captured variables.
That was a bit of a pain, but luckily, you’ll never have to do that again in TypeScript.

`let` declarations have drastically different behavior when declared as part of a loop.
Rather than just introducing a new environment to the loop itself, these declarations sort of create a new scope per iteration .
Since this is what we were doing anyway with our IIFE, we can change our old `setTimeout` example to just use a `let` declaration.



```id
tsfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  setTimeout(function () {    console.log(i);  }, 100 * i);}
```



and as expected, this will print out



```
0123456789
```



## `const` declarations

`const` declarations are another way of declaring variables.



```id
tsconst numLivesForCat = 9;
```



They are like `let` declarations but, as their name implies, their value cannot be changed once they are bound.
In other words, they have the same scoping rules as `let`, but you can’t re-assign to them.

This should not be confused with the idea that the values they refer to are immutable .



```id
tsconst numLivesForCat = 9;const kitty = {  name: "Aurora",  numLives: numLivesForCat,};// Errorkitty = {  name: "Danielle",  numLives: numLivesForCat,};// all "okay"kitty.name = "Rory";kitty.name = "Kitty";kitty.name = "Cat";kitty.numLives--;
```



Unless you take specific measures to avoid it, the internal state of a `const` variable is still modifiable.
Fortunately, TypeScript allows you to specify that members of an object are `readonly`.
The chapter on Interfaces has the details.

## `let` vs. `const`

Given that we have two types of declarations with similar scoping semantics, it’s natural to find ourselves asking which one to use.
Like most broad questions, the answer is: it depends.

Applying the principle of least privilege , all declarations other than those you plan to modify should use `const`.
The rationale is that if a variable didn’t need to get written to, others working on the same codebase shouldn’t automatically be able to write to the object, and will need to consider whether they really need to reassign to the variable.
Using `const` also makes code more predictable when reasoning about flow of data.

Use your best judgement, and if applicable, consult the matter with the rest of your team.

The majority of this handbook uses `let` declarations.

## Destructuring

Another ECMAScript 2015 feature that TypeScript has is destructuring.
For a complete reference, see the article on the Mozilla Developer Network .
In this section, we’ll give a short overview.

### Array destructuring

The simplest form of destructuring is array destructuring assignment:



```id
tslet input = [1, 2];let [first, second] = input;console.log(first); // outputs 1console.log(second); // outputs 2
```



This creates two new variables named `first` and `second`.
This is equivalent to using indexing, but is much more convenient:



```id
tsfirst = input[0];second = input[1];
```



Destructuring works with already-declared variables as well:



```id
ts// swap variables[first, second] = [second, first];
```



And with parameters to a function:



```id
tsfunction f([first, second]: [number, number]) {  console.log(first);  console.log(second);}f([1, 2]);
```



You can create a variable for the remaining items in a list using the syntax `...`:



```id
tslet [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];console.log(first); // outputs 1console.log(rest); // outputs [ 2, 3, 4 ]
```



Of course, since this is JavaScript, you can just ignore trailing elements you don’t care about:



```id
tslet [first] = [1, 2, 3, 4];console.log(first); // outputs 1
```



Or other elements:



```id
tslet [, second, , fourth] = [1, 2, 3, 4];console.log(second); // outputs 2console.log(fourth); // outputs 4
```



### Tuple destructuring

Tuples may be destructured like arrays; the destructuring variables get the types of the corresponding tuple elements:



```id
tslet tuple: [number, string, boolean] = [7, "hello", true];let [a, b, c] = tuple; // a: number, b: string, c: boolean
```



It’s an error to destructure a tuple beyond the range of its elements:



```id
tslet [a, b, c, d] = tuple; // Error, no element at index 3
```



As with arrays, you can destructure the rest of the tuple with `...`, to get a shorter tuple:



```id
tslet [a, ...bc] = tuple; // bc: [string, boolean]let [a, b, c, ...d] = tuple; // d: [], the empty tuple
```



Or ignore trailing elements, or other elements:



```id
tslet [a] = tuple; // a: numberlet [, b] = tuple; // b: string
```



### Object destructuring

You can also destructure objects:



```id
tslet o = {  a: "foo",  b: 12,  c: "bar",};let { a, b } = o;
```



This creates new variables `a` and `b` from `o.a` and `o.b`.
Notice that you can skip `c` if you don’t need it.

Like array destructuring, you can have assignment without declaration:



```id
ts({ a, b } = { a: "baz", b: 101 });
```



Notice that we had to surround this statement with parentheses.
JavaScript normally parses a `{` as the start of block.

You can create a variable for the remaining items in an object using the syntax `...`:



```id
tslet { a, ...passthrough } = o;let total = passthrough.b + passthrough.c.length;
```



#### Property renaming

You can also give different names to properties:



```id
tslet { a: newName1, b: newName2 } = o;
```



Here the syntax starts to get confusing.
You can read `a: newName1` as ”`a` as `newName1`”.
The direction is left-to-right, as if you had written:



```id
tslet newName1 = o.a;let newName2 = o.b;
```



Confusingly, the colon here does not indicate the type.
The type, if you specify it, still needs to be written after the entire destructuring:



```id
tslet { a: newName1, b: newName2 }: { a: string; b: number } = o;
```



#### Default values

Default values let you specify a default value in case a property is undefined:



```id
tsfunction keepWholeObject(wholeObject: { a: string; b?: number }) {  let { a, b = 1001 } = wholeObject;}
```



In this example the `b?` indicates that `b` is optional, so it may be `undefined`.
`keepWholeObject` now has a variable for `wholeObject` as well as the properties `a` and `b`, even if `b` is undefined.

## Function declarations

Destructuring also works in function declarations.
For simple cases this is straightforward:



```id
tstype C = { a: string; b?: number };function f({ a, b }: C): void {  // ...}
```



But specifying defaults is more common for parameters, and getting defaults right with destructuring can be tricky.
First of all, you need to remember to put the pattern before the default value.



```id
tsfunction f({ a = "", b = 0 } = {}): void {  // ...}f();
```


 

The snippet above is an example of type inference, explained earlier in the handbook.

 

Then, you need to remember to give a default for optional properties on the destructured property instead of the main initializer.
Remember that `C` was defined with `b` optional:



```id
tsfunction f({ a, b = 0 } = { a: "" }): void {  // ...}f({ a: "yes" }); // ok, default b = 0f(); // ok, default to { a: "" }, which then defaults b = 0f({}); // error, 'a' is required if you supply an argument
```



Use destructuring with care.
As the previous example demonstrates, anything but the simplest destructuring expression is confusing.
This is especially true with deeply nested destructuring, which gets really hard to understand even without piling on renaming, default values, and type annotations.
Try to keep destructuring expressions small and simple.
You can always write the assignments that destructuring would generate yourself.

## Spread

The spread operator is the opposite of destructuring.
It allows you to spread an array into another array, or an object into another object.
For example:



```id
tslet first = [1, 2];let second = [3, 4];let bothPlus = [0, ...first, ...second, 5];
```



This gives bothPlus the value `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
Spreading creates a shallow copy of `first` and `second`.
They are not changed by the spread.

You can also spread objects:



```id
tslet defaults = { food: "spicy", price: "$", ambiance: "noisy" };let search = { ...defaults, food: "rich" };
```



Now `search` is `{ food: "rich", price: "$$", ambiance: "noisy" }`.
Object spreading is more complex than array spreading.
Like array spreading, it proceeds from left-to-right, but the result is still an object.
This means that properties that come later in the spread object overwrite properties that come earlier.
So if we modify the previous example to spread at the end:



```id
tslet defaults = { food: "spicy", price: "$", ambiance: "noisy" };let search = { food: "rich", ...defaults };
```



Then the `food` property in `defaults` overwrites `food: "rich"`, which is not what we want in this case.

Object spread also has a couple of other surprising limits.
First, it only includes an objects’
 own, enumerable properties .
Basically, that means you lose methods when you spread instances of an object:



```id
tsclass C {  p = 12;  m() {}}let c = new C();let clone = { ...c };clone.p; // okclone.m(); // error!
```



Second, the TypeScript compiler doesn’t allow spreads of type parameters from generic functions.
That feature is expected in future versions of the language.

## `using` declarations

`using` declarations are an upcoming feature for JavaScript that are part of the
 Stage 3 Explicit Resource Management proposal. A
`using` declaration is much like a `const` declaration, except that it couples the lifetime of the value bound to the
declaration with the scope of the variable.

When control exits the block containing a `using` declaration, the `[Symbol.dispose]()` method of the
declared value is executed, which allows that value to perform cleanup:



```id
tsfunction f() {  using x = new C();  doSomethingWith(x);} // `x[Symbol.dispose]()` is called
```



At runtime, this has an effect roughly equivalent to the following:



```id
tsfunction f() {  const x = new C();  try {    doSomethingWith(x);  }  finally {    x[Symbol.dispose]();  }}
```



`using` declarations are extremely useful for avoiding memory leaks when working with JavaScript objects that hold on to
native references like file handles



```id
ts{  using file = await openFile();  file.write(text);  doSomethingThatMayThrow();} // `file` is disposed, even if an error is thrown
```



or scoped operations like tracing



```id
tsfunction f() {  using activity = new TraceActivity("f"); // traces entry into function  // ...} // traces exit of function
```



Unlike `var`, `let`, and `const`, `using` declarations do not support destructuring.

### `null` and `undefined`

It’s important to note that the value can be `null` or `undefined`, in which case nothing is disposed at the end of the
block:



```id
ts{  using x = b ? new C() : null;  // ...}
```



which is roughly equivalent to:



```id
ts{  const x = b ? new C() : null;  try {    // ...  }  finally {    x?.[Symbol.dispose]();  }}
```



This allows you to conditionally acquire resources when declaring a `using` declaration without the need for complex
branching or repetition.

### Defining a disposable resource

You can indicate the classes or objects you produce are disposable by implementing the `Disposable` interface:



```id
ts// from the default lib:interface Disposable {  [Symbol.dispose](): void;}// usage:class TraceActivity implements Disposable {  readonly name: string;  constructor(name: string) {    this.name = name;    console.log(`Entering: ${name}`);  }  [Symbol.dispose](): void {    console.log(`Exiting: ${name}`);  }}function f() {  using _activity = new TraceActivity("f");  console.log("Hello world!");}f();// prints://   Entering: f//   Hello world!//   Exiting: f
```



## `await using` declarations

Some resources or operations may have cleanup that needs to be performed asynchronously. To accommodate this, the
 Explicit Resource Management proposal also introduces
the `await using` declaration:



```id
tsasync function f() {  await using x = new C();} // `await x[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` is invoked
```



An `await using` declaration invokes, and awaits , its value’s `[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` method as control leaves the
containing block. This allows for asynchronous cleanup, such as a database transaction performing a rollback or commit,
or a file stream flushing any pending writes to storage before it is closed.

As with `await`, `await using` can only be used in an `async` function or method, or at the top level of a module.

### Defining an asynchronously disposable resource

Just as `using` relies on objects that are `Disposable`, an `await using` relies on objects that are `AsyncDisposable`:



```id
ts// from the default lib:interface AsyncDisposable {  [Symbol.asyncDispose]: PromiseLike<void>;}// usage:class DatabaseTransaction implements AsyncDisposable {  public success = false;  private db: Database | undefined;  private constructor(db: Database) {    this.db = db;  }  static async create(db: Database) {    await db.execAsync("BEGIN TRANSACTION");    return new DatabaseTransaction(db);  }  async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {    if (this.db) {      const db = this.db:      this.db = undefined;      if (this.success) {        await db.execAsync("COMMIT TRANSACTION");      }      else {        await db.execAsync("ROLLBACK TRANSACTION");      }    }  }}async function transfer(db: Database, account1: Account, account2: Account, amount: number) {  using tx = await DatabaseTransaction.create(db);  if (await debitAccount(db, account1, amount)) {    await creditAccount(db, account2, amount);  }  // if an exception is thrown before this line, the transaction will roll back  tx.success = true;  // now the transaction will commit}
```



### `await using` vs `await`

The `await` keyword that is part of the `await using` declaration only indicates that the disposal of the resource is
`await`-ed. It does not `await` the value itself:



```id
ts{  await using x = getResourceSynchronously();} // performs `await x[Symbol.asyncDispose]()`{  await using y = await getResourceAsynchronously();} // performs `await y[Symbol.asyncDispose]()`
```



### `await using` and `return`

It’s important to note that there is a small caveat with this behavior if you are using an `await using` declaration in
an `async` function that returns a `Promise` without first `await`-ing it:



```id
tsfunction g() {  return Promise.reject("error!");}async function f() {  await using x = new C();  return g(); // missing an `await`}
```



Because the returned promise isn’t `await`-ed, it’s possible that the JavaScript runtime may report an unhandled
rejection since execution pauses while `await`-ing the asynchronous disposal of `x`, without having subscribed to the
returned promise. This is not a problem that is unique to `await using`, however, as this can also occur in an `async`
function that uses `try..finally`:



```id
tsasync function f() {  try {    return g(); // also reports an unhandled rejection  }  finally {    await somethingElse();  }}
```



To avoid this situation, it is recommended that you `await` your return value if it may be a `Promise`:



```id
tsasync function f() {  await using x = new C();  return await g();}
```



## `using` and `await using` in `for` and `for..of` statements

Both `using` and `await using` can be used in a `for` statement:



```id
tsfor (using x = getReader(); !x.eof; x.next()) {  // ...}
```



In this case, the lifetime of `x` is scoped to the entire `for` statement and is only disposed when control leaves the
loop due to `break`, `return`, `throw`, or when the loop condition is false.

In addition to `for` statements, both declarations can also be used in `for..of` statements:



```id
tsfunction * g() {  yield createResource1();  yield createResource2();}for (using x of g()) {  // ...}
```



Here, `x` is disposed at the end of each iteration of the loop , and is then reinitialized with the next value. This is
especially useful when consuming resources produced one at a time by a generator.

## `using` and `await using` in older runtimes

`using` and `await using` declarations can be used when targeting older ECMAScript editions as long as you are using
a compatible polyfill for `Symbol.dispose`/`Symbol.asyncDispose`, such as the one provided by default in recent
editions of NodeJS.

# DOM Manipulation

 

## DOM Manipulation

### An exploration into the `HTMLElement` type 

In the 20+ years since its standardization, JavaScript has come a very long way. While in 2020, JavaScript can be used on servers, in data science, and even on IoT devices, it is important to remember its most popular use case: web browsers.

Websites are made up of HTML and/or XML documents. These documents are static, they do not change. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface implemented by browsers to make static websites functional. The DOM API can be used to change the document structure, style, and content. The API is so powerful that countless frontend frameworks (jQuery, React, Angular, etc.) have been developed around it to make dynamic websites even easier to develop.

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, and it ships type definitions for the DOM API. These definitions are readily available in any default TypeScript project. Of the 20,000+ lines of definitions in lib.dom.d.ts , one stands out among the rest: `HTMLElement`. This type is the backbone for DOM manipulation with TypeScript.

 

You can explore the source code for the DOM type definitions 

 

## Basic Example

Given a simplified index.html file:



```id
html<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">  <head><title>TypeScript Dom Manipulation</title></head>  <body>    <div id="app"></div>    <!-- Assume index.js is the compiled output of index.ts -->    <script src="index.js"></script>  </body></html>
```



Let’s explore a TypeScript script that adds a ` Hello, World!

` element to the `#app` element. 


```id
ts// 1. Select the div element using the id propertyconst app = document.getElementById("app");// 2. Create a new <p></p> element programmaticallyconst p = document.createElement("p");// 3. Add the text contentp.textContent = "Hello, World!";// 4. Append the p element to the div elementapp?.appendChild(p);
```



After compiling and running the index.html page, the resulting HTML will be:



```id
html<div id="app">  <p>Hello, World!</p></div>
```



## The `Document` Interface

The first line of the TypeScript code uses a global variable `document`. Inspecting the variable shows it is defined by the `Document` interface from the lib.dom.d.ts file. The code snippet contains calls to two methods, `getElementById` and `createElement`.

### `Document.getElementById`

The definition for this method is as follows:



```id
tsgetElementById(elementId: string): HTMLElement | null;
```



Pass it an element id string and it will return either `HTMLElement` or `null`. This method introduces one of the most important types, `HTMLElement`. It serves as the base interface for every other element interface. For example, the `p` variable in the code example is of type `HTMLParagraphElement`. Also, take note that this method can return `null`. This is because the method can’t be certain pre-runtime if it will be able to actually find the specified element or not. In the last line of the code snippet, the new optional chaining operator is used to call `appendChild`.

### `Document.createElement`

The definition for this method is (I have omitted the deprecated definition):



```id
tscreateElement<K extends keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap>(tagName: K, options?: ElementCreationOptions): HTMLElementTagNameMap[K];createElement(tagName: string, options?: ElementCreationOptions): HTMLElement;
```



This is an overloaded function definition. The second overload is simplest and works a lot like the `getElementById` method does. Pass it any `string` and it will return a standard HTMLElement. This definition is what enables developers to create unique HTML element tags.

For example `document.createElement('xyz')` returns a ` ` element, clearly not an element that is specified by the HTML specification.

 

For those interested, you can interact with custom tag elements using the `document.getElementsByTagName`

 

For the first definition of `createElement`, it is using some advanced generic patterns. It is best understood broken down into chunks, starting with the generic expression: ` `. This expression defines a generic parameter `K` that is constrained to the keys of the interface `HTMLElementTagNameMap`. The map interface contains every specified HTML tag name and its corresponding type interface. For example here are the first 5 mapped values:



```id
tsinterface HTMLElementTagNameMap {    "a": HTMLAnchorElement;    "abbr": HTMLElement;    "address": HTMLElement;    "applet": HTMLAppletElement;    "area": HTMLAreaElement;        ...}
```



Some elements do not exhibit unique properties and so they just return `HTMLElement`, but other types do have unique properties and methods so they return their specific interface (which will extend from or implement `HTMLElement`).

Now, for the remainder of the `createElement` definition: 

```
(tagName: K, options?: ElementCreationOptions): HTMLElementTagNameMap[K]
```

. The first argument `tagName` is defined as the generic parameter `K`. The TypeScript interpreter is smart enough to infer the generic parameter from this argument. This means that the developer does not have to specify the generic parameter when using the method; whatever value is passed to the `tagName` argument will be inferred as `K` and thus can be used throughout the remainder of the definition. This is exactly what happens; the return value `HTMLElementTagNameMap[K]` takes the `tagName` argument and uses it to return the corresponding type. This definition is how the `p` variable from the code snippet gets a type of `HTMLParagraphElement`. And if the code was `document.createElement('a')`, then it would be an element of type `HTMLAnchorElement`.

## The `Node` interface

The `document.getElementById` function returns an `HTMLElement`. `HTMLElement` interface extends the `Element` interface which extends the `Node` interface. This prototypal extension allows for all `HTMLElements` to utilize a subset of standard methods. In the code snippet, we use a property defined on the `Node` interface to append the new `p` element to the website.

### `Node.appendChild`

The last line of the code snippet is `app?.appendChild(p)`. The previous, `document.getElementById`, section detailed that the optional chaining operator is used here because `app` can potentially be null at runtime. The `appendChild` method is defined by:



```id
tsappendChild<T extends Node>(newChild: T): T;
```



This method works similarly to the `createElement` method as the generic parameter `T` is inferred from the `newChild` argument. `T` is constrained to another base interface `Node`.

## Difference between `children` and `childNodes`

Previously, this document details the `HTMLElement` interface extends from `Element` which extends from `Node`. In the DOM API there is a concept of children elements. For example in the following HTML, the `p` tags are children of the `div` element



```id
tsx<div>  <p>Hello, World</p>  <p>TypeScript!</p></div>;const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0];div.children;// HTMLCollection(2) [p, p]div.childNodes;// NodeList(2) [p, p]
```



After capturing the `div` element, the `children` prop will return an `HTMLCollection` list containing the `HTMLParagraphElements`. The `childNodes` property will return a similar `NodeList` list of nodes. Each `p` tag will still be of type `HTMLParagraphElements`, but the `NodeList` can contain additional HTML nodes that the `HTMLCollection` list cannot.

Modify the HTML by removing one of the `p` tags, but keep the text.



```id
tsx<div>  <p>Hello, World</p>  TypeScript!</div>;const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0];div.children;// HTMLCollection(1) [p]div.childNodes;// NodeList(2) [p, text]
```



See how both lists change. `children` now only contains the ` Hello, World

` element, and the `childNodes` contains a `text` node rather than two `p` nodes. The `text` part of the `NodeList` is the literal `Node` containing the text `TypeScript!`. The `children` list does not contain this `Node` because it is not considered an `HTMLElement`. 

## The `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` methods

Both of these methods are great tools for getting lists of dom elements that fit a more unique set of constraints. They are defined in lib.dom.d.ts as:



```id
ts/** * Returns the first element that is a descendant of node that matches selectors. */querySelector<K extends keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap>(selectors: K): HTMLElementTagNameMap[K] | null;querySelector<K extends keyof SVGElementTagNameMap>(selectors: K): SVGElementTagNameMap[K] | null;querySelector<E extends Element = Element>(selectors: string): E | null;/** * Returns all element descendants of node that match selectors. */querySelectorAll<K extends keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap>(selectors: K): NodeListOf<HTMLElementTagNameMap[K]>;querySelectorAll<K extends keyof SVGElementTagNameMap>(selectors: K): NodeListOf<SVGElementTagNameMap[K]>;querySelectorAll<E extends Element = Element>(selectors: string): NodeListOf<E>;
```



The `querySelectorAll` definition is similar to `getElementsByTagName`, except it returns a new type: `NodeListOf`. This return type is essentially a custom implementation of the standard JavaScript list element. Arguably, replacing `NodeListOf ` with `E[]` would result in a very similar user experience. `NodeListOf` only implements the following properties and methods: `length`, `item(index)`, `forEach((value, key, parent) => void)`, and numeric indexing. Additionally, this method returns a list of elements , not nodes , which is what `NodeList` was returning from the `.childNodes` method. While this may appear as a discrepancy, take note that interface `Element` extends from `Node`.

To see these methods in action modify the existing code to:



```id
tsx<ul>  <li>First :)</li>  <li>Second!</li>  <li>Third times a charm.</li></ul>;const first = document.querySelector("li"); // returns the first li elementconst all = document.querySelectorAll("li"); // returns the list of all li elements
```



## Interested in learning more?

The best part about the lib.dom.d.ts type definitions is that they are reflective of the types annotated in the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation site. For example, the `HTMLElement` interface is documented by this HTMLElement page on MDN. These pages list all available properties, methods, and sometimes even examples. Another great aspect of the pages is that they provide links to the corresponding standard documents. Here is the link to the W3C Recommendation for HTMLElement .

# Modules - Introduction

 

This document is divided into four sections:

 The first section develops the theory behind how TypeScript approaches modules. If you want to be able to write the correct module-related compiler options for any situation, reason about how to integrate TypeScript with other tools, or understand how TypeScript processes dependency packages, this is the place to start. While there are guides and reference pages on these topics, building an understanding of these fundamentals will make reading the guides easier, and give you a mental framework for dealing with real-world problems not specifically covered here.

- The guides show how to accomplish specific real-world tasks, starting with picking the right compilation settings for a new project. The guides are a good place to start both for beginners who want to get up and running as quickly as possible and for experts who already have a good grasp of the theory but want concrete guidance on a complicated task.

- The reference section provides a more detailed look at the syntaxes and configurations presented in previous sections.

- The appendices cover complicated topics that deserve additional explanation in more detail than the theory or reference sections allow.

# Migrating from JavaScript

 

TypeScript doesn’t exist in a vacuum.
It was built with the JavaScript ecosystem in mind, and a lot of JavaScript exists today.
Converting a JavaScript codebase over to TypeScript is, while somewhat tedious, usually not challenging.
In this tutorial, we’re going to look at how you might start out.
We assume you’ve read enough of the handbook to write new TypeScript code.

If you’re looking to convert a React project, we recommend looking at the React Conversion Guide first.

## Setting up your Directories

If you’re writing in plain JavaScript, it’s likely that you’re running your JavaScript directly,
where your `.js` files are in a `src`, `lib`, or `dist` directory, and then run as desired.

If that’s the case, the files that you’ve written are going to be used as inputs to TypeScript, and you’ll run the outputs it produces.
During our JS to TS migration, we’ll need to separate our input files to prevent TypeScript from overwriting them.
If your output files need to reside in a specific directory, then that will be your output directory.

You might also be running some intermediate steps on your JavaScript, such as bundling or using another transpiler like Babel.
In this case, you might already have a folder structure like this set up.

From this point on, we’re going to assume that your directory is set up something like this:



```
projectRoot├── src│   ├── file1.js│   └── file2.js├── built└── tsconfig.json
```



If you have a `tests` folder outside of your `src` directory, you might have one `tsconfig.json` in `src`, and one in `tests` as well.

## Writing a Configuration File

TypeScript uses a file called `tsconfig.json` for managing your project’s options, such as which files you want to include, and what sorts of checking you want to perform.
Let’s create a bare-bones one for our project:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "outDir": "./built",    "allowJs": true,    "target": "es5"  },  "include": ["./src/**/*"]}
```



Here we’re specifying a few things to TypeScript:

 Read in any files it understands in the `src` directory (with `include` ).

- Accept JavaScript files as inputs (with `allowJs` ).

- Emit all of the output files in `built` (with `outDir` ).

- Translate newer JavaScript constructs down to an older version like ECMAScript 5 (using `target` ).

At this point, if you try running `tsc` at the root of your project, you should see output files in the `built` directory.
The layout of files in `built` should look identical to the layout of `src`.
You should now have TypeScript working with your project.

## Early Benefits

Even at this point you can get some great benefits from TypeScript understanding your project.
If you open up an editor like VS Code or Visual Studio , you’ll see that you can often get some tooling support like completion.
You can also catch certain bugs with options like:

- `noImplicitReturns` which prevents you from forgetting to return at the end of a function.

- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` which is helpful if you never want to forget a `break` statement between `case`s in a `switch` block.

TypeScript will also warn about unreachable code and labels, which you can disable with `allowUnreachableCode` and `allowUnusedLabels` respectively.

## Integrating with Build Tools

You might have some more build steps in your pipeline.
Perhaps you concatenate something to each of your files.
Each build tool is different, but we’ll do our best to cover the gist of things.

### Gulp

If you’re using Gulp in some fashion, we have a tutorial on using Gulp with TypeScript, and integrating with common build tools like Browserify, Babelify, and Uglify.
You can read more there.

### Webpack

Webpack integration is pretty simple.
You can use `ts-loader`, a TypeScript loader, combined with `source-map-loader` for easier debugging.
Simply run



```id
shellnpm install ts-loader source-map-loader
```



and merge in options from the following into your `webpack.config.js` file:



```id
jsmodule.exports = {  entry: "./src/index.ts",  output: {    filename: "./dist/bundle.js",  },  // Enable sourcemaps for debugging webpack's output.  devtool: "source-map",  resolve: {    // Add '.ts' and '.tsx' as resolvable extensions.    extensions: ["", ".webpack.js", ".web.js", ".ts", ".tsx", ".js"],  },  module: {    rules: [      // All files with a '.ts' or '.tsx' extension will be handled by 'ts-loader'.      { test: /\.tsx?$/, loader: "ts-loader" },      // All output '.js' files will have any sourcemaps re-processed by 'source-map-loader'.      { test: /\.js$/, loader: "source-map-loader" },    ],  },  // Other options...};
```



It’s important to note that ts-loader will need to run before any other loader that deals with `.js` files.

You can see an example of using Webpack in our tutorial on React and Webpack .

## Moving to TypeScript Files

At this point, you’re probably ready to start using TypeScript files.
The first step is to rename one of your `.js` files to `.ts`.
If your file uses JSX, you’ll need to rename it to `.tsx`.

Finished with that step?
Great!
You’ve successfully migrated a file from JavaScript to TypeScript!

Of course, that might not feel right.
If you open that file in an editor with TypeScript support (or if you run `tsc --pretty`), you might see red squiggles on certain lines.
You should think of these the same way you’d think of red squiggles in an editor like Microsoft Word.
TypeScript will still translate your code, just like Word will still let you print your documents.

If that sounds too lax for you, you can tighten that behavior up.
If, for instance, you don’t want TypeScript to compile to JavaScript in the face of errors, you can use the `noEmitOnError` option.
In that sense, TypeScript has a dial on its strictness, and you can turn that knob up as high as you want.

If you plan on using the stricter settings that are available, it’s best to turn them on now (see Getting Stricter Checks below).
For instance, if you never want TypeScript to silently infer `any` for a type without you explicitly saying so, you can use `noImplicitAny` before you start modifying your files.
While it might feel somewhat overwhelming, the long-term gains become apparent much more quickly.

### Weeding out Errors

Like we mentioned, it’s not unexpected to get error messages after conversion.
The important thing is to actually go one by one through these and decide how to deal with the errors.
Often these will be legitimate bugs, but sometimes you’ll have to explain what you’re trying to do a little better to TypeScript.

#### Importing from Modules

You might start out getting a bunch of errors like `Cannot find name 'require'.`, and `Cannot find name 'define'.`.
In these cases, it’s likely that you’re using modules.
While you can just convince TypeScript that these exist by writing out



```id
ts// For Node/CommonJSdeclare function require(path: string): any;
```



or



```id
ts// For RequireJS/AMDdeclare function define(...args: any[]): any;
```



it’s better to get rid of those calls and use TypeScript syntax for imports.

First, you’ll need to enable some module system by setting TypeScript’s `module` option.
Valid options are `commonjs`, `amd`, `system`, and `umd`.

If you had the following Node/CommonJS code:



```id
jsvar foo = require("foo");foo.doStuff();
```



or the following RequireJS/AMD code:



```id
jsdefine(["foo"], function (foo) {  foo.doStuff();});
```



then you would write the following TypeScript code:



```id
tsimport foo = require("foo");foo.doStuff();
```



#### Getting Declaration Files

If you started converting over to TypeScript imports, you’ll probably run into errors like `Cannot find module 'foo'.`.
The issue here is that you likely don’t have declaration files to describe your library.
Luckily this is pretty easy.
If TypeScript complains about a package like `lodash`, you can just write



```id
shellnpm install -S @types/lodash
```



If you’re using a module option other than `commonjs`, you’ll need to set your `moduleResolution` option to `node`.

After that, you’ll be able to import lodash with no issues, and get accurate completions.

#### Exporting from Modules

Typically, exporting from a module involves adding properties to a value like `exports` or `module.exports`.
TypeScript allows you to use top-level export statements.
For instance, if you exported a function like so:



```id
jsmodule.exports.feedPets = function (pets) {  // ...};
```



you could write that out as the following:



```id
tsexport function feedPets(pets) {  // ...}
```



Sometimes you’ll entirely overwrite the exports object.
This is a common pattern people use to make their modules immediately callable like in this snippet:



```id
jsvar express = require("express");var app = express();
```



You might have previously written that like so:



```id
jsfunction foo() {  // ...}module.exports = foo;
```



In TypeScript, you can model this with the `export =` construct.



```id
tsfunction foo() {  // ...}export = foo;
```



#### Too many/too few arguments

You’ll sometimes find yourself calling a function with too many/few arguments.
Typically, this is a bug, but in some cases, you might have declared a function that uses the `arguments` object instead of writing out any parameters:



```id
jsfunction myCoolFunction() {  if (arguments.length == 2 && !Array.isArray(arguments[1])) {    var f = arguments[0];    var arr = arguments[1];    // ...  }  // ...}myCoolFunction(  function (x) {    console.log(x);  },  [1, 2, 3, 4]);myCoolFunction(  function (x) {    console.log(x);  },  1,  2,  3,  4);
```



In this case, we need to use TypeScript to tell any of our callers about the ways `myCoolFunction` can be called using function overloads.



```id
tsfunction myCoolFunction(f: (x: number) => void, nums: number[]): void;function myCoolFunction(f: (x: number) => void, ...nums: number[]): void;function myCoolFunction() {  if (arguments.length == 2 && !Array.isArray(arguments[1])) {    var f = arguments[0];    var arr = arguments[1];    // ...  }  // ...}
```



We added two overload signatures to `myCoolFunction`.
The first checks states that `myCoolFunction` takes a function (which takes a `number`), and then a list of `number`s.
The second one says that it will take a function as well, and then uses a rest parameter (`...nums`) to state that any number of arguments after that need to be `number`s.

#### Sequentially Added Properties

Some people find it more aesthetically pleasing to create an object and add properties immediately after like so:



```id
jsvar options = {};options.color = "red";options.volume = 11;
```



TypeScript will say that you can’t assign to `color` and `volume` because it first figured out the type of `options` as `{}` which doesn’t have any properties.
If you instead moved the declarations into the object literal themselves, you’d get no errors:



```id
tslet options = {  color: "red",  volume: 11,};
```



You could also define the type of `options` and add a type assertion on the object literal.



```id
tsinterface Options {  color: string;  volume: number;}let options = {} as Options;options.color = "red";options.volume = 11;
```



Alternatively, you can just say `options` has the type `any` which is the easiest thing to do, but which will benefit you the least.

#### `any`, `Object`, and `{}`

You might be tempted to use `Object` or `{}` to say that a value can have any property on it because `Object` is, for most purposes, the most general type.
However `any` is actually the type you want to use in those situations, since it’s the most flexible type.

For instance, if you have something that’s typed as `Object` you won’t be able to call methods like `toLowerCase()` on it.
Being more general usually means you can do less with a type, but `any` is special in that it is the most general type while still allowing you to do anything with it.
That means you can call it, construct it, access properties on it, etc.
Keep in mind though, whenever you use `any`, you lose out on most of the error checking and editor support that TypeScript gives you.

If a decision ever comes down to `Object` and `{}`, you should prefer `{}`.
While they are mostly the same, technically `{}` is a more general type than `Object` in certain esoteric cases.

### Getting Stricter Checks

TypeScript comes with certain checks to give you more safety and analysis of your program.
Once you’ve converted your codebase to TypeScript, you can start enabling these checks for greater safety.

#### No Implicit `any`

There are certain cases where TypeScript can’t figure out what certain types should be.
To be as lenient as possible, it will decide to use the type `any` in its place.
While this is great for migration, using `any` means that you’re not getting any type safety, and you won’t get the same tooling support you’d get elsewhere.
You can tell TypeScript to flag these locations down and give an error with the `noImplicitAny` option.

#### Strict `null` & `undefined` Checks

By default, TypeScript assumes that `null` and `undefined` are in the domain of every type.
That means anything declared with the type `number` could be `null` or `undefined`.
Since `null` and `undefined` are such a frequent source of bugs in JavaScript and TypeScript, TypeScript has the `strictNullChecks` option to spare you the stress of worrying about these issues.

When `strictNullChecks` is enabled, `null` and `undefined` get their own types called `null` and `undefined` respectively.
Whenever anything is possibly `null`, you can use a union type with the original type.
So for instance, if something could be a `number` or `null`, you’d write the type out as `number | null`.

If you ever have a value that TypeScript thinks is possibly `null`/`undefined`, but you know better, you can use the postfix `!` operator to tell it otherwise.



```id
tsdeclare var foo: string[] | null;foo.length; // error - 'foo' is possibly 'null'foo!.length; // okay - 'foo!' just has type 'string[]'
```



As a heads up, when using `strictNullChecks` , your dependencies may need to be updated to use `strictNullChecks` as well.

#### No Implicit `any` for `this`

When you use the `this` keyword outside of classes, it has the type `any` by default.
For instance, imagine a `Point` class, and imagine a function that we wish to add as a method:



```id
tsclass Point {  constructor(public x, public y) {}  getDistance(p: Point) {    let dx = p.x - this.x;    let dy = p.y - this.y;    return Math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2);  }}// ...// Reopen the interface.interface Point {  distanceFromOrigin(): number;}Point.prototype.distanceFromOrigin = function () {  return this.getDistance({ x: 0, y: 0 });};
```



This has the same problems we mentioned above - we could easily have misspelled `getDistance` and not gotten an error.
For this reason, TypeScript has the `noImplicitThis` option.
When that option is set, TypeScript will issue an error when `this` is used without an explicit (or inferred) type.
The fix is to use a `this`-parameter to give an explicit type in the interface or in the function itself:



```id
tsPoint.prototype.distanceFromOrigin = function (this: Point) {  return this.getDistance({ x: 0, y: 0 });};
```

# Modules - Theory

 

## Scripts and modules in JavaScript

In the early days of JavaScript, when the language only ran in browsers, there were no modules, but it was still possible to split the JavaScript for a web page into multiple files by using multiple `script` tags in HTML:



```id
html<html>  <head>    <script src="a.js"></script>    <script src="b.js"></script>  </head>  <body></body></html>
```



This approach had some downsides, especially as web pages grew larger and more complex. In particular, all scripts loaded onto the same page share the same scope—appropriately called the “global scope”—meaning the scripts had to be very careful not to overwrite each others’ variables and functions.

Any system that solves this problem by giving files their own scope while still providing a way to make bits of code available to other files can be called a “module system.” (It may sound obvious to say that each file in a module system is called a “module,” but the term is often used to contrast with script files, which run outside a module system, in a global scope.)

 

There are many module systems , and TypeScript supports emitting several , but this documentation will focus on the two most important systems today: ECMAScript modules (ESM) and CommonJS (CJS).

ECMAScript Modules (ESM) is the module system built into the language, supported in modern browsers and in Node.js since v12. It uses dedicated `import` and `export` syntax:



```id
js// a.jsexport default "Hello from a.js";
```




```id
js// b.jsimport a from "./a.js";console.log(a); // 'Hello from a.js'
```



CommonJS (CJS) is the module system that originally shipped in Node.js, before ESM was part of the language specification. It’s still supported in Node.js alongside ESM. It uses plain JavaScript objects and functions named `exports` and `require`:



```id
js// a.jsexports.message = "Hello from a.js";
```




```id
js// b.jsconst a = require("./a");console.log(a.message); // 'Hello from a.js'
```


 

Accordingly, when TypeScript detects that a file is a CommonJS or ECMAScript module, it starts by assuming that file will have its own scope. Beyond that, though, the compiler’s job gets a little more complicated.

## TypeScript’s job concerning modules

The TypeScript compiler’s chief goal is to prevent certain kinds of runtime errors by catching them at compile time. With or without modules involved, the compiler needs to know about the code’s intended runtime environment—what globals are available, for example. When modules are involved, there are several additional questions the compiler needs to answer in order to do its job. Let’s use a few lines of input code as an example to think about all the information needed to analyze it:



```id
tsimport sayHello from "greetings";sayHello("world");
```



To check this file, the compiler needs to know the type of `sayHello` (is it a function that can accept one string argument?), which opens quite a few additional questions:

 Will the module system load this TypeScript file directly, or will it load a JavaScript file that I (or another compiler) generate from this TypeScript file?

- What kind of module does the module system expect to find, given the file name it will load and its location on disk?

- If output JavaScript is being emitted, how will the module syntax present in this file be transformed in the output code?

- Where will the module system look to find the module specified by `"greetings"`? Will the lookup succeed?

- What kind of module is the file resolved by that lookup?

- Does the module system allow the kind of module detected in (2) to reference the kind of module detected in (5) with the syntax decided in (3)?

- Once the `"greetings"` module has been analyzed, what piece of that module is bound to `sayHello`?

Notice that all of these questions depend on characteristics of the host —the system that ultimately consumes the output JavaScript (or raw TypeScript, as the case may be) to direct its module loading behavior, typically either a runtime (like Node.js) or bundler (like Webpack).

The ECMAScript specification defines how ESM imports and exports link up with each other, but it doesn’t specify how the file lookup in (4), known as module resolution , happens, and it doesn’t say anything about other module systems like CommonJS. So runtimes and bundlers, especially those that want to support both ESM and CJS, have a lot of freedom to design their own rules. Consequently, the way TypeScript should answer the questions above can vary dramatically depending on where the code is intended to run. There’s no single right answer, so the compiler must be told the rules through configuration options.

The other key idea to keep in mind is that TypeScript almost always thinks about these questions in terms of its output JavaScript files, not its input TypeScript (or JavaScript!) files. Today, some runtimes and bundlers support loading TypeScript files directly, and in those cases, it doesn’t make sense to think about separate input and output files. Most of this document discusses cases where TypeScript files are compiled to JavaScript files, which in turn are loaded by the runtime module system. Examining these cases is essential for building an understanding of the compiler’s options and behavior—it’s easier to start there and simplify when thinking about esbuild, Bun, and other TypeScript-first runtimes and bundlers . So for now, we can summarize TypeScript’s job when it comes to modules in terms of output files:

Understand the rules of the host enough

- to compile files into a valid output module format ,

- to ensure that imports in those outputs will resolve successfully , and

- to know what type to assign to imported names .

## Who is the host?

Before we move on, it’s worth making sure we’re on the same page about the term host , because it will come up frequently. We defined it before as “the system that ultimately consumes the output code to direct its module loading behavior.” In other words, it’s the system outside of TypeScript that TypeScript’s module analysis tries to model:

- When the output code (whether produced by `tsc` or a third-party transpiler) is run directly in a runtime like Node.js, the runtime is the host.

- When there is no “output code” because a runtime consumes TypeScript files directly, the runtime is still the host.

- When a bundler consumes TypeScript inputs or outputs and produces a bundle, the bundler is the host, because it looked at the original set of imports/requires, looked up what files they referenced, and produced a new file or set of files where the original imports and requires are erased or transformed beyond recognition. (That bundle itself might comprise modules, and the runtime that runs it will be its host, but TypeScript doesn’t know about anything that happens post-bundler.)

- If another transpiler, optimizer, or formatter runs on TypeScript’s outputs, it’s not a host that TypeScript cares about, as long as it leaves the imports and exports it sees alone.

- When loading modules in a web browser, the behaviors TypeScript needs to model are actually split between the web server and the module system running in the browser. The browser’s JavaScript engine (or a script-based module-loading framework like RequireJS) controls what module formats are accepted, while the web server decides what file to send when one module triggers a request to load another.

- The TypeScript compiler itself is not a host, because it does not provide any behavior related to modules beyond trying to model other hosts.

## The module output format

In any project, the first question about modules we need to answer is what kinds of modules the host expects, so TypeScript can set its output format for each file to match. Sometimes, the host only supports one kind of module—ESM in the browser, or CJS in Node.js v11 and earlier, for example. Node.js v12 and later accepts both CJS and ES modules, but uses file extensions and `package.json` files to determine what format each file should be, and throws an error if the file’s contents don’t match the expected format.

The `module` compiler option provides this information to the compiler. Its primary purpose is to control the module format of any JavaScript that gets emitted during compilation, but it also serves to inform the compiler about how the module kind of each file should be detected, how different module kinds are allowed to import each other, and whether features like `import.meta` and top-level `await` are available. So, even if a TypeScript project is using `noEmit`, choosing the right setting for `module` still matters. As we established earlier, the compiler needs an accurate understanding of the module system so it can type check (and provide IntelliSense for) imports. See Choosing compiler options for guidance on choosing the right `module` setting for your project.

The available `module` settings are

- `node16` : Reflects the module system of Node.js v16+, which supports ES modules and CJS modules side-by-side with particular interoperability and detection rules.

- `node18` : Reflects the module system of Node.js v18+, which adds support for import attributes.

- `nodenext` : A moving target reflecting the latest Node.js versions as Node.js’s module system evolves. As of TypeScript 5.8, `nodenext` supports `require` of ECMAScript modules.

- `es2015` : Reflects the ES2015 language specification for JavaScript modules (the version that first introduced `import` and `export` to the language).

- `es2020` : Adds support for `import.meta` and `export * as ns from "mod"` to `es2015`.

- `es2022` : Adds support for top-level `await` to `es2020`.

- `esnext` : Currently identical to `es2022`, but will be a moving target reflecting the latest ECMAScript specifications, as well as module-related Stage 3+ proposals that are expected to be included in upcoming specification versions.

- `commonjs` , `system` , `amd` , and `umd` : Each emits everything in the module system named, and assumes everything can be successfully imported into that module system. These are no longer recommended for new projects and will not be covered in detail by this documentation.

 

Node.js’s rules for module format detection and interoperability make it incorrect to specify `module` as `esnext` or `commonjs` for projects that run in Node.js, even if all files emitted by `tsc` are ESM or CJS, respectively. The only correct `module` settings for projects that intend to run in Node.js are `node16` and `nodenext`. While the emitted JavaScript for an all-ESM Node.js project might look identical between compilations using `esnext` and `nodenext`, the type checking can differ. See the reference section on `nodenext` for more details.

 

### Module format detection

Node.js understands both ES modules and CJS modules, but the format of each file is determined by its file extension and the `type` field of the first `package.json` file found in a search of the file’s directory and all ancestor directories:

- `.mjs` and `.cjs` files are always interpreted as ES modules and CJS modules, respectively.

- `.js` files are interpreted as ES modules if the nearest `package.json` file contains a `type` field with the value `"module"`. If there is no `package.json` file, or if the `type` field is missing or has any other value, `.js` files are interpreted as CJS modules.

If a file is determined to be an ES module by these rules, Node.js will not inject the CommonJS `module` and `require` objects into the file’s scope during evaluation, so a file that tries to use them will cause a crash. Conversely, if a file is determined to be a CJS module, `import` and `export` declarations in the file will cause a syntax error crash.

When the `module` compiler option is set to `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext`, TypeScript applies this same algorithm to the project’s input files to determine the module kind of each corresponding output file. Let’s look at how module formats are detected in an example project that uses `--module nodenext`:

 
 
 
 Input file name 
 Contents 
 Output file name 
 Module kind 
 Reason 
 
 
 
 
 `/package.json` 
 `{}` 
 
 
 
 
 
 `/main.mts` 
 
 `/main.mjs` 
 ESM 
 File extension 
 
 
 `/utils.cts` 
 
 `/utils.cjs` 
 CJS 
 File extension 
 
 
 `/example.ts` 
 
 `/example.js` 
 CJS 
 No `"type": "module"` in `package.json` 
 
 
 `/node_modules/pkg/package.json` 
 `{ "type": "module" }` 
 
 
 
 
 
 `/node_modules/pkg/index.d.ts` 
 
 
 ESM 
 `"type": "module"` in `package.json` 
 
 
 `/node_modules/pkg/index.d.cts` 
 
 
 CJS 
 File extension 
 
 
 

When the input file extension is `.mts` or `.cts`, TypeScript knows to treat that file as an ES module or CJS module, respectively, because Node.js will treat the output `.mjs` file as an ES module or the output `.cjs` file as a CJS module. When the input file extension is `.ts`, TypeScript has to consult the nearest `package.json` file to determine the module format, because this is what Node.js will do when it encounters the output `.js` file. (Notice that the same rules apply to the `.d.cts` and `.d.ts` declaration files in the `pkg` dependency: though they will not produce an output file as part of this compilation, the presence of a `.d.ts` file implies the existence of a corresponding `.js` file—perhaps created when the author of the `pkg` library ran `tsc` on an input `.ts` file of their own—which Node.js must interpret as an ES module, due to its `.js` extension and the presence of the `"type": "module"` field in `/node_modules/pkg/package.json`. Declaration files are covered in more detail in a later section .)

The detected module format of input files is used by TypeScript to ensure it emits the output syntax that Node.js expects in each output file. If TypeScript were to emit `/example.js` with `import` and `export` statements in it, Node.js would crash when parsing the file. If TypeScript were to emit `/main.mjs` with `require` calls, Node.js would crash during evaluation. Beyond emit, the module format is also used to determine rules for type checking and module resolution, which we’ll discuss in the following sections.

As of TypeScript 5.6, other `--module` modes (like `esnext` and `commonjs`) also respect format-specific file extensions (`.mts` and `.cts`) as a file-level override for the emit format. For example, a file named `main.mts` will emit ESM syntax into `main.mjs` even if `--module` is set to `commonjs`.

It’s worth mentioning again that TypeScript’s behavior in `--module node16`, `--module node18`, and `--module nodenext` is entirely motivated by Node.js’s behavior. Since TypeScript’s goal is to catch potential runtime errors at compile time, it needs a very accurate model of what will happen at runtime. This fairly complex set of rules for module kind detection is necessary for checking code that will run in Node.js, but may be overly strict or just incorrect if applied to non-Node.js hosts.

### Input module syntax

It’s important to note that the input module syntax seen in input source files is somewhat decoupled from the output module syntax emitted to JS files. That is, a file with an ESM import:



```id
tsimport { sayHello } from "greetings";sayHello("world");
```



might be emitted in ESM format exactly as-is, or might be emitted as CommonJS:



```id
tsObject.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });const greetings_1 = require("greetings");(0, greetings_1.sayHello)("world");
```



depending on the `module` compiler option (and any applicable module format detection rules, if the `module` option supports more than one kind of module). In general, this means that looking at the contents of an input file isn’t enough to determine whether it’s an ES module or a CJS module.

 

Today, most TypeScript files are authored using ESM syntax (`import` and `export` statements) regardless of the output format. This is largely a legacy of the long road ESM has taken to widespread support. ECMAScript modules were standardized in 2015, were supported in most browsers by 2017, and landed in Node.js v12 in 2019. During much of this window, it was clear that ESM was the future of JavaScript modules, but very few runtimes could consume it. Tools like Babel made it possible for JavaScript to be authored in ESM and downleveled to another module format that could be used in Node.js or browsers. TypeScript followed suit, adding support for ES module syntax and softly discouraging the use of the original CommonJS-inspired `import fs = require("fs")` syntax in the 1.5 release .

The upside of this “author ESM, output anything” strategy was that TypeScript could use standard JavaScript syntax, making the authoring experience familiar to newcomers, and (theoretically) making it easy for projects to start targeting ESM outputs in the future. There are three significant downsides, which became fully apparent only after ESM and CJS modules were allowed to coexist and interoperate in Node.js:

- Early assumptions about how ESM/CJS interoperability would work in Node.js turned out to be wrong, and today, interoperability rules differ between Node.js and bundlers. Consequently, the configuration space for modules in TypeScript is large.

- When the syntax in input files all looks like ESM, it’s easy for an author or code reviewer to lose track of what kind of module a file is at runtime. And because of Node.js’s interoperability rules, what kind of module each file is became very important.

- When input files are written in ESM, the syntax in type declaration outputs (`.d.ts` files) looks like ESM too. But because the corresponding JavaScript files could have been emitted in any module format, TypeScript can’t tell what kind of module a file is just by looking at the contents of its type declarations. And again, because of the nature of ESM/CJS interoperability, TypeScript has to know what kind of module everything is in order to provide correct types and prevent imports that will crash.

In TypeScript 5.0, a new compiler option called `verbatimModuleSyntax` was introduced to help TypeScript authors know exactly how their `import` and `export` statements will be emitted. When enabled, the flag requires imports and exports in input files to be written in the form that will undergo the least amount of transformation before emit. So if a file will be emitted as ESM, imports and exports must be written in ESM syntax; if a file will be emitted as CJS, it must be written in the CommonJS-inspired TypeScript syntax (`import fs = require("fs")` and `export = {}`). This setting is particularly recommended for Node.js projects that use mostly ESM, but have a select few CJS files. It is not recommended for projects that currently target CJS, but may want to target ESM in the future.

 

### ESM and CJS interoperability

Can an ES module `import` a CommonJS module? If so, does a default import link to `exports` or `exports.default`? Can a CommonJS module `require` an ES module? CommonJS isn’t part of the ECMAScript specification, so runtimes, bundlers, and transpilers have been free to make up their own answers to these questions since ESM was standardized in 2015, and as such no standard set of interoperability rules exist. Today, most runtimes and bundlers broadly fall into one of three categories:

- ESM-only. Some runtimes, like browser engines, only support what’s actually a part of the language: ECMAScript Modules.

- Bundler-like. Before any major JavaScript engine could run ES modules, Babel allowed developers to write them by transpiling them to CommonJS. The way these ESM-transpiled-to-CJS files interacted with hand-written-CJS files implied a set of permissive interoperability rules that have become the de facto standard for bundlers and transpilers.

- Node.js. Until Node.js v20.19.0, CommonJS modules could not load ES modules synchronously (with `require`); they could only load them asynchronously with dynamic `import()` calls. ES modules can default-import CJS modules, which always binds to `exports`. (This means that a default import of a Babel-like CJS output with `__esModule` behaves differently between Node.js and some bundlers.)

TypeScript needs to know which of these rule sets to assume in order to provide correct types on (particularly `default`) imports and to error on imports that will crash at runtime. When the `module` compiler option is set to `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext`, Node.js’s version-specific rules are enforced. 1 All other `module` settings, combined with the `esModuleInterop` option, result in bundler-like interop in TypeScript. (While using `--module esnext` does prevent you from writing CommonJS modules, it does not prevent you from importing them as dependencies. There’s currently no TypeScript setting that can guard against an ES module importing a CommonJS module, as would be appropriate for direct-to-browser code.)

### Module specifiers are not transformed by default

While the `module` compiler option can transform imports and exports in input files to different module formats in output files, the module specifier (the string `from` which you `import`, or pass to `require`) is emitted as-written. For example, an input like:



```id
tsimport { add } from "./math.mjs";add(1, 2);
```



might be emitted as either:



```id
tsimport { add } from "./math.mjs";add(1, 2);
```



or:



```id
tsconst math_1 = require("./math.mjs");math_1.add(1, 2);
```



depending on the `module` compiler option, but the module specifier will be `"./math.mjs"` either way. By default, module specifiers must be written in a way that works for the code’s target runtime or bundler, and it’s TypeScript’s job to understand those output -relative specifiers. The process of finding the file referenced by a module specifier is called module resolution .

 

TypeScript 5.7 introduced the `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` option , which transforms relative module specifiers with `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, or `.cts` extensions to their JavaScript equivalents in output files. This option is useful for creating TypeScript files that can be run directly in Node.js during development and still be compiled to JavaScript outputs for distribution or production use.

This documentation was written before the introduction of `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`, and the mental model it presents is built around modeling the behavior of the host module system operating on its input files, whether that’s a bundler operating on TypeScript files or a runtime operating on `.js` outputs. With `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`, the way to apply that mental model is to apply it twice : once to the runtime or bundler processing the TypeScript input files directly, and once again to the runtime or bundler processing the transformed outputs. Most of this documentation assumes that only the input files or only the output files will be loaded, but the principles it presents can be extended to the case where both are loaded.

 

## Module resolution

Let’s return to our first example and review what we’ve learned about it so far:



```id
tsimport sayHello from "greetings";sayHello("world");
```



So far, we’ve discussed how the host’s module system and TypeScript’s `module` compiler option might impact this code. We know that the input syntax looks like ESM, but the output format depends on the `module` compiler option, potentially the file extension, and `package.json` `"type"` field. We also know that what `sayHello` gets bound to, and even whether the import is even allowed, may vary depending on the module kinds of this file and the target file. But we haven’t yet discussed how to find the target file.

### Module resolution is host-defined

While the ECMAScript specification defines how to parse and interpret `import` and `export` statements, it leaves module resolution up to the host. If you’re creating a hot new JavaScript runtime, you’re free to create a module resolution scheme like:



```id
tsimport monkey from "🐒"; // Looks for './eats/bananas.js'import cow from "🐄";    // Looks for './eats/grass.js'import lion from "🦁";   // Looks for './eats/you.js'
```



and still claim to implement “standards-compliant ESM.” Needless to say, TypeScript would have no idea what types to assign to `monkey`, `cow`, and `lion` without built-in knowledge of this runtime’s module resolution algorithm. Just as `module` informs the compiler about the host’s expected module format, `moduleResolution`, along with a few customization options, specify the algorithm the host uses to resolve module specifiers to files. This also clarifies why TypeScript doesn’t modify import specifiers during emit: the relationship between an import specifier and a file on disk (if one even exists) is host-defined, and TypeScript is not a host.

The available `moduleResolution` options are:

- `classic` : TypeScript’s oldest module resolution mode, this is unfortunately the default when `module` is set to anything other than `commonjs`, `node16`, or `nodenext`. It was probably made to provide best-effort resolution for a wide range of RequireJS configurations. It should not be used for new projects (or even old projects that don’t use RequireJS or another AMD module loader), and is scheduled for deprecation in TypeScript 6.0.

- `node10` : Formerly known as `node`, this is the unfortunate default when `module` is set to `commonjs`. It’s a pretty good model of Node.js versions older than v12, and sometimes it’s a passable approximation of how most bundlers do module resolution. It supports looking up packages from `node_modules`, loading directory `index.js` files, and omitting `.js` extensions in relative module specifiers. Because Node.js v12 introduced different module resolution rules for ES modules, though, it’s a very bad model of modern versions of Node.js. It should not be used for new projects.

- `node16` : This is the counterpart of `--module node16` and `--module node18` and is set by default with that `module` setting. Node.js v12 and later support both ESM and CJS, each of which uses its own module resolution algorithm. In Node.js, module specifiers in import statements and dynamic `import()` calls are not allowed to omit file extensions or `/index.js` suffixes, while module specifiers in `require` calls are. This module resolution mode understands and enforces this restriction where necessary, as determined by the module format detection rules instated by `--module node16`/`node18`. (For `node16` and `nodenext`, `module` and `moduleResolution` go hand-in-hand: setting one to `node16` or `nodenext` while setting the other to something else is an error.)

- `nodenext` : Currently identical to `node16`, this is the counterpart of `--module nodenext` and is set by default with that `module` setting. It’s intended to be a forward-looking mode that will support new Node.js module resolution features as they’re added.

- `bundler` : Node.js v12 introduced some new module resolution features for importing npm packages—the `"exports"` and `"imports"` fields of `package.json`—and many bundlers adopted those features without also adopting the stricter rules for ESM imports. This module resolution mode provides a base algorithm for code targeting a bundler. It supports `package.json` `"exports"` and `"imports"` by default, but can be configured to ignore them. It requires setting `module` to `esnext`.

### TypeScript imitates the host’s module resolution, but with types

Remember the three components of TypeScript’s job concerning modules?

- Compile files into a valid output module format 

- Ensure that imports in those outputs will resolve successfully 

- Know what type to assign to imported names .

Module resolution is needed to accomplish last two. But when we spend most of our time working in input files, it can be easy to forget about (2)—that a key component of module resolution is validating that the imports or `require` calls in the output files, containing the same module specifiers as the input files , will actually work at runtime. Let’s look at a new example with multiple files:



```id
ts// @Filename: math.tsexport function add(a: number, b: number) {  return a + b;}// @Filename: main.tsimport { add } from "./math";add(1, 2);
```



When we see the import from `"./math"`, it might be tempting to think, “This is how one TypeScript file refers to another. The compiler follows this (extensionless) path in order to assign a type to `add`.”

 

This isn’t entirely wrong, but the reality is deeper. The resolution of `"./math"` (and subsequently, the type of `add`) need to reflect the reality of what happens at runtime to the output files. A more robust way to think about this process would look like this:

 

This model makes it clear that for TypeScript, module resolution is mostly a matter of accurately modeling the host’s module resolution algorithm between output files, with a little bit of remapping applied to find type information. Let’s look at another example that appears unintuitive through the lens of the simple model, but makes perfect sense with the robust model:



```id
ts// @moduleResolution: node16// @rootDir: src// @outDir: dist// @Filename: src/math.mtsexport function add(a: number, b: number) {  return a + b;}// @Filename: src/main.mtsimport { add } from "./math.mjs";add(1, 2);
```



Node.js ESM `import` declarations use a strict module resolution algorithm that requires relative paths to include file extensions. When we only think about input files, it’s a little strange that `"./math.mjs"` seems to resolve to `math.mts`. Since we’re using an `outDir` to put compiled outputs in a different directory, `math.mjs` doesn’t even exist next to `main.mts`! Why should this resolve? With our new mental model, it’s no problem:

 

Understanding this mental model may not immediately eliminate the strangeness of seeing output file extensions in input files, and it’s natural to think in terms of shortcuts: `"./math.mjs"` refers to the input file `math.mts`. I have to write the output extension, but the compiler knows to look for `.mts` when I write `.mjs`. This shortcut is even how the compiler works internally, but the more robust mental model explains why module resolution in TypeScript works this way: given the constraint that the module specifier in the output file will be the same as the module specifier in the input file, this is the only process that accomplishes our two goals of validating output files and assigning types.

### The role of declaration files

In the previous example, we saw the “remapping” part of module resolution working between input and output files. But what happens when we import library code? Even if the library was written in TypeScript, it may not have published its source code. If we can’t rely on mapping the library’s JavaScript files back to a TypeScript file, we can verify that our import works at runtime, but how do we accomplish our second goal of assigning types?

This is where declaration files (`.d.ts`, `.d.mts`, etc.) come into play. The best way to understand how declaration files are interpreted is to understand where they come from. When you run `tsc --declaration` on an input file, you get one output JavaScript file and one output declaration file:

 

Because of this relationship, the compiler assumes that wherever it sees a declaration file, there is a corresponding JavaScript file that is perfectly described by the type information in the declaration file. For performance reasons, in every module resolution mode, the compiler always looks for TypeScript and declaration files first, and if it finds one, it doesn’t continue looking for the corresponding JavaScript file. If it finds a TypeScript input file, it knows a JavaScript file will exist after compilation, and if it finds a declaration file, it knows a compilation (perhaps someone else’s) already happened and created a JavaScript file at the same time as the declaration file.

The declaration file tells the compiler not only that a JavaScript file exists, but also what its name and extension are:

 
 
 
 Declaration file extension 
 JavaScript file extension 
 TypeScript file extension 
 
 
 
 
 `.d.ts` 
 `.js` 
 `.ts` 
 
 
 `.d.ts` 
 `.js` 
 `.tsx` 
 
 
 `.d.mts` 
 `.mjs` 
 `.mts` 
 
 
 `.d.cts` 
 `.cjs` 
 `.cts` 
 
 
 `.d.*.ts` 
 `.*` 
 
 
 
 

The last row expresses that non-JS files can be typed with the `allowArbitraryExtensions` compiler option to support cases where the module system supports importing non-JS files as JavaScript objects. For example, a file named `styles.css` can be represented by a declaration file named `styles.d.css.ts`.

 

“But wait! Plenty of declaration files are written by hand, not generated by `tsc`. Ever heard of DefinitelyTyped?” you might object. And it’s true—hand-writing declaration files, or even moving/copying/renaming them to represent outputs of an external build tool, is a dangerous, error-prone venture. DefinitelyTyped contributors and authors of typed libraries not using `tsc` to generate both JavaScript and declaration files should ensure that every JavaScript file has a sibling declaration file with the same name and matching extension. Breaking from this structure can lead to false-positive TypeScript errors for end users. The npm package `@arethetypeswrong/cli` can help catch and explain these errors before they’re published.

 

### Module resolution for bundlers, TypeScript runtimes, and Node.js loaders

So far, we’ve really emphasized the distinction between input files and output files . Recall that when specifying a file extension on a relative module specifier, TypeScript typically makes you use the output file extension :



```id
ts// @Filename: src/math.tsexport function add(a: number, b: number) {  return a + b;}// @Filename: src/main.tsimport { add } from "./math.ts";//                  ^^^^^^^^^^^// An import path can only end with a '.ts' extension when 'allowImportingTsExtensions' is enabled.
```



This restriction applies since TypeScript won’t rewrite the extension to `.js`, and if `"./math.ts"` appears in an output JS file, that import won’t resolve to another JS file at runtime. TypeScript really wants to prevent you from generating an unsafe output JS file. But what if there is no output JS file? What if you’re in one of these situations:

- You’re bundling this code, the bundler is configured to transpile TypeScript files in-memory, and it will eventually consume and erase all the imports you’ve written to produce a bundle.

- You’re running this code directly in a TypeScript runtime like Node, Deno or Bun.

- You’re using `ts-node`, `tsx`, or another transpiling loader for Node.

In these cases, you can turn on `noEmit` (or `emitDeclarationOnly`) and `allowImportingTsExtensions` to disable emitting unsafe JavaScript files and silence the error on `.ts`-extensioned imports.

With or without `allowImportingTsExtensions`, it’s still important to pick the most appropriate `moduleResolution` setting for the module resolution host. For bundlers and the Bun runtime, it’s `bundler`. These module resolvers were inspired by Node.js, but didn’t adopt the strict ESM resolution algorithm that disables extension searching that Node.js applies to imports. The `bundler` module resolution setting reflects this, enabling `package.json` `"exports"` support like `node16`—`nodenext`, while always allowing extensionless imports. See Choosing compiler options for more guidance.

### Module resolution for libraries

When compiling an app, you choose the `moduleResolution` option for a TypeScript project based on who the module resolution host is. When compiling a library, you don’t know where the output code will run, but you’d like it to run in as many places as possible. Using `"module": "node18"` (along with the implied `"moduleResolution": "node16"` ) is the best bet for maximizing the compatibility of the output JavaScript’s module specifiers, since it will force you to comply with Node.js’s stricter rules for `import` module resolution. Let’s look at what would happen if a library were to compile with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` (or worse, `"node10"`):



```id
tsexport * from "./utils";
```



Assuming `./utils.ts` (or `./utils/index.ts`) exists, a bundler would be fine with this code, so `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` doesn’t complain. Compiled with `"module": "esnext"`, the output JavaScript for this export statement will look exactly the same as the input. If that JavaScript were published to npm, it would be usable by projects that use a bundler, but it would cause an error when run in Node.js:



```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../node_modules/dependency/utils' imported from .../node_modules/dependency/index.jsDid you mean to import ./utils.js?
```



On the other hand, if we had written:



```id
tsexport * from "./utils.js";
```



This would produce output that works both in Node.js and in bundlers.

In short, `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` is infectious, allowing code that only works in bundlers to be produced. Likewise, `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` is only checking that the output works in Node.js, but in most cases, module code that works in Node.js will work in other runtimes and in bundlers.

Of course, this guidance can only apply in cases where the library ships outputs from `tsc`. If the library is being bundled before shipping, `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` may be acceptable. Any build tool that changes the module format or module specifiers to produce the final build of the library bears the responsibility of ensuring the safety and compatibility of the product’s module code, and `tsc` can no longer contribute to that task, since it can’t know what module code will exist at runtime.

 
 

- In Node.js v20.19.0 and later, a `require` of an ES module is allowed, but only if the resolved module and its top-level imports don’t use top-level `await`. TypeScript does not try to enforce this rule, as it lacks the ability to tell from a declaration file whether the corresponding JavaScript file contains top-level `await`. ↩

# Using Babel with TypeScript

 

## Babel vs `tsc` for TypeScript

When making a modern JavaScript project, you might ask yourself what is the right way to convert files from TypeScript to JavaScript?

A lot of the time the answer is “it depends” , or “someone may have decided for you” depending on the project. If you are building your project with an existing framework like tsdx , Angular , NestJS or any framework mentioned in the Getting Started then this decision is handled for you.

However, a useful heuristic could be:

 Is your build output mostly the same as your source input files? Use `tsc`

- Do you need a build pipeline with multiple potential outputs? Use `babel` for transpiling and `tsc` for type checking

## Babel for transpiling, `tsc` for types

This is a common pattern for projects with existing build infrastructure which may have been ported from a JavaScript codebase to TypeScript.

This technique is a hybrid approach, using Babel’s preset-typescript to generate your JS files, and then using TypeScript to do type checking and `.d.ts` file generation.

By using babel’s support for TypeScript, you get the ability to work with existing build pipelines and are more likely to have a faster JS emit time because Babel does not type check your code.

#### Type Checking and d.ts file generation

The downside to using babel is that you don’t get type checking during the transition from TS to JS. This can mean that type errors which you miss in your editor could sneak through into production code.

In addition to that, Babel cannot create `.d.ts` files for your TypeScript which can make it harder to work with your project if it is a library.

To fix these issues, you would probably want to set up a command to type check your project using TSC. This likely means duplicating some of your babel config into a corresponding `tsconfig.json` and ensuring these flags are enabled:



```
"compilerOptions": {  // Ensure that .d.ts files are created by tsc, but not .js files  "declaration": true,  "emitDeclarationOnly": true,  // Ensure that Babel can safely transpile files in the TypeScript project  "isolatedModules": true}
```



For more information on these flags:

- `isolatedModules` 

- `declaration` , `emitDeclarationOnly`

# Modules - Choosing Compiler Options

 

## I’m writing an app

A single tsconfig.json can only represent a single environment, both in terms of what globals are available and in terms of how modules behave. If your app contains server code, DOM code, web worker code, test code, and code to be shared by all of those, each of those should have its own tsconfig.json, connected with project references . Then, use this guide once for each tsconfig.json. For library-like projects within an app, especially ones that need to run in multiple runtime environments, use the “ I’m writing a library ” section.

### I’m using a bundler

In addition to adopting the following settings, it’s also recommended not to set `{ "type": "module" }` or use `.mts` files in bundler projects for now. Some bundlers adopt different ESM/CJS interop behavior under these circumstances, which TypeScript cannot currently analyze with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`. See issue #54102 for more information.



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    // This is not a complete template; it only    // shows relevant module-related settings.    // Be sure to set other important options    // like `target`, `lib`, and `strict`.    // Required    "module": "esnext",    "moduleResolution": "bundler",    "esModuleInterop": true,    // Consult your bundler’s documentation    "customConditions": ["module"],    // Recommended    "noEmit": true, // or `emitDeclarationOnly`    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,    "allowArbitraryExtensions": true,    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true, // or `isolatedModules`  }}
```



### I’m compiling and running the outputs in Node.js

Remember to set `"type": "module"` or use `.mts` files if you intend to emit ES modules.



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    // This is not a complete template; it only    // shows relevant module-related settings.    // Be sure to set other important options    // like `target`, `lib`, and `strict`.    // Required    "module": "nodenext",    // Implied by `"module": "nodenext"`:    // "moduleResolution": "nodenext",    // "esModuleInterop": true,    // "target": "esnext",    // Recommended    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,  }}
```



### I’m using ts-node

ts-node attempts to be compatible with the same code and the same tsconfig.json settings that can be used to compile and run the JS outputs in Node.js . Refer to ts-node documentation for more details.

### I’m using tsx

Whereas ts-node makes minimal modifications to Node.js’s module system by default, tsx behaves more like a bundler, allowing extensionless/index module specifiers and arbitrary mixing of ESM and CJS. Use the same settings for tsx as you would for a bundler .

### I’m writing ES modules for the browser, with no bundler or module compiler

TypeScript does not currently have options dedicated to this scenario, but you can approximate them by using a combination of the `nodenext` ESM module resolution algorithm and `paths` as a substitute for URL and import map support.



```id
json// tsconfig.json{  "compilerOptions": {    // This is not a complete template; it only    // shows relevant module-related settings.    // Be sure to set other important options    // like `target`, `lib`, and `strict`.    // Combined with `"type": "module"` in a local package.json,    // this enforces including file extensions on relative path imports.    "module": "nodenext",    "paths": {      // Point TS to local types for remote URLs:      "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21": ["./node_modules/@types/lodash/index.d.ts"],      // Optional: point bare specifier imports to an empty file      // to prohibit importing from node_modules specifiers not listed here:      "*": ["./empty-file.ts"]    }  }}
```



This setup allows explicitly listed HTTPS imports to use locally-installed type declaration files, while erroring on imports that would normally resolve in node_modules:



```id
tsimport {} from "lodash";//             ^^^^^^^^// File '/project/empty-file.ts' is not a module. ts(2306)
```



Alternatively, you can use import maps to explicitly map a list of bare specifiers to URLs in the browser, while relying on `nodenext`’s default node_modules lookups, or on `paths`, to direct TypeScript to type declaration files for those bare specifier imports:



```id
html<script type="importmap">{  "imports": {    "lodash": "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21"  }}</script>
```




```id
tsimport {} from "lodash";// Browser: https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21// TypeScript: ./node_modules/@types/lodash/index.d.ts
```



## I’m writing a library

 

Choosing compilation settings as a library author is a fundamentally different process from choosing settings as an app author. When writing an app, settings are chosen that reflect the runtime environment or bundler—typically a single entity with known behavior. When writing a library, you would ideally check your code under all possible library consumer compilation settings. Since this is impractical, you can instead use the strictest possible settings, since satisfying those tends to satisfy all others.



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "node18",    "target": "es2020", // set to the *lowest* target you support    "strict": true,    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,    "declaration": true,    "sourceMap": true,    "declarationMap": true,    "rootDir": "src",    "outDir": "dist"  }}
```



Let’s examine why we picked each of these settings:

 

 `module: "node18"` . When a codebase is compatible with Node.js’s module system, it almost always works in bundlers as well. If you’re using a third-party emitter to emit ESM outputs, ensure that you set `"type": "module"` in your package.json so TypeScript checks your code as ESM, which uses a stricter module resolution algorithm in Node.js than CommonJS does. As an example, let’s look at what would happen if a library were to compile with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`:



```id
tsexport * from "./utils";
```



Assuming `./utils.ts` (or `./utils/index.ts`) exists, a bundler would be fine with this code, so `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` doesn’t complain. Compiled with `"module": "esnext"`, the output JavaScript for this export statement will look exactly the same as the input. If that JavaScript were published to npm, it would be usable by projects that use a bundler, but it would cause an error when run in Node.js:



```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../node_modules/dependency/utils' imported from .../node_modules/dependency/index.jsDid you mean to import ./utils.js?
```



On the other hand, if we had written:



```id
tsexport * from "./utils.js";
```



This would produce output that works both in Node.js and in bundlers.

In short, `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` is infectious, allowing code that only works in bundlers to be produced. Likewise, `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` is only checking that the output works in Node.js, but in most cases, module code that works in Node.js will work in other runtimes and in bundlers.

- 

 `target: "es2020"` . Setting this value to the lowest ECMAScript version that you intend to support ensures the emitted code will not use language features introduced in a later version. Since `target` also implies a corresponding value for `lib`, this also ensures you don’t access globals that may not be available in older environments.

- 

 `strict: true` . Without this, you may write type-level code that ends up in your output `.d.ts` files and errors when a consumer compiles with `strict` enabled. For example, this `extends` clause:



```id
tsexport interface Super {  foo: string;}export interface Sub extends Super {  foo: string | undefined;}
```



is only an error under `strictNullChecks`. On the other hand, it’s very difficult to write code that errors only when `strict` is disabled , so it’s highly recommended for libraries to compile with `strict`.

- 

 `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` . This setting protects against a few module-related pitfalls that can cause problems for library consumers. First, it prevents writing any import statements that could be interpreted ambiguously based on the user’s value of `esModuleInterop` or `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`. Previously, it was often suggested that libraries compile without `esModuleInterop`, since its use in libraries could force users to adopt it too. However, it’s also possible to write imports that only work without `esModuleInterop`, so neither value for the setting guarantees portability for libraries. `verbatimModuleSyntax` does provide such a guarantee. 1 Second, it prevents the use of `export default` in modules that will be emitted as CommonJS, which can require bundler users and Node.js ESM users to consume the module differently. See the appendix on ESM/CJS Interop for more details.

- 

 `declaration: true` emits type declaration files alongside the output JavaScript. This is needed for consumers of the library to have any type information.

- 

 `sourceMap: true` and `declarationMap: true` emit source maps for the output JavaScript and type declaration files, respectively. These are only useful if the library also ships its source (`.ts`) files. By shipping source maps and source files, consumers of the library will be able to debug the library code somewhat more easily. By shipping declaration maps and source files, consumers will be able to see the original TypeScript sources when they run Go To Definition on imports from the libraries. Both of these represent a tradeoff between developer experience and library size, so it’s up to you whether to include them.

- 

 `rootDir: "src"` and `outDir: "dist"` . Using a separate output directory is always a good idea, but it’s necessary for libraries that publish their input files. Otherwise, extension substitution will cause the library’s consumers to load the library’s `.ts` files instead of `.d.ts` files, causing type errors and performance problems.

### Considerations for bundling libraries

If you’re using a bundler to emit your library, then all your (non-externalized) imports will be processed by the bundler with known behavior, not by your users’ unknowable environments. In this case, you can use `"module": "esnext"` and `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`, but only with two caveats:

- 

TypeScript cannot model module resolution when some files are bundled and some are externalized. When bundling libraries with dependencies, it’s common to bundle the first-party library source code into a single file, but leave imports of external dependencies as real imports in the bundled output. This essentially means module resolution is split between the bundler and the end user’s environment. To model this in TypeScript, you would want to process bundled imports with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` and externalized imports with `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` (or with multiple options to check that everything will work in a range of end-user environments). But TypeScript cannot be configured to use two different module resolution settings in the same compilation. As a consequence, using `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` may allow imports of externalized dependencies that would work in a bundler but are unsafe in Node.js. On the other hand, using `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` may impose overly strict requirements on bundled imports.

- 

You must ensure that your declaration files get bundled as well. Recall the first rule of declaration files : every declaration file represents exactly one JavaScript file. If you use `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` and use a bundler to emit an ESM bundle while using `tsc` to emit many individual declaration files, your declaration files may cause errors when consumed under `"module": "nodenext"`. For example, an input file like:



```id
tsimport { Component } from "./extensionless-relative-import";
```



will have its import erased by the JS bundler, but produce a declaration file with an identical import statement. That import statement, however, will contain an invalid module specifier in Node.js, since it’s missing a file extension. For Node.js users, TypeScript will error on the declaration file and infect types referencing `Component` with `any`, assuming the dependency will crash at runtime.

If your TypeScript bundler does not produce bundled declaration files, use `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` to ensure that the imports preserved in your declaration files will be compatible with end-users’ TypeScript settings. Even better, consider not bundling your library.

### Notes on dual-emit solutions

A single TypeScript compilation (whether emitting or just type checking) assumes that each input file will only produce one output file. Even if `tsc` isn’t emitting anything, the type checking it performs on imported names rely on knowledge about how the output file will behave at runtime, based on the module- and emit-related options set in the tsconfig.json. While third-party emitters are generally safe to use in combination with `tsc` type checking as long as `tsc` can be configured to understand what the other emitter will emit, any solution that emits two different sets of outputs with different module formats while only type checking once leaves (at least) one of the outputs unchecked. Because external dependencies may expose different APIs to CommonJS and ESM consumers, there’s no configuration you can use to guarantee in a single compilation that both outputs will be type-safe. In practice, most dependencies follow best practices and dual-emit outputs work. Running tests and static analysis against all output bundles before publishing significantly reduces the chance of a serious problem going unnoticed.

 
 

- `verbatimModuleSyntax` can only work when the JS emitter emits the same module kind as `tsc` would given the tsconfig.json, source file extension, and package.json `"type"`. The option works by enforcing that the `import`/`require` written is identical to the `import`/`require` emitted. Any configuration that produces both an ESM and a CJS output from the same source file is fundamentally incompatible with `verbatimModuleSyntax`, since its whole purpose is to prevent you from writing `import` anywhere that a `require` would be emitted. `verbatimModuleSyntax` can also be defeated by configuring a third-party emitter to emit a different module kind than `tsc` would—for example, by setting `"module": "esnext"` in tsconfig.json while configuring Babel to emit CommonJS. ↩

# TypeScript 5.9

 

## Minimal and Updated `tsc --init`

For a while, the TypeScript compiler has supported an `--init` flag that can create a `tsconfig.json` within the current directory.
In the last few years, running `tsc --init` created a very “full” `tsconfig.json`, filled with commented-out settings and their descriptions.
We designed this with the intent of making options discoverable and easy to toggle.

However, given external feedback (and our own experience), we found it’s common to immediately delete most of the contents of these new `tsconfig.json` files.
When users want to discover new options, we find they rely on auto-complete from their editor, or navigate to the tsconfig reference on our website (which the generated `tsconfig.json` links to!).
What each setting does is also documented on that same page, and can be seen via editor hovers/tooltips/quick info.
While surfacing some commented-out settings might be helpful, the generated `tsconfig.json` was often considered overkill.

We also felt that it was time that `tsc --init` initialized with a few more prescriptive settings than we already enable.
We looked at some common pain points and papercuts users have when they create a new TypeScript project.
For example, most users write in modules (not global scripts), and `--moduleDetection` can force TypeScript to treat every implementation file as a module.
Developers also often want to use the latest ECMAScript features directly in their runtime, so `--target` can typically be set to `esnext`.
JSX users often find that going back to set `--jsx` is needless friction, and its options are slightly confusing.
And often, projects end up loading more declaration files from `node_modules/@types` than TypeScript actually needs; but specifying an empty `types` array can help limit this.

In TypeScript 5.9, a plain `tsc --init` with no other flags will generate the following `tsconfig.json`:



```id
json{  // Visit https://aka.ms/tsconfig to read more about this file  "compilerOptions": {    // File Layout    // "rootDir": "./src",    // "outDir": "./dist",    // Environment Settings    // See also https://aka.ms/tsconfig_modules    "module": "nodenext",    "target": "esnext",    "types": [],    // For nodejs:    // "lib": ["esnext"],    // "types": ["node"],    // and npm install -D @types/node    // Other Outputs    "sourceMap": true,    "declaration": true,    "declarationMap": true,    // Stricter Typechecking Options    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,    // Style Options    // "noImplicitReturns": true,    // "noImplicitOverride": true,    // "noUnusedLocals": true,    // "noUnusedParameters": true,    // "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,    // "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,    // Recommended Options    "strict": true,    "jsx": "react-jsx",    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,    "isolatedModules": true,    "noUncheckedSideEffectImports": true,    "moduleDetection": "force",    "skipLibCheck": true,  }}
```



For more details, see the implementing pull request and discussion issue .

## Support for `import defer`

TypeScript 5.9 introduces support for ECMAScript’s deferred module evaluation proposal using the new `import defer` syntax.
This feature allows you to import a module without immediately executing the module and its dependencies, providing better control over when work and side-effects occur.

The syntax only permits namespace imports:



```id
tsimport defer * as feature from "./some-feature.js";
```



The key benefit of `import defer` is that the module is only evaluated when one of its exports is first accessed.
Consider this example:



```id
ts// ./some-feature.tsinitializationWithSideEffects();function initializationWithSideEffects() {  // ...  specialConstant = 42;  console.log("Side effects have occurred!");}export let specialConstant: number;
```



When using `import defer`, the `initializationWithSideEffects()` function will not be called until you actually access a property of the imported namespace:



```id
tsimport defer * as feature from "./some-feature.js";// No side effects have occurred yet// ...// As soon as `specialConstant` is accessed, the contents of the `feature`// module are run and side effects have taken place.console.log(feature.specialConstant); // 42
```



Because evaluation of the module is deferred until you access a member off of the module, you cannot use named imports or default imports with `import defer`:



```id
ts// ❌ Not allowedimport defer { doSomething } from "some-module";// ❌ Not allowed  import defer defaultExport from "some-module";// ✅ Only this syntax is supportedimport defer * as feature from "some-module";
```



Note that when you write `import defer`, the module and its dependencies are fully loaded and ready for execution.
That means that the module will need to exist, and will be loaded from the file system or a network resource.
The key difference between a regular `import` and `import defer` is that the execution of statements and declarations is deferred until you access a property of the imported namespace.

This feature is particularly useful for conditionally loading modules with expensive or platform-specific initialization. It can also improve startup performance by deferring module evaluation for app features until they are actually needed.

Note that `import defer` is not transformed or “downleveled” at all by TypeScript.
It is intended to be used in runtimes that support the feature natively, or by tools such as bundlers that can apply the appropriate transformation.
That means that `import defer` will only work under the `--module` modes `preserve` and `esnext`.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Nicolò Ribaudo who championed the proposal in TC39 and also provided the implementation for this feature .

## Support for `--module node20`

TypeScript provides several `node*` options for the `--module` and `--moduleResolution` settings.
Most recently, `--module nodenext` has supported the ability to `require()` ECMAScript modules from CommonJS modules, and correctly rejects import assertions (in favor of the standards-bound import attributes ).

TypeScript 5.9 brings a stable option for these settings called `node20`, intended to model the behavior of Node.js v20.
This option is unlikely to have new behaviors in the future, unlike `--module nodenext` or `--moduleResolution nodenext`.
Also unlike `nodenext`, specifying `--module node20` will imply `--target es2023` unless otherwise configured.
`--module nodenext`, on the other hand, implies the floating `--target esnext`.

For more information, take a look at the implementation here .

## Summary Descriptions in DOM APIs

Previously, many of the DOM APIs in TypeScript only linked to the MDN documentation for the API.
These links were useful, but they didn’t provide a quick summary of what the API does.
Thanks to a few changes from Adam Naji , TypeScript now includes summary descriptions for many DOM APIs based on the MDN documentation.
You can see more of these changes here and here .

## Expandable Hovers (Preview)

 Quick Info (also called “editor tooltips” and “hovers”) can be very useful for peeking at variables to see their types, or at type aliases to see what they actually refer to.
Still, it’s common for people to want to go deeper and get details from whatever’s displayed within the quick info tooltip.
For example, if we hover our mouse over the parameter `options` in the following example:



```id
tsexport function drawButton(options: Options): void
```



We’re left with `(parameter) options: Options`.

 

Do we really need to jump to the definition of the type `Options` just to see what members this value has?

Previously, that was actually the case.
To help here, TypeScript 5.9 is now previewing a feature called expandable hovers , or “quick info verbosity”.
If you use an editor like VS Code, you’ll now see a `+` and `-` button on the left of these hover tooltips.
Clicking on the `+` button will expand out types more deeply, while clicking on the `-` button will collapse to the last view.

 

This feature is currently in preview, and we are seeking feedback for both TypeScript and our partners on Visual Studio Code.
For more details, see the PR for this feature here .

## Configurable Maximum Hover Length

Occasionally, quick info tooltips can become so long that TypeScript will truncate them to make them more readable.
The downside here is that often the most important information will be omitted from the hover tooltip, which can be frustrating.
To help with this, TypeScript 5.9’s language server supports a configurable hover length, which can be configured in VS Code via the `js/ts.hover.maximumLength` setting.

Additionally, the new default hover length is substantially larger than the previous default.
This means that in TypeScript 5.9, you should see more information in your hover tooltips by default.
For more details, see the PR for this feature here and the corresponding change to Visual Studio Code here .

## Optimizations

### Cache Instantiations on Mappers

When TypeScript replaces type parameters with specific type arguments, it can end up instantiating many of the same intermediate types over and over again.
In complex libraries like Zod and tRPC, this could lead to both performance issues and errors reported around excessive type instantiation depth.
Thanks to a change from Mateusz Burzyński , TypeScript 5.9 is able to cache many intermediate instantiations when work has already begun on a specific type instantiation.
This in turn avoids lots of unnecessary work and allocations.

### Avoiding Closure Creation in `fileOrDirectoryExistsUsingSource`

In JavaScript, a function expression will typically allocate a new function object, even if the wrapper function is just passing through arguments to another function with no captured variables.
In code paths around file existence checks, Vincent Bailly found examples of these pass-through function calls, even though the underlying functions only took single arguments.
Given the number of existence checks that could take place in larger projects, he cited a speed-up of around 11%.
 See more on this change here .

## Notable Behavioral Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.

Additionally, one notable change is that `ArrayBuffer` has been changed in such a way that it is no longer a supertype of several different `TypedArray` types.
This also includes subtypes of `UInt8Array`, such as `Buffer` from Node.js.
As a result, you’ll see new error messages such as:



```
error TS2345: Argument of type 'ArrayBufferLike' is not assignable to parameter of type 'BufferSource'.error TS2322: Type 'ArrayBufferLike' is not assignable to type 'ArrayBuffer'.error TS2322: Type 'Buffer' is not assignable to type 'Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'.error TS2322: Type 'Buffer' is not assignable to type 'ArrayBuffer'.error TS2345: Argument of type 'Buffer' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'.
```



If you encounter issues with `Buffer`, you may first want to check that you are using the latest version of the `@types/node` package.
This might include running



```
npm update @types/node --save-dev
```



Much of the time, the solution is to specify a more specific underlying buffer type instead of using the default `ArrayBufferLike` (i.e. explicitly writing out `Uint8Array ` rather than a plain `Uint8Array`).
In instances where some `TypedArray` (like `Uint8Array`) is passed to a function expecting an `ArrayBuffer` or `SharedArrayBuffer`, you can also try accessing the `buffer` property of that `TypedArray` like in the following example:



```id
diff  let data = new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);- someFunc(data)+ someFunc(data.buffer)
```



## Type Argument Inference Changes

In an effort to fix “leaks” of type variables during inference, TypeScript 5.9 may introduce changes in types and possibly new errors in some codebases.
These are hard to predict, but can often be fixed by adding type arguments to generic functions calls.
 See more details here .

# Modules - Reference

 

## Module syntax

The TypeScript compiler recognizes standard ECMAScript module syntax in TypeScript and JavaScript files and many forms of CommonJS syntax in JavaScript files.

There are also a few TypeScript-specific syntax extensions that can be used in TypeScript files and/or JSDoc comments.

### Importing and exporting TypeScript-specific declarations

Type aliases, interfaces, enums, and namespaces can be exported from a module with an `export` modifier, like any standard JavaScript declaration:



```id
ts// Standard JavaScript syntax...export function f() {}// ...extended to type declarationsexport type SomeType = /* ... */;export interface SomeInterface { /* ... */ }
```



They can also be referenced in named exports, even alongside references to standard JavaScript declarations:



```id
tsexport { f, SomeType, SomeInterface };
```



Exported types (and other TypeScript-specific declarations) can be imported with standard ECMAScript imports:



```id
tsimport { f, SomeType, SomeInterface } from "./module.js";
```



When using namespace imports or exports, exported types are available on the namespace when referenced in a type position:



```id
tsimport * as mod from "./module.js";mod.f();mod.SomeType; // Property 'SomeType' does not exist on type 'typeof import("./module.js")'let x: mod.SomeType; // Ok
```



### Type-only imports and exports

When emitting imports and exports to JavaScript, by default, TypeScript automatically elides (does not emit) imports that are only used in type positions and exports that only refer to types. Type-only imports and exports can be used to force this behavior and make the elision explicit. Import declarations written with `import type`, export declarations written with `export type { ... }`, and import or export specifiers prefixed with the `type` keyword are all guaranteed to be elided from the output JavaScript.



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport { f, type SomeInterface } from "./module.js";import type { SomeType } from "./module.js";class C implements SomeInterface {  constructor(p: SomeType) {    f();  }}export type { C };// @Filename: main.jsimport { f } from "./module.js";class C {  constructor(p) {    f();  }}
```



Even values can be imported with `import type`, but since they won’t exist in the output JavaScript, they can only be used in non-emitting positions:



```id
tsimport type { f } from "./module.js";f(); // 'f' cannot be used as a value because it was imported using 'import type'let otherFunction: typeof f = () => {}; // Ok
```



A type-only import declaration may not declare both a default import and named bindings, since it appears ambiguous whether `type` applies to the default import or to the entire import declaration. Instead, split the import declaration into two, or use `default` as a named binding:



```id
tsimport type fs, { BigIntOptions } from "fs";//          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^// Error: A type-only import can specify a default import or named bindings, but not both.import type { default as fs, BigIntOptions } from "fs"; // Ok
```



### `import()` types

TypeScript provides a type syntax similar to JavaScript’s dynamic `import` for referencing the type of a module without writing an import declaration:



```id
ts// Access an exported type:type WriteFileOptions = import("fs").WriteFileOptions;// Access the type of an exported value:type WriteFileFunction = typeof import("fs").writeFile;
```



This is especially useful in JSDoc comments in JavaScript files, where it’s not possible to import types otherwise:



```id
ts/** @type {import("webpack").Configuration} */module.exports = {  // ...}
```



### `export =` and `import = require()`

When emitting CommonJS modules, TypeScript files can use a direct analog of `module.exports = ...` and `const mod = require("...")` JavaScript syntax:



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport fs = require("fs");export = fs.readFileSync("...");// @Filename: main.js"use strict";const fs = require("fs");module.exports = fs.readFileSync("...");
```



This syntax was used over its JavaScript counterparts since variable declarations and property assignments could not refer to TypeScript types, whereas special TypeScript syntax could:



```id
ts// @Filename: a.tsinterface Options { /* ... */ }module.exports = Options; // Error: 'Options' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.export = Options; // Ok// @Filename: b.tsconst Options = require("./a");const options: Options = { /* ... */ }; // Error: 'Options' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here.// @Filename: c.tsimport Options = require("./a");const options: Options = { /* ... */ }; // Ok
```



### Ambient modules

TypeScript supports a syntax in script (non-module) files for declaring a module that exists in the runtime but has no corresponding file. These ambient modules usually represent runtime-provided modules, like `"fs"` or `"path"` in Node.js:



```id
tsdeclare module "path" {  export function normalize(p: string): string;  export function join(...paths: any[]): string;  export var sep: string;}
```



Once an ambient module is loaded into a TypeScript program, TypeScript will recognize imports of the declared module in other files:



```id
ts// 👇 Ensure the ambient module is loaded -//    may be unnecessary if path.d.ts is included//    by the project tsconfig.json somehow./// <reference path="path.d.ts" />import { normalize, join } from "path";
```



Ambient module declarations are easy to confuse with module augmentations since they use identical syntax. This module declaration syntax becomes a module augmentation when the file is a module, meaning it has a top-level `import` or `export` statement (or is affected by `--moduleDetection force` or `auto` ):



```id
ts// Not an ambient module declaration anymore!export {};declare module "path" {  export function normalize(p: string): string;  export function join(...paths: any[]): string;  export var sep: string;}
```



Ambient modules may use imports inside the module declaration body to refer to other modules without turning the containing file into a module (which would make the ambient module declaration a module augmentation):



```id
tsdeclare module "m" {  // Moving this outside "m" would totally change the meaning of the file!  import { SomeType } from "other";  export function f(): SomeType;}
```



A pattern ambient module contains a single `*` wildcard character in its name, matching zero or more characters in import paths. This can be useful for declaring modules provided by custom loaders:



```id
tsdeclare module "*.html" {  const content: string;  export default content;}
```



## The `module` compiler option

This section discusses the details of each `module` compiler option value. See the Module output format theory section for more background on what the option is and how it fits into the overall compilation process. In brief, the `module` compiler option was historically only used to control the output module format of emitted JavaScript files. The more recent `node16`, `node18`, and `nodenext` values, however, describe a wide range of characteristics of Node.js’s module system, including what module formats are supported, how the module format of each file is determined, and how different module formats interoperate.

### `node16`, `node18`, `node20`, `nodenext`

Node.js supports both CommonJS and ECMAScript modules, with specific rules for which format each file can be and how the two formats are allowed to interoperate. `node16`, `node18`, and `nodenext` describe the full range of behavior for Node.js’s dual-format module system, and emit files in either CommonJS or ESM format . This is different from every other `module` option, which are runtime-agnostic and force all output files into a single format, leaving it to the user to ensure the output is valid for their runtime.

 

A common misconception is that `node16`—`nodenext` only emit ES modules. In reality, these modes describe versions of Node.js that support ES modules, not just projects that use ES modules. Both ESM and CommonJS emit are supported, based on the detected module format of each file. Because they are the only `module` options that reflect the complexities of Node.js’s dual module system, they are the only correct `module` options for all apps and libraries that are intended to run in Node.js v12 or later, whether they use ES modules or not.

 

The fixed-version `node16` and `node18` modes represent the module system behavior stabilized in their respective Node.js versions, while the `nodenext` mode changes with the latest stable versions of Node.js. The following table summarizes the current differences between the three modes:

 
 
 
 
 `target` 
 `moduleResolution`

#### Module format detection

 `.mts`/`.mjs`/`.d.mts` files are always ES modules.

- `.cts`/`.cjs`/`.d.cts` files are always CommonJS modules.

- `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.jsx`/`.d.ts` files are ES modules if the nearest ancestor package.json file contains `"type": "module"`, otherwise CommonJS modules.

The detected module format of input `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` files determines the module format of the emitted JavaScript files. So, for example, a project consisting entirely of `.ts` files will emit all CommonJS modules by default under `--module nodenext`, and can be made to emit all ES modules by adding `"type": "module"` to the project package.json.

#### Interoperability rules

- When an ES module references a CommonJS module: 

 The `module.exports` of the CommonJS module is available as a default import to the ES module.

- Properties (other than `default`) of the CommonJS module’s `module.exports` may or may not be available as named imports to the ES module. Node.js attempts to make them available via static analysis . TypeScript cannot know from a declaration file whether that static analysis will succeed, and optimistically assumes it will. This limits TypeScript’s ability to catch named imports that may crash at runtime. See #54018 for more details.

 
- When a CommonJS module references an ES module: 

 In `node16` and `node18`, `require` cannot reference an ES module. For TypeScript, this includes `import` statements in files that are detected to be CommonJS modules, since those `import` statements will be transformed to `require` calls in the emitted JavaScript.

- In `nodenext`, to reflect the behavior of Node.js v22.12.0 and later, `require` can reference an ES module. In Node.js, an error is thrown if the ES module, or any of its imported modules, uses top-level `await`. TypeScript does not attempt to detect this case and will not emit a compile-time error. The result of the `require` call is the module’s Module Namespace Object, i.e., the same as the result of an `await import()` of the same module (but without the need to `await` anything).

- A dynamic `import()` call can always be used to import an ES module. It returns a Promise of the module’s Module Namespace Object (what you’d get from `import * as ns from "./module.js"` from another ES module).

 

#### Emit

The emit format of each file is determined by the detected module format of each file. ESM emit is similar to `--module esnext` , but has a special transformation for `import x = require("...")`, which is not allowed in `--module esnext`:



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport x = require("mod");
```




```id
js// @Filename: main.jsimport { createRequire as _createRequire } from "module";const __require = _createRequire(import.meta.url);const x = __require("mod");
```



CommonJS emit is similar to `--module commonjs` , but dynamic `import()` calls are not transformed. Emit here is shown with `esModuleInterop` enabled:



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport fs from "fs"; // transformedconst dynamic = import("mod"); // not transformed
```




```id
js// @Filename: main.js"use strict";var __importDefault = (this && this.__importDefault) || function (mod) {    return (mod && mod.__esModule) ? mod : { "default": mod };};Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });const fs_1 = __importDefault(require("fs")); // transformedconst dynamic = import("mod"); // not transformed
```



#### Implied and enforced options

- `--module nodenext` implies and enforces `--moduleResolution nodenext`.

- `--module node18` or `node16` implies and enforces `--moduleResolution node16`.

- `--module nodenext` implies `--target esnext`.

- `--module node18` or `node16` implies `--target es2022`.

- `--module nodenext` or `node18` or `node16` implies `--esModuleInterop`.

#### Summary

- `node16`, `node18`, and `nodenext` are the only correct `module` options for all apps and libraries that are intended to run in Node.js v12 or later, whether they use ES modules or not.

- `node16`, `node18`, and `nodenext` emit files in either CommonJS or ESM format, based on the detected module format of each file.

- Node.js’s interoperability rules between ESM and CJS are reflected in type checking.

- ESM emit transforms `import x = require("...")` to a `require` call constructed from a `createRequire` import.

- CommonJS emit leaves dynamic `import()` calls untransformed, so CommonJS modules can asynchronously import ES modules.

### `preserve`

In `--module preserve` ( added in TypeScript 5.4), ECMAScript imports and exports written in input files are preserved in the output, and CommonJS-style `import x = require("...")` and `export = ...` statements are emitted as CommonJS `require` and `module.exports`. In other words, the format of each individual import or export statement is preserved, rather than being coerced into a single format for the whole compilation (or even a whole file).

While it’s rare to need to mix imports and require calls in the same file, this `module` mode best reflects the capabilities of most modern bundlers, as well as the Bun runtime.

 

Why care about TypeScript’s `module` emit with a bundler or with Bun, where you’re likely also setting `noEmit`? TypeScript’s type checking and module resolution behavior are affected by the module format that it would emit. Setting `module` gives TypeScript information about how your bundler or runtime will process imports and exports, which ensures that the types you see on imported values accurately reflect what will happen at runtime or after bundling. See `--moduleResolution bundler` for more discussion.

 

#### Examples



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";import mod = require("mod");const dynamic = import("mod");export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";
```




```id
js// @Filename: main.jsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";const mod = require("mod");const dynamic = import("mod");export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";
```



#### Implied and enforced options

- `--module preserve` implies `--moduleResolution bundler`.

- `--module preserve` implies `--esModuleInterop`.

 

The option `--esModuleInterop` is enabled by default in `--module preserve` only for its type checking behavior. Since imports never transform into require calls in `--module preserve`, `--esModuleInterop` does not affect the emitted JavaScript.

 

### `es2015`, `es2020`, `es2022`, `esnext`

#### Summary

- Use `esnext` with `--moduleResolution bundler` for bundlers, Bun, and tsx.

- Do not use for Node.js. Use `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext` with `"type": "module"` in package.json to emit ES modules for Node.js.

- `import mod = require("mod")` is not allowed in non-declaration files.

- `es2020` adds support for `import.meta` properties.

- `es2022` adds support for top-level `await`.

- `esnext` is a moving target that may include support for Stage 3 proposals to ECMAScript modules.

- Emitted files are ES modules, but dependencies may be any format.

#### Examples



```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";import * as mod from "mod";const dynamic = import("mod");console.log(x, y, z, mod, dynamic);export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";
```




```id
js// @Filename: main.jsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";import * as mod from "mod";const dynamic = import("mod");console.log(x, y, z, mod, dynamic);export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";
```



### `commonjs`

#### Summary

- You probably shouldn’t use this. Use `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext` to emit CommonJS modules for Node.js.

- Emitted files are CommonJS modules, but dependencies may be any format.

- `esModuleInterop` affects the output code for default and namespace imports.

#### Examples

 

Output is shown with `esModuleInterop: false`.

 


```id
ts// @Filename: main.tsimport x, { y, z } from "mod";import * as mod from "mod";const dynamic = import("mod");console.log(x, y, z, mod, dynamic);export const e1 = 0;export default "default export";

## The `moduleResolution` compiler option

This section describes module resolution features and processes shared by multiple `moduleResolution` modes, then specifies the details of each mode. See the Module resolution theory section for more background on what the option is and how it fits into the overall compilation process. In brief, `moduleResolution` controls how TypeScript resolves module specifiers (string literals in `import`/`export`/`require` statements) to files on disk, and should be set to match the module resolver used by the target runtime or bundler.

### Common features and processes

#### File extension substitution

TypeScript always wants to resolve internally to a file that can provide type information, while ensuring that the runtime or bundler can use the same path to resolve to a file that provides a JavaScript implementation. For any module specifier that would, according to the `moduleResolution` algorithm specified, trigger a lookup of a JavaScript file in the runtime or bundler, TypeScript will first try to find a TypeScript implementation file or type declaration file with the same name and analagous file extension.

 
 
 
 Runtime lookup 
 TypeScript lookup #1 
 TypeScript lookup #2 
 TypeScript lookup #3 
 TypeScript lookup #4 
 TypeScript lookup #5 
 
 
 
 
 `/mod.js` 
 `/mod.ts` 
 `/mod.tsx` 
 `/mod.d.ts` 
 `/mod.js` 
 `./mod.jsx` 
 
 
 `/mod.mjs` 
 `/mod.mts` 
 `/mod.d.mts` 
 `/mod.mjs` 
 
 
 
 
 `/mod.cjs` 
 `/mod.cts` 
 `/mod.d.cts` 
 `/mod.cjs` 
 
 
 
 
 

Note that this behavior is independent of the actual module specifier written in the import. This means that TypeScript can resolve to a `.ts` or `.d.ts` file even if the module specifier explicitly uses a `.js` file extension:



```id
tsimport x from "./mod.js";// Runtime lookup: "./mod.js"// TypeScript lookup #1: "./mod.ts"// TypeScript lookup #2: "./mod.d.ts"// TypeScript lookup #3: "./mod.js"
```



See TypeScript imitates the host’s module resolution, but with types for an explanation of why TypeScript’s module resolution works this way.

#### Relative file path resolution

All of TypeScript’s `moduleResolution` algorithms support referencing a module by a relative path that includes a file extension (which will be substituted according to the rules above ):



```id
ts// @Filename: a.tsexport {};// @Filename: b.tsimport {} from "./a.js"; // ✅ Works in every `moduleResolution`
```



#### Extensionless relative paths

In some cases, the runtime or bundler allows omitting a `.js` file extension from a relative path. TypeScript supports this behavior where the `moduleResolution` setting and the context indicate that the runtime or bundler supports it:



```id
ts// @Filename: a.tsexport {};// @Filename: b.tsimport {} from "./a";
```



If TypeScript determines that the runtime will perform a lookup for `./a.js` given the module specifier `"./a"`, then `./a.js` will undergo extension substitution , and resolve to the file `a.ts` in this example.

Extensionless relative paths are not supported in `import` paths in Node.js, and are not always supported in file paths specified in package.json files. TypeScript currently never supports omitting a `.mjs`/`.mts` or `.cjs`/`.cts` file extension, even though some runtimes and bundlers do.

#### Directory modules (index file resolution)

In some cases, a directory, rather than a file, can be referenced as a module. In the simplest and most common case, this involves the runtime or bundler looking for an `index.js` file in a directory. TypeScript supports this behavior where the `moduleResolution` setting and the context indicate that the runtime or bundler supports it:



```id
ts// @Filename: dir/index.tsexport {};// @Filename: b.tsimport {} from "./dir";
```



If TypeScript determines that the runtime will perform a lookup for `./dir/index.js` given the module specifier `"./dir"`, then `./dir/index.js` will undergo extension substitution , and resolve to the file `dir/index.ts` in this example.

Directory modules may also contain a package.json file, where resolution of the `"main"` and `"types"` fields are supported, and take precedence over `index.js` lookups. The `"typesVersions"` field is also supported in directory modules.

Note that directory modules are not the same as `node_modules` packages and only support a subset of the features available to packages, and are not supported at all in some contexts. Node.js considers them a legacy feature .

#### `paths`

 Overview 

TypeScript offers a way to override the compiler’s module resolution for bare specifiers with the `paths` compiler option. While the feature was originally designed to be used with the AMD module loader (a means of running modules in the browser before ESM existed or bundlers were widely used), it still has uses today when a runtime or bundler supports module resolution features that TypeScript does not model. For example, when running Node.js with `--experimental-network-imports`, you can manually specify a local type definition file for a specific `https://` import:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "nodenext",    "paths": {      "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21": ["./node_modules/@types/lodash/index.d.ts"]    }  }}
```




```id
ts// Typed by ./node_modules/@types/lodash/index.d.ts due to `paths` entryimport { add } from "https://esm.sh/lodash@4.17.21";
```



It’s also common for apps built with bundlers to define convenience path aliases in their bundler configuration, and then inform TypeScript of those aliases with `paths`:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "esnext",    "moduleResolution": "bundler",    "paths": {      "@app/*": ["./src/*"]    }  }}
```


 `paths` does not affect emit 

The `paths` option does not change the import path in the code emitted by TypeScript. Consequently, it’s very easy to create path aliases that appear to work in TypeScript but will crash at runtime:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "nodenext",    "paths": {      "node-has-no-idea-what-this-is": ["./oops.ts"]    }  }}
```




```id
ts// TypeScript: ✅// Node.js: 💥import {} from "node-has-no-idea-what-this-is";
```



While it’s ok for bundled apps to set up `paths`, it’s very important that published libraries do not , since the emitted JavaScript will not work for consumers of the library without those users setting up the same aliases for both TypeScript and their bundler. Both libraries and apps can consider package.json `"imports"` as a standard replacement for convenience `paths` aliases.

 `paths` should not point to monorepo packages or node_modules packages 

While module specifiers that match `paths` aliases are bare specifiers, once the alias is resolved, module resolution proceeds on the resolved path as a relative path. Consequently, resolution features that happen for `node_modules` package lookups , including package.json `"exports"` field support, do not take effect when a `paths` alias is matched. This can lead to surprising behavior if `paths` is used to point to a `node_modules` package:



```id
ts{  "compilerOptions": {    "paths": {      "pkg": ["./node_modules/pkg/dist/index.d.ts"],      "pkg/*": ["./node_modules/pkg/*"]    }  }}
```



While this configuration may simulate some of the behavior of package resolution, it overrides any `main`, `types`, `exports`, and `typesVersions` the package’s `package.json` file defines, and imports from the package may fail at runtime.

The same caveat applies to packages referencing each other in a monorepo. Instead of using `paths` to make TypeScript artificially resolve `"@my-scope/lib"` to a sibling package, it’s best to use workspaces via npm , yarn , or pnpm to symlink your packages into `node_modules`, so both TypeScript and the runtime or bundler perform real `node_modules` package lookups. This is especially important if the monorepo packages will be published to npm—the packages will reference each other via `node_modules` package lookups once installed by users, and using workspaces allows you to test that behavior during local development.

 Relationship to `baseUrl` 

When `baseUrl` is provided, the values in each `paths` array are resolved relative to the `baseUrl`. Otherwise, they are resolved relative to the `tsconfig.json` file that defines them.

 Wildcard substitutions 

`paths` patterns can contain a single `*` wildcard, which matches any string. The `*` token can then be used in the file path values to substitute the matched string:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "paths": {      "@app/*": ["./src/*"]    }  }}
```



When resolving an import of `"@app/components/Button"`, TypeScript will match on `@app/*`, binding `*` to `components/Button`, and then attempt to resolve the path `./src/components/Button` relative to the `tsconfig.json` path. The remainder of this lookup will follow the same rules as any other relative path lookup according to the `moduleResolution` setting.

When multiple patterns match a module specifier, the pattern with the longest matching prefix before any `*` token is used:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "paths": {      "*": ["./src/foo/one.ts"],      "foo/*": ["./src/foo/two.ts"],      "foo/bar": ["./src/foo/three.ts"]    }  }}
```



When resolving an import of `"foo/bar"`, all three `paths` patterns match, but the last is used because `"foo/bar"` is longer than `"foo/"` and `""`.

 Fallbacks 

Multiple file paths can be provided for a path mapping. If resolution fails for one path, the next one in the array will be attempted until resolution succeeds or the end of the array is reached.



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "paths": {      "*": ["./vendor/*", "./types/*"]    }  }}
```



#### `baseUrl`

 

`baseUrl` was designed for use with AMD module loaders. If you aren’t using an AMD module loader, you probably shouldn’t use `baseUrl`. Since TypeScript 4.1, `baseUrl` is no longer required to use `paths` and should not be used just to set the directory `paths` values are resolved from.

 

The `baseUrl` compiler option can be combined with any `moduleResolution` mode and specifies a directory that bare specifiers (module specifiers that don’t begin with `./`, `../`, or `/`) are resolved from. `baseUrl` has a higher precedence than `node_modules` package lookups in `moduleResolution` modes that support them.

When performing a `baseUrl` lookup, resolution proceeds with the same rules as other relative path resolutions. For example, in a `moduleResolution` mode that supports extensionless relative paths a module specifier `"some-file"` may resolve to `/src/some-file.ts` if `baseUrl` is set to `/src`.

Resolution of relative module specifiers are never affected by the `baseUrl` option.

#### `node_modules` package lookups

Node.js treats module specifiers that aren’t relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs as references to packages that it looks up in `node_modules` subdirectories. Bundlers conveniently adopted this behavior to allow their users to use the same dependency management system, and often even the same dependencies, as they would in Node.js. All of TypeScript’s `moduleResolution` options except `classic` support `node_modules` lookups. (`classic` supports lookups in `node_modules/@types` when other means of resolution fail, but never looks for packages in `node_modules` directly.) Every `node_modules` package lookup has the following structure (beginning after higher precedence bare specifier rules, like `paths`, `baseUrl`, self-name imports, and package.json `"imports"` lookups have been exhausted):

- For each ancestor directory of the importing file, if a `node_modules` directory exists within it:

 If a directory with the same name as the package exists within `node_modules`:

 Attempt to resolve types from the package directory.

- If a result is found, return it and stop the search.

 
- If a directory with the same name as the package exists within `node_modules/@types`:

 Attempt to resolve types from the `@types` package directory.

- If a result is found, return it and stop the search.

 

 
- Repeat the previous search through all `node_modules` directories, but this time, allow JavaScript files as a result, and do not search in `@types` directories.

All `moduleResolution` modes (except `classic`) follow this pattern, while the details of how they resolve from a package directory, once located, differ, and are explained in the following sections.

#### package.json `"exports"`

When `moduleResolution` is set to `node16`, `nodenext`, or `bundler`, and `resolvePackageJsonExports` is not disabled, TypeScript follows Node.js’s package.json `"exports"` spec when resolving from a package directory triggered by a bare specifier `node_modules` package lookup .

TypeScript’s implementation for resolving a module specifier through `"exports"` to a file path follows Node.js exactly. Once a file path is resolved, however, TypeScript will still try multiple file extensions in order to prioritize finding types.

When resolving through conditional `"exports"` , TypeScript always matches the `"types"` and `"default"` conditions if present. Additionally, TypeScript will match a versioned types condition in the form `"types@{selector}"` (where `{selector}` is a `"typesVersions"`-compatible version selector) according to the same version-matching rules implemented in `"typesVersions"` . Other non-configurable conditions are dependent on the `moduleResolution` mode and specified in the following sections. Additional conditions can be configured to match with the `customConditions` compiler option.

Note that the presence of `"exports"` prevents any subpaths not explicitly listed or matched by a pattern in `"exports"` from being resolved.

 Example: subpaths, conditions, and extension substitution 

Scenario: `"pkg/subpath"` is requested with conditions `["types", "node", "require"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "exports": {    ".": {      "import": "./index.mjs",      "require": "./index.cjs"    },    "./subpath": {      "import": "./subpath/index.mjs",      "require": "./subpath/index.cjs"    }  }}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- Does `"exports"` have a `"./subpath"` entry? Yes. 

- The value at `exports["./subpath"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"import"` match this request? No. 

- Does the second condition `"require"` match this request? Yes. 

- Does the path `"./subpath/index.cjs"` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? No, so use extension substitution. 

- Via extension substitution , try the following paths, returning the first one that exists, or `undefined` otherwise:

 `./subpath/index.cts`

- `./subpath/index.d.cts`

- `./subpath/index.cjs`

 

If `./subpath/index.cts` or `./subpath.d.cts` exists, resolution is complete. Otherwise, resolution searches `node_modules/@types/pkg` and other `node_modules` directories in an attempt to resolve types, according to the `node_modules` package lookups rules. If no types are found, a second pass through all `node_modules` resolves to `./subpath/index.cjs` (assuming it exists), which counts as a successful resolution, but one that does not provide types, leading to `any`-typed imports and a `noImplicitAny` error if enabled.

 Example: explicit `"types"` condition 

Scenario: `"pkg/subpath"` is requested with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "exports": {    "./subpath": {      "import": {        "types": "./types/subpath/index.d.mts",        "default": "./es/subpath/index.mjs"      },      "require": {        "types": "./types/subpath/index.d.cts",        "default": "./cjs/subpath/index.cjs"      }    }  }}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- Does `"exports"` have a `"./subpath"` entry? Yes. 

- The value at `exports["./subpath"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"import"` match this request? Yes. 

- The value at `exports["./subpath"].import` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"types"` match this request? Yes. 

- Does the path `"./types/subpath/index.d.mts"` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `"./types/subpath/index.d.mts"` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

 Example: versioned `"types"` condition 

Scenario: using TypeScript 4.7.5, `"pkg/subpath"` is requested with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "exports": {    "./subpath": {      "types@>=5.2": "./ts5.2/subpath/index.d.ts",      "types@>=4.6": "./ts4.6/subpath/index.d.ts",      "types": "./tsold/subpath/index.d.ts",      "default": "./dist/subpath/index.js"    }  }}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- Does `"exports"` have a `"./subpath"` entry? Yes. 

- The value at `exports["./subpath"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"types@>=5.2"` match this request? No, 4.7.5 is not greater than or equal to 5.2. 

- Does the second condition `"types@>=4.6"` match this request? Yes, 4.7.5 is greater than or equal to 4.6. 

- Does the path `"./ts4.6/subpath/index.d.ts"` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `"./ts4.6/subpath/index.d.ts"` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

 Example: subpath patterns 

Scenario: `"pkg/wildcard.js"` is requested with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "type": "module",  "exports": {    "./*.js": {      "types": "./types/*.d.ts",      "default": "./dist/*.js"    }  }}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- Does `"exports"` have a `"./wildcard.js"` entry? No. 

- Does any key with a `*` in it match `"./wildcard.js"`? Yes, `"./*.js"` matches and sets `wildcard` to be the substitution. 

- The value at `exports["./*.js"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"types"` match this request? Yes. 

- In `./types/*.d.ts`, replace `*` with the substitution `wildcard`. `./types/wildcard.d.ts` 

- Does the path `"./types/wildcard.d.ts"` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `"./types/wildcard.d.ts"` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

 Example: `"exports"` block other subpaths 

Scenario: `"pkg/dist/index.js"` is requested in a package directory with the following package.json:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "main": "./dist/index.js",  "exports": "./dist/index.js"}
```



Resolution process within the package directory:

- Does `"exports"` exist? Yes. 

- The value at `exports` is a string—it must be a file path for the package root (`"."`).

- Is the request `"pkg/dist/index.js"` for the package root? No, it has a subpath `dist/index.js`. 

- Resolution fails; return `undefined`.

Without `"exports"`, the request could have succeeded, but the presence of `"exports"` prevents resolving any subpaths that cannot be matched through `"exports"`.

#### package.json `"typesVersions"`

A `node_modules` package or directory module may specify a `"typesVersions"` field in its package.json to redirect TypeScript’s resolution process according to the TypeScript compiler version, and for `node_modules` packages, according to the subpath being resolved. This allows package authors to include new TypeScript syntax in one set of type definitions while providing another set for backward compatibility with older TypeScript versions (through a tool like downlevel-dts ). `"typesVersions"` is supported in all `moduleResolution` modes; however, the field is not read in situations when package.json `"exports"` are read.

 Example: redirect all requests to a subdirectory 

Scenario: a module imports `"pkg"` using TypeScript 5.2, where `node_modules/pkg/package.json` is:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "version": "1.0.0",  "types": "./index.d.ts",  "typesVersions": {    ">=3.1": {      "*": ["ts3.1/*"]    }  }}
```



Resolution process:

- (Depending on compiler options) Does `"exports"` exist? No. 

- Does `"typesVersions"` exist? Yes. 

- Is the TypeScript version `>=3.1`? Yes. Remember the mapping `"*": ["ts3.1/*"]`. 

- Are we resolving a subpath after the package name? No, just the root `"pkg"`. 

- Does `"types"` exist? Yes. 

- Does any key in `"typesVersions"` match `./index.d.ts`? Yes, `"*"` matches and sets `index.d.ts` to be the substitution. 

- In `ts3.1/*`, replace `*` with the substitution `./index.d.ts`: `ts3.1/index.d.ts` .

- Does the path `./ts3.1/index.d.ts` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `./ts3.1/index.d.ts` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

 Example: redirect requests for a specific file 

Scenario: a module imports `"pkg"` using TypeScript 3.9, where `node_modules/pkg/package.json` is:



```id
json{  "name": "pkg",  "version": "1.0.0",  "types": "./index.d.ts",  "typesVersions": {    "<4.0": { "index.d.ts": ["index.v3.d.ts"] }  }}
```



Resolution process:

- (Depending on compiler options) Does `"exports"` exist? No. 

- Does `"typesVersions"` exist? Yes. 

- Is the TypeScript version ` Yes. Remember the mapping `"index.d.ts": ["index.v3.d.ts"]`. 

- Are we resolving a subpath after the package name? No, just the root `"pkg"`. 

- Does `"types"` exist? Yes. 

- Does any key in `"typesVersions"` match `./index.d.ts`? Yes, `"index.d.ts"` matches. 

- Does the path `./index.v3.d.ts` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? Yes, so don’t use extension substitution. 

- Return the path `./index.v3.d.ts` if the file exists, `undefined` otherwise.

#### package.json `"main"` and `"types"`

If a directory’s package.json `"exports"` field is not read (either due to compiler options, or because it is not present, or because the directory is being resolved as a directory module instead of a `node_modules` package ) and the module specifier does not have a subpath after the package name or package.json-containing directory, TypeScript will attempt to resolve from these package.json fields, in order, in an attempt to find the main module for the package or directory:

- `"types"`

- `"typings"` (legacy)

- `"main"`

The declaration file found at `"types"` is assumed to be an accurate representation of the implementation file found at `"main"`. If `"types"` and `"typings"` are not present or cannot be resolved, TypeScript will read the `"main"` field and perform extension substitution to find a declaration file.

When publishing a typed package to npm, it’s recommended to include a `"types"` field even if extension substitution or package.json `"exports"` make it unnecessary, because npm shows a TS icon on the package registry listing only if the package.json contains a `"types"` field.

#### Package-relative file paths

If neither package.json `"exports"` nor package.json `"typesVersions"` apply, subpaths of a bare package specifier resolve relative to the package directory, according to applicable relative path resolution rules. In modes that respect [package.json `"exports"`], this behavior is blocked by the mere presence of the `"exports"` field in the package’s package.json, even if the import fails to resolve through `"exports"`, as demonstrated in an example above . On the other hand, if the import fails to resolve through `"typesVersions"`, a package-relative file path resolution is attempted as a fallback.

When package-relative paths are supported, they resolve under the same rules as any other relative path considering the `moduleResolution` mode and context. For example, in `--moduleResolution nodenext` , directory modules and extensionless paths are only supported in `require` calls, not in `import`s:



```id
ts// @Filename: module.mtsimport "pkg/dist/foo";                // ❌ import, needs `.js` extensionimport "pkg/dist/foo.js";             // ✅import foo = require("pkg/dist/foo"); // ✅ require, no extension needed
```



#### package.json `"imports"` and self-name imports

When `moduleResolution` is set to `node16`, `nodenext`, or `bundler`, and `resolvePackageJsonImports` is not disabled, TypeScript will attempt to resolve import paths beginning with `#` through the `"imports"` field of the nearest ancestor package.json of the importing file. Similarly, when package.json `"exports"` lookups are enabled, TypeScript will attempt to resolve import paths beginning with the current package name—that is, the value in the `"name"` field of the nearest ancestor package.json of the importing file—through the `"exports"` field of that package.json. Both of these features allow files in a package to import other files in the same package, replacing a relative import path.

TypeScript follows Node.js’s resolution algorithm for `"imports"` and self references exactly up until a file path is resolved. At that point, TypeScript’s resolution algorithm forks based on whether the package.json containing the `"imports"` or `"exports"` being resolved belongs to a `node_modules` dependency or the local project being compiled (i.e., its directory contains the tsconfig.json file for the project that contains the importing file):

- If the package.json is in `node_modules`, TypeScript will apply extension substitution to the file path if it doesn’t already have a recognized TypeScript file extension, and check for the existence of the resulting file paths.

- If the package.json is part of the local project, an additional remapping step is performed in order to find the input TypeScript implementation file that will eventually produce the output JavaScript or declaration file path that was resolved from `"imports"`. Without this step, any compilation that resolves an `"imports"` path would be referencing output files from the previous compilation instead of other input files that are intended to be included in the current compilation. This remapping uses the `outDir`/`declarationDir` and `rootDir` from the tsconfig.json, so using `"imports"` usually requires an explicit `rootDir` to be set.

This variation allows package authors to write `"imports"` and `"exports"` fields that reference only the compilation outputs that will be published to npm, while still allowing local development to use the original TypeScript source files.

 Example: local project with conditions 

Scenario: `"/src/main.mts"` imports `"#utils"` with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) in a project directory with a tsconfig.json and package.json:



```id
json// tsconfig.json{  "compilerOptions": {    "moduleResolution": "node16",    "resolvePackageJsonImports": true,    "rootDir": "./src",    "outDir": "./dist"  }}
```




```id
json// package.json{  "name": "pkg",  "imports": {    "#utils": {      "import": "./dist/utils.d.mts",      "require": "./dist/utils.d.cts"    }  }}
```



Resolution process:

- Import path starts with `#`, try to resolve through `"imports"`.

- Does `"imports"` exist in the nearest ancestor package.json? Yes. 

- Does `"#utils"` exist in the `"imports"` object? Yes. 

- The value at `imports["#utils"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"import"` match this request? Yes. 

- Should we attempt to map the output path to an input path? Yes, because: 

 Is the package.json in `node_modules`? No, it’s in the local project. 

- Is the tsconfig.json within the package.json directory? Yes. 

 
- In `./dist/utils.d.mts`, replace the `outDir` prefix with `rootDir`. `./src/utils.d.mts` 

- Replace the output extension `.d.mts` with the corresponding input extension `.mts`. `./src/utils.mts` 

- Return the path `"./src/utils.mts"` if the file exists.

- Otherwise, return the path `"./dist/utils.d.mts"` if the file exists.

 Example: `node_modules` dependency with subpath pattern 

Scenario: `"/node_modules/pkg/main.mts"` imports `"#internal/utils"` with conditions `["types", "node", "import"]` (determined by `moduleResolution` setting and the context that triggered the module resolution request) with the package.json:



```id
json// /node_modules/pkg/package.json{  "name": "pkg",  "imports": {    "#internal/*": {      "import": "./dist/internal/*.mjs",      "require": "./dist/internal/*.cjs"    }  }}
```



Resolution process:

- Import path starts with `#`, try to resolve through `"imports"`.

- Does `"imports"` exist in the nearest ancestor package.json? Yes. 

- Does `"#internal/utils"` exist in the `"imports"` object? No, check for pattern matches. 

- Does any key with a `*` match `"#internal/utils"`? Yes, `"#internal/*"` matches and sets `utils` to be the substitution. 

- The value at `imports["#internal/*"]` is an object—it must be specifying conditions.

- Does the first condition `"import"` match this request? Yes. 

- Should we attempt to map the output path to an input path? No, because the package.json is in `node_modules`. 

- In `./dist/internal/*.mjs`, replace `*` with the substitution `utils`. `./dist/internal/utils.mjs` 

- Does the path `./dist/internal/utils.mjs` have a recognized TypeScript file extension? No, try extension substitution. 

- Via extension substitution , try the following paths, returning the first one that exists, or `undefined` otherwise:

 `./dist/internal/utils.mts`

- `./dist/internal/utils.d.mts`

- `./dist/internal/utils.mjs`

 

### `node16`, `nodenext`

These modes reflect the module resolution behavior of Node.js v12 and later. (`node16` and `nodenext` are currently identical, but if Node.js makes significant changes to its module system in the future, `node16` will be frozen while `nodenext` will be updated to reflect the new behavior.) In Node.js, the resolution algorithm for ECMAScript imports is significantly different from the algorithm for CommonJS `require` calls. For each module specifier being resolved, the syntax and the module format of the importing file are first used to determine whether the module specifier will be in an `import` or `require` in the emitted JavaScript. That information is then passed into the module resolver to determine which resolution algorithm to use (and whether to use the `"import"` or `"require"` condition for package.json `"exports"` or `"imports"` ).

 

TypeScript files that are determined to be in CommonJS format may still use `import` and `export` syntax by default, but the emitted JavaScript will use `require` and `module.exports` instead. This means that it’s common to see `import` statements that are resolved using the `require` algorithm. If this causes confusion, the `verbatimModuleSyntax` compiler option can be enabled, which prohibits the use of `import` statements that would be emitted as `require` calls.

 

Note that dynamic `import()` calls are always resolved using the `import` algorithm, according to Node.js’s behavior. However, `import()` types are resolved according to the format of the importing file (for backward compatibility with existing CommonJS-format type declarations):



```id
ts// @Filename: module.mtsimport x from "./mod.js";             // `import` algorithm due to file format (emitted as-written)import("./mod.js");                   // `import` algorithm due to syntax (emitted as-written)type Mod = typeof import("./mod.js"); // `import` algorithm due to file formatimport mod = require("./mod");        // `require` algorithm due to syntax (emitted as `require`)// @Filename: commonjs.ctsimport x from "./mod";                // `require` algorithm due to file format (emitted as `require`)import("./mod.js");                   // `import` algorithm due to syntax (emitted as-written)type Mod = typeof import("./mod");    // `require` algorithm due to file formatimport mod = require("./mod");        // `require` algorithm due to syntax (emitted as `require`)
```

### `bundler`

`--moduleResolution bundler` attempts to model the module resolution behavior common to most JavaScript bundlers. In short, this means supporting all the behaviors traditionally associated with Node.js’s CommonJS `require` resolution algorithm like `node_modules` lookups , directory modules , and extensionless paths , while also supporting newer Node.js resolution features like package.json `"exports"` and package.json `"imports"` .

It’s instructive to think about the similarities and differences between `--moduleResolution bundler` and `--moduleResolution nodenext`, particularly in how they decide what conditions to use when resolving package.json `"exports"` or `"imports"`. Consider an import statement in a `.ts` file:



```id
ts// index.tsimport { foo } from "pkg";
```



Recall that in `--module nodenext --moduleResolution nodenext`, the `--module` setting first determines whether the import will be emitted to the `.js` file as an `import` or `require` call, then passes that information to TypeScript’s module resolver, which decides whether to match `"import"` or `"require"` conditions in `"pkg"`’s package.json `"exports"` accordingly. Let’s assume that there’s no package.json in scope of this file. The file extension is `.ts`, so the output file extension will be `.js`, which Node.js will interpret as CommonJS, so TypeScript will emit this `import` as a `require` call. So, the module resolver will use the `require` condition as it resolves `"exports"` from `"pkg"`.

The same process happens in `--moduleResolution bundler`, but the rules for deciding whether to emit an `import` or `require` call for this import statement will be different, since `--moduleResolution bundler` necessitates using `--module esnext` or `--module preserve` . In both of those modes, ESM `import` declarations always emit as ESM `import` declarations, so TypeScript’s module resolver will receive that information and use the `"import"` condition as it resolves `"exports"` from `"pkg"`.

This explanation may be somewhat unintuitive, since `--moduleResolution bundler` is usually used in combination with `--noEmit`—bundlers typically process raw `.ts` files and perform module resolution on untransformed `import`s or `require`s. However, for consistency, TypeScript still uses the hypothetical emit decided by `module` to inform module resolution and type checking. This makes `--module preserve` the best choice whenever a runtime or bundler is operating on raw `.ts` files, since it implies no transformation. Under `--module preserve --moduleResolution bundler`, you can write imports and requires in the same file that will resolve with the `import` and `require` conditions, respectively:



```id
ts// index.tsimport pkg1 from "pkg";       // Resolved with "import" conditionimport pkg2 = require("pkg"); // Resolved with "require" condition
```



#### Implied and enforced options

# Modules - ESM/CJS Interoperability

 

It’s 2015, and you’re writing an ESM-to-CJS transpiler. There’s no specification for how to do this; all you have is a specification of how ES modules are supposed to interact with each other, knowledge of how CommonJS modules interact with each other, and a knack for figuring things out. Consider an exporting ES module:



```id
tsexport const A = {};export const B = {};export default "Hello, world!";
```



How would you turn this into a CommonJS module? Recalling that default exports are just named exports with special syntax, there seems to be only one choice:



```id
tsexports.A = {};exports.B = {};exports.default = "Hello, world!";
```



This is a nice analog, and it lets you implement a similar on the importing side:



```id
tsimport hello, { A, B } from "./module";console.log(hello, A, B);// transpiles to:const module_1 = require("./module");console.log(module_1.default, module_1.A, module_1.B);
```



So far, everything in CJS-world matches up one-to-one with everything in ESM-world. Extending the equivalence above one step further, we can see that we also have:



```id
tsimport * as mod from "./module";console.log(mod.default, mod.A, mod.B);// transpiles to:const mod = require("./module");console.log(mod.default, mod.A, mod.B);
```



You might notice that in this scheme, there’s no way to write an ESM export that produces an output where `exports` is assigned a function, class, or primitive:



```id
ts// @Filename: exports-function.jsmodule.exports = function hello() {  console.log("Hello, world!");};
```



But existing CommonJS modules frequently take this form. How might an ESM import, processed with our transpiler, access this module? We just established that a namespace import (`import *`) transpiles to a plain `require` call, so we can support an input like:



```id
tsimport * as hello from "./exports-function";hello();// transpiles to:const hello = require("./exports-function");hello();
```



Our output works at runtime, but we have a compliance problem: according to the JavaScript specification, a namespace import always resolves to a Module Namespace Object , that is, an object whose members are the exports of the module. In this case, `require` would return the function `hello`, but `import *` can never return a function. The correspondence we assumed appears invalid.

It’s worth taking a step back here and clarifying what the goal is. As soon as modules landed in the ES2015 specification, transpilers emerged with support for downleveling ESM to CJS, allowing users to adopt the new syntax long before runtimes implemented support for it. There was even a sense that writing ESM code was a good way to “future-proof” new projects. For this to be true, there needed to be a seamless migration path from executing the transpilers’ CJS output to executing the ESM input natively once runtimes developed support for it. The goal was to find a way to downlevel ESM to CJS that would allow any or all of those transpiled outputs to be replaced by their true ESM inputs in a future runtime, with no observable change in behavior.

By following the specification, it was easy enough for transpilers to find a set of transformations that made the semantics of their transpiled CommonJS outputs match the specified semantics of their ESM inputs (arrows represent imports):

 

However, CommonJS modules (written as CommonJS, not as ESM transpiled to CommonJS) were already well-established in the Node.js ecosystem, so it was inevitable that modules written as ESM and transpiled to CJS would start “importing” modules written as CommonJS. The behavior for this interoperability, though, was not specified by ES2015, and didn’t yet exist in any real runtime.

 

Even if transpiler authors did nothing, a behavior would emerge from the existing semantics between the `require` calls they emitted in transpiled code and the `exports` defined in existing CJS modules. And to allow users to transition seamlessly from transpiled ESM to true ESM once their runtime supported it, that behavior would have to match the one the runtime chose to implement.

Guessing what interop behavior runtimes would support wasn’t limited to ESM importing “true CJS” modules either. Whether ESM would be able to recognize ESM-transpiled-from-CJS as distinct from CJS, and whether CJS would be able to `require` ES modules, were also unspecified. Even whether ESM imports would use the same module resolution algorithm as CJS `require` calls was unknowable. All these variables would have to be predicted correctly in order to give transpiler users a seamless migration path toward native ESM.

## `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` and `esModuleInterop`

Let’s return to our specification compliance problem, where `import *` transpiles to `require`:



```id
ts// Invalid according to the spec:import * as hello from "./exports-function";hello();// but the transpilation works:const hello = require("./exports-function");hello();
```



When TypeScript first added support for writing and transpiling ES modules, the compiler addressed this problem by issuing an error on any namespace import of a module whose `exports` was not a namespace-like object:



```id
tsimport * as hello from "./exports-function";// TS2497              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^// External module '"./exports-function"' resolves to a non-module entity// and cannot be imported using this construct.
```



The only workaround was for users to go back to using the older TypeScript import syntax representing a CommonJS `require`:



```id
tsimport hello = require("./exports-function");
```



Forcing users to revert to non-ESM syntax was essentially an admission that “we don’t know how or if a CJS module like `"./exports-function"` will be accessible with ESM imports in the future, but we know it can’t be with `import *`, even though it will work at runtime in the transpilation scheme we’re using.” It doesn’t meet the goal of allowing this file to be migrated to real ESM without changes, but neither does the alternative of allowing the `import *` to link to a function. This is still the behavior in TypeScript today when `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` and `esModuleInterop` are disabled.

 

Unfortunately, this is a slight oversimplification—TypeScript didn’t fully avoid the compliance issue with this error, because it allowed namespace imports of functions to work, and retain their call signatures, as long as the function declaration merged with a namespace declaration—even if the namespace was empty. So while a module exporting a bare function was recognized as a “non-module entity”:



```id
tsdeclare function $(selector: string): any;export = $; // Cannot `import *` this 👍
```



A should-be-meaningless change allowed the invalid import to type check without errors:



```id
tsdeclare namespace $ {}declare function $(selector: string): any;export = $; // Allowed to `import *` this and call it 😱
```


 

Meanwhile, other transpilers were coming up with a way to solve the same problem. The thought process went something like this:

 To import a CJS module that exports a function or a primitive, we clearly need to use a default import. A namespace import would be illegal, and named imports don’t make sense here.

- Most likely, this means that runtimes implementing ESM/CJS interop will choose to make default imports of CJS modules always link directly to the whole `exports`, rather than only doing so if the `exports` is a function or primitive.

- So, a default import of a true CJS module should work just like a `require` call. But we’ll need a way to disambiguate true CJS modules from our transpiled CJS modules, so we can still transpile `export default "hello"` to `exports.default = "hello"` and have a default import of that module link to `exports.default`. Basically, a default import of one of our own transpiled modules needs to work one way (to simulate ESM-to-ESM imports), while a default import of any other existing CJS module needs to work another way (to simulate how we think ESM-to-CJS imports will work).

- When we transpile an ES module to CJS, let’s add a special extra field to the output:


```id
tsexports.A = {};exports.B = {};exports.default = "Hello, world!";// Extra special flag!exports.__esModule = true;
```


that we can check for when we transpile a default import:


```id
ts// import hello from "./module";const _mod = require("./module");const hello = _mod.__esModule ? _mod.default : _mod;
```



The `__esModule` flag first appeared in Traceur, then in Babel, SystemJS, and Webpack shortly after. TypeScript added the `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` in 1.8 to allow the type checker to link default imports directly to the `exports`, rather than the `exports.default`, of any module types that lacked an `export default` declaration. The flag didn’t modify how imports or exports were emitted, but it allowed default imports to reflect how other transpilers would treat them. Namely, it allowed a default import to be used to resolve to “non-module entities,” where `import *` was an error:



```id
ts// Error:import * as hello from "./exports-function";// Old workaround:import hello = require("./exports-function");// New way, with `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`:import hello from "./exports-function";
```



This was usually enough to let Babel and Webpack users write code that already worked in those systems without TypeScript complaining, but it was only a partial solution, leaving a few issues unsolved:

- Babel and others varied their default import behavior on whether an `__esModule` property was found on the target module, but `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` only enabled a fallback behavior when no default export was found in the target module’s types. This created an inconsistency if the target module had an `__esModule` flag but no default export. Transpilers and bundlers would still link a default import of such a module to its `exports.default`, which would be `undefined`, and would ideally be an error in TypeScript, since real ESM imports cause errors if they can’t be linked. But with `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`, TypeScript would think a default import of such an import links to the whole `exports` object, allowing named exports to be accessed as its properties.

- `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` didn’t change how namespace imports were typed, creating an odd inconsistency where both could be used and would have the same type:


```id
ts// @Filename: exportEqualsObject.d.tsdeclare const obj: object;export = obj;// @Filename: main.tsimport objDefault from "./exportEqualsObject";import * as objNamespace from "./exportEqualsObject";// This should be true at runtime, but TypeScript gives an error:objNamespace.default === objDefault;//           ^^^^^^^ Property 'default' does not exist on type 'typeof import("./exportEqualsObject")'.
```



- Most importantly, `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` did not change the JavaScript emitted by `tsc`. So while the flag enabled more accurate checking as long as the code was fed into another tool like Babel or Webpack, it created a real danger for users who were emitting `--module commonjs` with `tsc` and running in Node.js. If they encountered an error with `import *`, it may have appeared as if enabling `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` would fix it, but in fact it only silenced the build-time error while emitting code that would crash in Node.

TypeScript introduced the `esModuleInterop` flag in 2.7, which refined the type checking of imports to address the remaining inconsistencies between TypeScript’s analysis and the interop behavior used in existing transpilers and bundlers, and critically, adopted the same `__esModule`-conditional CommonJS emit that transpilers had adopted years before. (Another new emit helper for `import *` ensured the result was always an object, with call signatures stripped, fully resolving the specification compliance issue that the aforementioned “resolves to a non-module entity” error didn’t quite sidestep.) Finally, with the new flag enabled, TypeScript’s type checking, TypeScript’s emit, and the rest of the transpiling and bundling ecosystem were in agreement on a CJS/ESM interop scheme that was spec-legal and, perhaps, plausibly adoptable by Node.

## Interop in Node.js

Node.js shipped support for ES modules unflagged in v12. Like the bundlers and transpilers began doing years before, Node.js gave CommonJS modules a “synthetic default export” of their `exports` object, allowing the entire module contents to be accessed with a default import from ESM:



```id
ts// @Filename: export.cjsmodule.exports = { hello: "world" };// @Filename: import.mjsimport greeting from "./export.cjs";greeting.hello; // "world"
```



That’s one win for seamless migration! Unfortunately, the similarities mostly end there.

### No `__esModule` detection (the “double default” problem)

Node.js wasn’t able to respect the `__esModule` marker to vary its default import behavior. So a transpiled module with a “default export” behaves one way when “imported” by another transpiled module, and another way when imported by a true ES module in Node.js:



```id
ts// @Filename: node_modules/dependency/index.jsexports.__esModule = true;exports.default = function doSomething() { /*...*/ }// @Filename: transpile-vs-run-directly.{js/mjs}import doSomething from "dependency";// Works after transpilation, but not a function in Node.js ESM:doSomething();// Doesn't exist after transpilation, but works in Node.js ESM:doSomething.default();
```



While the transpiled default import only makes the synthetic default export if the target module lacks an `__esModule` flag, Node.js always synthesizes a default export, creating a “double default” on the transpiled module.

### Unreliable named exports

In addition to making a CommonJS module’s `exports` object available as a default import, Node.js attempts to find properties of `exports` to make available as named imports. This behavior matches bundlers and transpilers when it works; however, Node.js uses syntactic analysis to synthesize named exports before any code executes, whereas transpiled modules resolve their named imports at runtime. The result is that imports from CJS modules that work in transpiled modules may not work in Node.js:



```id
ts// @Filename: named-exports.cjsexports.hello = "world";exports["worl" + "d"] = "hello";// @Filename: transpile-vs-run-directly.{js/mjs}import { hello, world } from "./named-exports.cjs";// `hello` works, but `world` is missing in Node.js 💥import mod from "./named-exports.cjs";mod.world;// Accessing properties from the default always works ✅
```



### Cannot `require` a true ES module before Node.js v22

True CommonJS modules can `require` an ESM-transpiled-to-CJS module, since they’re both CommonJS at runtime. But in Node.js versions older than v22.12.0, `require` crashes if it resolves to an ES module. This means published libraries cannot migrate from transpiled modules to true ESM without breaking their CommonJS (true or transpiled) consumers:



```id
ts// @Filename: node_modules/dependency/index.jsexport function doSomething() { /* ... */ }// @Filename: dependent.jsimport { doSomething } from "dependency";// ✅ Works if dependent and dependency are both transpiled// ✅ Works if dependent and dependency are both true ESM// ✅ Works if dependent is true ESM and dependency is transpiled// 💥 Crashes if dependent is transpiled and dependency is true ESM
```



### Different module resolution algorithms

Node.js introduced a new module resolution algorithm for resolving ESM imports that differed significantly from the long-standing algorithm for resolving `require` calls. While not directly related to interop between CJS and ES modules, this difference was one more reason why a seamless migration from transpiled modules to true ESM might not be possible:



```id
ts// @Filename: add.jsexport function add(a, b) {  return a + b;}// @Filename: math.jsexport * from "./add";//            ^^^^^^^// Works when transpiled to CJS,// but would have to be "./add.js"// in Node.js ESM.
```



## Conclusions

Clearly, a seamless migration from transpiled modules to ESM isn’t possible, at least in Node.js. Where does this leave us?

### Setting the right `module` compiler option is critical

Since interoperability rules differ between hosts, TypeScript can’t offer correct checking behavior unless it understands what kind of module is represented by each file it sees, and what set of rules to apply to them. This is the purpose of the `module` compiler option. (In particular, code that is intended to run in Node.js is subject to stricter rules than code that will be processed by a bundler. The compiler’s output is not checked for Node.js compatibility unless `module` is set to `node16`, `node18`, or `nodenext`.)

### Applications with CommonJS code should always enable `esModuleInterop`

In a TypeScript application (as opposed to a library that others may consume) where `tsc` is used to emit JavaScript files, whether `esModuleInterop` is enabled doesn’t have major consequences. The way you write imports for certain kinds of modules will change, but TypeScript’s checking and emit are in sync, so error-free code should be safe to run in either mode. The downside of leaving `esModuleInterop` disabled in this case is that it allows you to write JavaScript code with semantics that clearly violate the ECMAScript specification, confusing intuitions about namespace imports and making it harder to migrate to running ES modules in the future.

In an application that gets processed by a third-party transpiler or bundler, on the other hand, enabling `esModuleInterop` is more important. All major bundlers and transpilers use an `esModuleInterop`-like emit strategy, so TypeScript needs to adjust its checking to match. (The compiler always reasons about what will happen in the JavaScript files that `tsc` would emit, so even if another tool is being used in place of `tsc`, emit-affecting compiler options should still be set to match the output of that tool as closely as possible.)

`allowSyntheticDefaultImports` without `esModuleInterop` should be avoided. It changes the compiler’s checking behavior without changing the code emitted by `tsc`, allowing potentially unsafe JavaScript to be emitted. Additionally, the checking changes it introduces are an incomplete version of the ones introduced by `esModuleInterop`. Even if `tsc` isn’t being used for emit, it’s better to enable `esModuleInterop` than `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`.

Some people object to the inclusion of the `__importDefault` and `__importStar` helper functions included in `tsc`’s JavaScript output when `esModuleInterop` is enabled, either because it marginally increases the output size on disk or because the interop algorithm employed by the helpers seems to misrepresent Node.js’s interop behavior by checking for `__esModule`, leading to the hazards discussed earlier. Both of these objections can be addressed, at least partially, without accepting the flawed checking behavior exhibited with `esModuleInterop` disabled. First, the `importHelpers` compiler option can be used to import the helper functions from `tslib` rather than inlining them into each file that needs them. To discuss the second objection, let’s look at a final example:



```id
ts// @Filename: node_modules/transpiled-dependency/index.jsexports.__esModule = true;exports.default = function doSomething() { /* ... */ };exports.something = "something";// @Filename: node_modules/true-cjs-dependency/index.jsmodule.exports = function doSomethingElse() { /* ... */ };// @Filename: src/sayHello.tsexport default function sayHello() { /* ... */ }export const hello = "hello";// @Filename: src/main.tsimport doSomething from "transpiled-dependency";import doSomethingElse from "true-cjs-dependency";import sayHello from "./sayHello.js";
```



Assume we’re compiling `src` to CommonJS for use in Node.js. Without `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` or `esModuleInterop`, the import of `doSomethingElse` from `"true-cjs-dependency"` is an error, and the others are not. To fix the error without changing any compiler options, you could change the import to 

```
import doSomethingElse = require("true-cjs-dependency")
```

. However, depending on how the types for the module (not shown) are written, you may also be able to write and call a namespace import, which would be a language-level specification violation. With `esModuleInterop`, none of the imports shown are errors (and all are callable), but the invalid namespace import would be caught.

What would change if we decided to migrate `src` to true ESM in Node.js (say, add `"type": "module"` to our root package.json)? The first import, `doSomething` from `"transpiled-dependency"`, would no longer be callable—it exhibits the “double default” problem, where we’d have to call `doSomething.default()` rather than `doSomething()`. (TypeScript understands and catches this under `--module node16`—`nodenext`.) But notably, the second import of `doSomethingElse`, which needed `esModuleInterop` to work when compiling to CommonJS, works fine in true ESM.

If there’s something to complain about here, it’s not what `esModuleInterop` does with the second import. The changes it makes, both allowing the default import and preventing callable namespace imports, are exactly in line with Node.js’s real ESM/CJS interop strategy, and made migration to real ESM easier. The problem, if there is one, is that `esModuleInterop` seems to fail at giving us a seamless migration path for the first import. But this problem was not introduced by enabling `esModuleInterop`; the first import was completely unaffected by it. Unfortunately, this problem cannot be solved without breaking the semantic contract between `main.ts` and `sayHello.ts`, because the CommonJS output of `sayHello.ts` looks structurally identical to `transpiled-dependency/index.js`. If `esModuleInterop` changed the way the transpiled import of `doSomething` works to be identical to the way it would work in Node.js ESM, it would change the behavior of the `sayHello` import in the same way, making the input code violate ESM semantics (thus still preventing the `src` directory from being migrated to ESM without changes).

As we’ve seen, there is no seamless migration path from transpiled modules to true ESM. But `esModuleInterop` is one step in the right direction. For those who still prefer to minimize module syntax transformations and the inclusion of the import helper functions, enabling `verbatimModuleSyntax` is a better choice than disabling `esModuleInterop`. `verbatimModuleSyntax` enforces that the `import mod = require("mod")` and `export = ns` syntax be used in CommonJS-emitting files, avoiding all the kinds of import ambiguity we’ve discussed, at the cost of ease of migration to true ESM.

### Library code needs special considerations

Libraries that ship as CommonJS should avoid using default exports, since the way those transpiled exports can be accessed varies between different tools and runtimes, and some of those ways will look confusing to users. A default export, transpiled to CommonJS by `tsc`, is accessible in Node.js as the default property of a default import:



```id
jsimport pkg from "pkg";pkg.default();
```



in most bundlers or transpiled ESM as the default import itself:



```id
jsimport pkg from "pkg";pkg();
```



and in vanilla CommonJS as the default property of a `require` call:



```id
jsconst pkg = require("pkg");pkg.default();
```



Users will detect a misconfigured module smell if they have to access the `.default` property of a default import, and if they’re trying to write code that will run both in Node.js and a bundler, they might be stuck. Some third-party TypeScript transpilers expose options that change the way default exports are emitted to mitigate this difference, but they don’t produce their own declaration (`.d.ts`) files, so that creates a mismatch between the runtime behavior and the type checking, further confusing and frustrating users. Instead of using default exports, libraries that need to ship as CommonJS should use `export =` for modules that have a single main export, or named exports for modules that have multiple exports:



```id
diff- export default function doSomething() { /* ... */ }+ export = function doSomething() { /* ... */ }
```



Libraries (that ship declaration files) should also take extra care to ensure the types they write are error-free under a wide range of compiler options. For example, it’s possible to write one interface that extends another in such a way that it only compiles successfully when `strictNullChecks` is disabled. If a library were to publish types like that, it would force all their users to disable `strictNullChecks` too. `esModuleInterop` can allow type declarations to contain similarly “infectious” default imports:



```id
ts// @Filename: /node_modules/dependency/index.d.tsimport express from "express";declare function doSomething(req: express.Request): any;export = doSomething;
```



Suppose this default import only works with `esModuleInterop` enabled, and causes an error when a user without that option references this file. The user should probably enable `esModuleInterop` anyway, but it’s generally seen as bad form for libraries to make their configurations infectious like this. It would be much better for the library to ship a declaration file like:



```id
tsimport express = require("express");// ...
```



Examples like this have led to conventional wisdom that says libraries should not enable `esModuleInterop`. This advice is a reasonable start, but we’ve looked at examples where the type of a namespace import changes, potentially introducing an error, when enabling `esModuleInterop`. So whether libraries compile with or without `esModuleInterop`, they run the risk of writing syntax that makes their choice infectious.

Library authors who want to go above and beyond to ensure maximum compatibility would do well to validate their declaration files against a matrix of compiler options. But using `verbatimModuleSyntax` completely sidesteps the issue with `esModuleInterop` by forcing CommonJS-emitting files to use CommonJS-style import and export syntax. Additionally, since `esModuleInterop` only affects CommonJS, as more libraries move to ESM-only publishing over time, the relevance of this issue will decline.

# TypeScript 5.8

 

## Granular Checks for Branches in Return Expressions

Consider some code like the following:



```id
tsdeclare const untypedCache: Map<any, any>;function getUrlObject(urlString: string): URL {    return untypedCache.has(urlString) ?        untypedCache.get(urlString) :        urlString;}
```



The intent of this code is to retrieve a URL object from a cache if it exists, or to create a new URL object if it doesn’t.
However, there’s a bug: we forgot to actually construct a new URL object with the input.
Unfortunately, TypeScript generally didn’t catch this sort of bug.

When TypeScript checks conditional expressions like `cond ? trueBranch : falseBranch`, its type is treated as a union of the types of the two branches.
In other words, it gets the type of `trueBranch` and `falseBranch`, and combines them into a union type.
In this case, the type of `untypedCache.get(urlString)` is `any`, and the type of `urlString` is `string`.
This is where things go wrong because `any` is so infectious in how it interacts with other types.
The union `any | string` is simplified to `any`, so by the time TypeScript starts checking whether the expression in our `return` statement is compatible with the expected return type of `URL`, the type system has lost any information that would have caught the bug in this code.

In TypeScript 5.8, the type system special-cases conditional expressions directly inside `return` statements.
Each branch of the conditional is checked against the declared return type of the containing functions (if one exists), so the type system can catch the bug in the example above.



```id
tsdeclare const untypedCache: Map<any, any>;function getUrlObject(urlString: string): URL {    return untypedCache.has(urlString) ?        untypedCache.get(urlString) :        urlString;    //  ~~~~~~~~~    // error! Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'URL'.}
```



This change was made within this pull request , as part of a broader set of future improvements for TypeScript.

## Support for `require()` of ECMAScript Modules in `--module nodenext`

For years, Node.js supported ECMAScript modules (ESM) alongside CommonJS modules.
Unfortunately, the interoperability between the two had some challenges.

 ESM files could `import` CommonJS files

- CommonJS files could not `require()` ESM files

In other words, consuming CommonJS files from ESM files was possible, but not the other way around.
This introduced many challenges for library authors who wanted to provide ESM support.
These library authors would either have to break compatibility with CommonJS users, “dual-publish” their libraries (providing separate entry-points for ESM and CommonJS), or just stay on CommonJS indefinitely.
While dual-publishing might sound like a good middle-ground, it is a complex and error-prone process that also roughly doubles the amount of code within a package.

Node.js 22 relaxes some of these restrictions and permits `require("esm")` calls from CommonJS modules to ECMAScript modules.
Node.js still does not permit `require()` on ESM files that contain a top-level `await`, but most other ESM files are now consumable from CommonJS files.
This presents a major opportunity for library authors to provide ESM support without having to dual-publish their libraries.

TypeScript 5.8 supports this behavior under the `--module nodenext` flag.
When `--module nodenext` is enabled, TypeScript will avoid issuing errors on these `require()` calls to ESM files.

Because this feature may be back-ported to older versions of Node.js, there is currently no stable `--module nodeXXXX` option that enables this behavior;
however, we predict future versions of TypeScript may be able to stabilize the feature under `node20`.
In the meantime, we encourage users of Node.js 22 and newer to use `--module nodenext`, while library authors and users of older Node.js versions should remain on `--module node16` (or make the minor update to `--module node18` ).

For more information, see our support for require(“esm”) here .

## `--module node18`

TypeScript 5.8 introduces a stable `--module node18` flag.
For users who are fixed on using Node.js 18, this flag provides a stable point of reference that does not incorporate certain behaviors that are in `--module nodenext`.
Specifically:

- `require()` of ECMAScript modules is disallowed under `node18`, but allowed under `nodenext`

- import assertions (deprecated in favor of import attributes) are allowed under `node18`, but are disallowed under `nodenext`

See more at both the `--module node18` pull request and changes made to `--module nodenext` .

## The `--erasableSyntaxOnly` Option

Recently, Node.js 23.6 unflagged experimental support for running TypeScript files directly ;
however, only certain constructs are supported under this mode.
Node.js has unflagged a mode called `--experimental-strip-types` which requires that any TypeScript-specific syntax cannot have runtime semantics.
Phrased differently, it must be possible to easily erase or “strip out” any TypeScript-specific syntax from a file, leaving behind a valid JavaScript file.

That means constructs like the following are not supported:

- `enum` declarations

- `namespace`s and `module`s with runtime code

- parameter properties in classes

- Non-ECMAScript `import =` and `export =` assignments

Here are some examples of what does not work:



```id
ts// ❌ error: An `import ... = require(...)` aliasimport foo = require("foo");// ❌ error: A namespace with runtime code.namespace container {}// ❌ error: An `import =` aliasimport Bar = container.Bar;class Point {    // ❌ error: Parameter properties    constructor(public x: number, public y: number) { }}// ❌ error: An `export =` assignment.export = Point;// ❌ error: An enum declaration.enum Direction {    Up,    Down,    Left,    Right,}
```



Similar tools like ts-blank-space or Amaro (the underlying library for type-stripping in Node.js) have the same limitations.
These tools will provide helpful error messages if they encounter code that doesn’t meet these requirements, but you still won’t find out your code doesn’t work until you actually try to run it.

That’s why TypeScript 5.8 introduces the `--erasableSyntaxOnly` flag.
When this flag is enabled, TypeScript will error on most TypeScript-specific constructs that have runtime behavior.



```id
tsclass C {    constructor(public x: number) { }    //          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    // error! This syntax is not allowed when 'erasableSyntaxOnly' is enabled.    }}
```



Typically, you will want to combine this flag with the `--verbatimModuleSyntax`, which ensures that a module contains the appropriate import syntax, and that import elision does not take place.

For more information, see the implementation here .

## The `--libReplacement` Flag

In TypeScript 4.5, we introduced the possibility of substituting the default `lib` files with custom ones.
This was based on the possibility of resolving a library file from packages named `@typescript/lib-*`.
For example, you could lock your `dom` libraries onto a specific version of the `@types/web` package with the following `package.json`:



```id
json{    "devDependencies": {       "@typescript/lib-dom": "npm:@types/web@0.0.199"     }}
```



When installed, a package called `@typescript/lib-dom` should exist, and TypeScript will currently always look it up when `dom` is implied by your settings.

This is a powerful feature, but it also incurs a bit of extra work.
Even if you’re not using this feature, TypeScript always performs this lookup, and has to watch for changes in `node_modules` in case a `lib`-replacement package begins to exist.

TypeScript 5.8 introduces the `--libReplacement` flag, which allows you to disable this behavior.
If you’re not using `--libReplacement`, you can now disable it with `--libReplacement false`.
In the future `--libReplacement false` may become the default, so if you currently rely on the behavior you should consider explicitly enabling it with `--libReplacement true`.

For more information, see the change here .

## Preserved Computed Property Names in Declaration Files

In an effort to make computed properties have more predictable emit in declaration files, TypeScript 5.8 will consistently preserve entity names (`bareVariables` and `dotted.names.that.look.like.this`) in computed property names in classes.

For example, consider the following code:



```id
tsexport let propName = "theAnswer";export class MyClass {    [propName] = 42;//  ~~~~~~~~~~// error!// A computed property name in a class property declaration must have a simple literal type or a 'unique symbol' type.}
```



Previous versions of TypeScript would issue an error when generating a declaration file for this module, and a best-effort declaration file would generate an index signature.



```id
tsexport declare let propName: string;export declare class MyClass {    [x: string]: number;}
```



In TypeScript 5.8, the example code is now allowed, and the emitted declaration file will match what you wrote:



```id
tsexport declare let propName: string;export declare class MyClass {    [propName]: number;}
```



Note that this does not create statically-named properties on the class.
You’ll still end up with what is effectively an index signature like `[x: string]: number`, so for that use case, you’d need to use `unique symbol`s or literal types.

Note that writing this code was and currently is an error under the `--isolatedDeclarations` flag;
but we expect that thanks to this change, computed property names will generally be permitted in declaration emit.

Note that it’s possible (though unlikely) that a file compiled in TypeScript 5.8 may generate a declaration file that is not backward compatible in TypeScript 5.7 or earlier.

For more information, see the implementing PR .

## Optimizations on Program Loads and Updates

TypeScript 5.8 introduces a number of optimizations that can both improve the time to build up a program, and also to update a program based on a file change in either `--watch` mode or editor scenarios.

First, TypeScript now avoids array allocations that would be involved while normalizing paths .
Typically, path normalization would involve segmenting each portion of a path into an array of strings, normalizing the resulting path based on relative segments, and then joining them back together using a canonical separator.
For projects with many files, this can be a significant and repetitive amount of work.
TypeScript now avoids allocating an array, and operates more directly on indexes of the original path.

Additionally, when edits are made that don’t change the fundamental structure of a project, TypeScript now avoids re-validating the options provided to it (e.g. the contents of a `tsconfig.json`).
This means, for example, that a simple edit might not require checking that the output paths of a project don’t conflict with the input paths.
Instead, the results of the last check can be used.
This should make edits in large projects feel more responsive.

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### `lib.d.ts`

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see linked issues related to DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates for this version of TypeScript .

### Restrictions on Import Assertions Under `--module nodenext`

Import assertions were a proposed addition to ECMAScript to ensure certain properties of an import (e.g. “this module is JSON, and is not intended to be executable JavaScript code”).
They were reinvented as a proposal called import attributes .
As part of the transition, they swapped from using the `assert` keyword to using the `with` keyword.



```id
ts// An import assertion ❌ - not future-compatible with most runtimes.import data from "./data.json" assert { type: "json" };// An import attribute ✅ - the preferred way to import a JSON file.import data from "./data.json" with { type: "json" };
```



Node.js 22 no longer accepts import assertions using the `assert` syntax.
In turn when `--module nodenext` is enabled in TypeScript 5.8, TypeScript will issue an error if it encounters an import assertion.



```id
tsimport data from "./data.json" assert { type: "json" };//                             ~~~~~~// error! Import assertions have been replaced by import attributes. Use 'with' instead of 'assert'
```

# TypeScript 5.7

 

## Checks for Never-Initialized Variables

For a long time, TypeScript has been able to catch issues when a variable has not yet been initialized in all prior branches.



```id
tslet result: numberif (someCondition()) {    result = doSomeWork();}else {    let temporaryWork = doSomeWork();    temporaryWork *= 2;    // forgot to assign to 'result'}console.log(result); // error: Variable 'result' is used before being assigned.
```



Unfortunately, there are some places where this analysis doesn’t work.
For example, if the variable is accessed in a separate function, the type system doesn’t know when the function will be called, and instead takes an “optimistic” view that the variable will be initialized.



```id
tsfunction foo() {    let result: number    if (someCondition()) {        result = doSomeWork();    }    else {        let temporaryWork = doSomeWork();        temporaryWork *= 2;        // forgot to assign to 'result'    }    printResult();    function printResult() {        console.log(result); // no error here.    }}
```



While TypeScript 5.7 is still lenient on variables that have possibly been initialized, the type system is able to report errors when variables have never been initialized at all.



```id
tsfunction foo() {    let result: number        // do work, but forget to assign to 'result'    function printResult() {        console.log(result); // error: Variable 'result' is used before being assigned.    }}
```



 This change was contributed thanks to the work of GitHub user Zzzen !

## Path Rewriting for Relative Paths

There are several tools and runtimes that allow you to run TypeScript code “in-place”, meaning they do not require a build step which generates output JavaScript files.
For example, ts-node, tsx, Deno, and Bun all support running `.ts` files directly.
More recently, Node.js has been investigating such support with `--experimental-strip-types` (soon to be unflagged!) and `--experimental-transform-types`.
This is extremely convenient because it allows us to iterate faster without worrying about re-running a build task.

There is some complexity to be aware of when using these modes though.
To be maximally compatible with all these tools, a TypeScript file that’s imported “in-place” must be imported with the appropriate TypeScript extension at runtime.
For example, to import a file called `foo.ts`, we have to write the following in Node’s new experimental support:



```id
ts// main.tsimport * as foo from "./foo.ts"; // <- we need foo.ts here, not foo.js
```



Typically, TypeScript would issue an error if we did this, because it expects us to import the output file .
Because some tools do allow `.ts` imports, TypeScript has supported this import style with an option called `--allowImportingTsExtensions` for a while now.
This works fine, but what happens if we need to actually generate `.js` files out of these `.ts` files?
This is a requirement for library authors who will need to be able to distribute just `.js` files, but up until now TypeScript has avoided rewriting any paths.

To support this scenario, we’ve added a new compiler option called `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`.
When an import path is relative (starts with `./` or `../`), ends in a TypeScript extension (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`), and is a non-declaration file, the compiler will rewrite the path to the corresponding JavaScript extension (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`).



```id
ts// Under --rewriteRelativeImportExtensions...// these will be rewritten.import * as foo from "./foo.ts";import * as bar from "../someFolder/bar.mts";// these will NOT be rewritten in any way.import * as a from "./foo";import * as b from "some-package/file.ts";import * as c from "@some-scope/some-package/file.ts";import * as d from "#/file.ts";import * as e from "./file.js";
```



This allows us to write TypeScript code that can be run in-place and then compiled into JavaScript when we’re ready.

Now, we noted that TypeScript generally avoided rewriting paths.
There are several reasons for this, but the most obvious one is dynamic imports.
If a developer writes the following, it’s not trivial to handle the path that `import` receives.
In fact, it’s impossible to override the behavior of `import` within any dependencies.



```id
tsfunction getPath() {    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {        return "./foo.ts";    }    else {        return "./foo.js";    }}let myImport = await import(getPath());
```



Another issue is that (as we saw above) only relative paths are rewritten, and they are written “naively”.
This means that any path that relies on TypeScript’s `baseUrl` and `paths` will not get rewritten:



```id
json// tsconfig.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "module": "nodenext",        // ...        "paths": {            "@/*": ["./src/*"]        }    }}
```




```id
ts// Won't be transformed, won't work.import * as utilities from "@/utilities.ts";
```



Nor will any path that might resolve through the `exports` and `imports` fields of a `package.json`.



```id
json// package.json{    "name": "my-package",    "imports": {        "#root/*": "./dist/*"    }}
```




```id
ts// Won't be transformed, won't work.import * as utilities from "#root/utilities.ts";
```



As a result, if you’ve been using a workspace-style layout with multiple packages referencing each other, you might need to use conditional exports with scoped custom conditions to make this work:



```id
json// my-package/package.json{    "name": "my-package",    "exports": {        ".": {            "@my-package/development": "./src/index.ts",            "import": "./lib/index.js"        },        "./*": {            "@my-package/development": "./src/*.ts",            "import": "./lib/*.js"        }    }}
```



Any time you want to import the `.ts` files, you can run it with `node --conditions=@my-package/development`.

Note the “namespace” or “scope” we used for the condition `@my-package/development`.
This is a bit of a makeshift solution to avoid conflicts from dependencies that might also use the `development` condition.
If everyone ships a `development` in their package, then resolution may try to resolve to a `.ts` file which will not necessarily work.
This idea is similar to what’s described in Colin McDonnell’s essay Live types in a TypeScript monorepo , along with tshy’s guidance for loading from source .

For more specifics on how this feature works, read up on the change here .

## Support for `--target es2024` and `--lib es2024`

TypeScript 5.7 now supports `--target es2024`, which allows users to target ECMAScript 2024 runtimes.
This target primarily enables specifying the new `--lib es2024` which contains many features for `SharedArrayBuffer` and `ArrayBuffer`, `Object.groupBy`, `Map.groupBy`, `Promise.withResolvers`, and more.
It also moves `Atomics.waitAsync` from `--lib es2022` to `--lib es2024`.

Note that as part of the changes to `SharedArrayBuffer` and `ArrayBuffer`, the two now diverge a bit.
To bridge the gap and preserve the underlying buffer type, all `TypedArrays` (like `Uint8Array` and others) are now also generic .



```id
tsinterface Uint8Array<TArrayBuffer extends ArrayBufferLike = ArrayBufferLike> {    // ...}
```



Each `TypedArray` now contains a type parameter named `TArrayBuffer`, though that type parameter has a default type argument so that we can continue to refer to `Int32Array` without explicitly writing out `Int32Array `.

If you encounter any issues as part of this update, you may need to update `@types/node`.

 This work was primarily provided thanks to Kenta Moriuchi !

## Searching Ancestor Configuration Files for Project Ownership

When a TypeScript file is loaded in an editor using TSServer (like Visual Studio or VS Code), the editor will try to find the relevant `tsconfig.json` file that “owns” the file.
To do this, it walks up the directory tree from the file being edited, looking for any file named `tsconfig.json`.

Previously, this search would stop at the first `tsconfig.json` file found;
however, imagine a project structure like the following:



```
project/├── src/│   ├── foo.ts│   ├── foo-test.ts│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── tsconfig.test.json└── tsconfig.json
```



Here, the idea is that `src/tsconfig.json` is the “main” configuration file for the project, and `src/tsconfig.test.json` is a configuration file for running tests.



```id
json// src/tsconfig.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "../dist"    },    "exclude": ["**/*.test.ts"]}
```




```id
json// src/tsconfig.test.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "../dist/test"    },    "include": ["**/*.test.ts"],    "references": [        { "path": "./tsconfig.json" }    ]}
```




```id
json// tsconfig.json{    // This is a "workspace-style" or "solution-style" tsconfig.    // Instead of specifying any files, it just references all the actual projects.    "files": [],    "references": [        { "path": "./src/tsconfig.json" },        { "path": "./src/tsconfig.test.json" },    ]}
```



The problem here is that when editing `foo-test.ts`, the editor would find `project/src/tsconfig.json` as the “owning” configuration file - but that’s not the one we want!
If the walk stops at this point, that might not be desirable.
The only way to avoid this previously was to rename `src/tsconfig.json` to something like `src/tsconfig.src.json`, and then all files would hit the top-level `tsconfig.json` which references every possible project.



```
project/├── src/│   ├── foo.ts│   ├── foo-test.ts│   ├── tsconfig.src.json│   └── tsconfig.test.json└── tsconfig.json
```



Instead of forcing developers to do this, TypeScript 5.7 now continues walking up the directory tree to find other appropriate `tsconfig.json` files for editor scenarios.
This can provide more flexibility in how projects are organized and how configuration files are structured.

You can get more specifics on the implementation on GitHub here and here .

## Faster Project Ownership Checks in Editors for Composite Projects

Imagine a large codebase with the following structure:



```
packages├── graphics/│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── src/│       └── ...├── sound/│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── src/│       └── ...├── networking/│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── src/│       └── ...├── input/│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── src/│       └── ...└── app/    ├── tsconfig.json    ├── some-script.js    └── src/        └── ...
```



Each directory in `packages` is a separate TypeScript project, and the `app` directory is the main project that depends on all the other projects.



```id
json// app/tsconfig.json{    "compilerOptions": {        // ...    },    "include": ["src"],    "references": [        { "path": "../graphics/tsconfig.json" },        { "path": "../sound/tsconfig.json" },        { "path": "../networking/tsconfig.json" },        { "path": "../input/tsconfig.json" }    ]}
```



Now notice we have the file `some-script.js` in the `app` directory.
When we open `some-script.js` in the editor, the TypeScript language service (which also handles the editor experience for JavaScript files!) has to figure out which project the file belongs to so it can apply the right settings.

In this case, the nearest `tsconfig.json` does not include `some-script.js`, but TypeScript will proceed to ask “could one of the projects referenced by `app/tsconfig.json` include `some-script.js`?“.
To do so, TypeScript would previously load up each project, one-by-one, and stop as soon as it found a project which contained `some-script.js`.
Even if `some-script.js` isn’t included in the root set of files, TypeScript would still parse all the files within a project because some of the root set of files can still transitively reference `some-script.js`.

What we found over time was that this behavior caused extreme and unpredictable behavior in larger codebases.
Developers would open up stray script files and find themselves waiting for their entire codebase to be opened up.

Thankfully, every project that can be referenced by another (non-workspace) project must enable a flag called `composite`, which enforces a rule that all input source files must be known up-front.
So when probing a `composite` project, TypeScript 5.7 will only check if a file belongs to the root set of files of that project.
This should avoid this common worst-case behavior.

For more information, see the change here .

### Validated JSON Imports in `--module nodenext`

When importing from a `.json` file under `--module nodenext`, TypeScript will now enforce certain rules to prevent runtime errors.

For one, an import attribute containing `type: "json"` needs to be present for any JSON file import.



```id
tsimport myConfig from "./myConfig.json";//                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// ❌ error: Importing a JSON file into an ECMAScript module requires a 'type: "json"' import attribute when 'module' is set to 'NodeNext'.import myConfig from "./myConfig.json" with { type: "json" };//                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^// ✅ This is fine because we provided `type: "json"`
```



On top of this validation, TypeScript will not generate “named” exports, and the contents of a JSON import will only be accessible via a default.



```id
ts// ✅ This is okay:import myConfigA from "./myConfig.json" with { type: "json" };let version = myConfigA.version;///////////import * as myConfigB from "./myConfig.json" with { type: "json" };// ❌ This is not:let version = myConfig.version;// ✅ This is okay:let version = myConfig.default.version;
```



 See here for more information on this change.

## Support for V8 Compile Caching in Node.js

Node.js 22 supports a new API called `module.enableCompileCache()` .
This API allows the runtime to reuse some of the parsing and compilation work done after the first run of a tool.

TypeScript 5.7 now leverages the API so that it can start doing useful work sooner.
In some of our own testing, we’ve witnessed about a 2.5x speed-up in running `tsc --version`.



```
Benchmark 1: node ./built/local/_tsc.js --version (*without* caching)  Time (mean ± σ):     122.2 ms ±   1.5 ms    [User: 101.7 ms, System: 13.0 ms]  Range (min … max):   119.3 ms … 132.3 ms    200 runs Benchmark 2: node ./built/local/tsc.js --version  (*with* caching)  Time (mean ± σ):      48.4 ms ±   1.0 ms    [User: 34.0 ms, System: 11.1 ms]  Range (min … max):    45.7 ms …  52.8 ms    200 runs Summary  node ./built/local/tsc.js --version ran    2.52 ± 0.06 times faster than node ./built/local/_tsc.js --version
```

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### `lib.d.ts`

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see linked issues related to DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates for this version of TypeScript .

### `TypedArray`s Are Now Generic Over `ArrayBufferLike`

In ECMAScript 2024, `SharedArrayBuffer` and `ArrayBuffer` have types that slightly diverge.
To bridge the gap and preserve the underlying buffer type, all `TypedArrays` (like `Uint8Array` and others) are now also generic .



```id
tsinterface Uint8Array<TArrayBuffer extends ArrayBufferLike = ArrayBufferLike> {    // ...}
```



Each `TypedArray` now contains a type parameter named `TArrayBuffer`, though that type parameter has a default type argument so that users can continue to refer to `Int32Array` without explicitly writing out `Int32Array `.

If you encounter any issues as part of this update, such as



```
error TS2322: Type 'Buffer' is not assignable to type 'Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'.error TS2345: Argument of type 'Buffer' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'.error TS2345: Argument of type 'ArrayBufferLike' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ArrayBuffer'.error TS2345: Argument of type 'Buffer' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | ArrayBufferView | Stream | Iterable<string | ArrayBufferView> | AsyncIterable<string | ArrayBufferView>'.
```



then you may need to update `@types/node`.

You can read the specifics about this change on GitHub .

### Creating Index Signatures from Non-Literal Method Names in Classes

TypeScript now has a more consistent behavior for methods in classes when they are declared with non-literal computed property names.
For example, in the following:



```id
tsdeclare const symbolMethodName: symbol;export class A {    [symbolMethodName]() { return 1 };}
```



Previously TypeScript just viewed the class in a way like the following:



```id
tsexport class A {}
```



In other words, from the type system’s perspective, `[symbolMethodName]` contributed nothing to the type of `A`

TypeScript 5.7 now views the method `[symbolMethodName]() {}` more meaningfully, and generates an index signature.
As a result, the code above is interpreted as something like the following code:



```id
tsexport class A {    [x: symbol]: () => number;}
```



This provides behavior that is consistent with properties and methods in object literals.

 Read up more on this change here .

### More Implicit `any` Errors on Functions Returning `null` and `undefined`

When a function expression is contextually typed by a signature returning a generic type, TypeScript now appropriately provides an implicit `any` error under `noImplicitAny`, but outside of `strictNullChecks`.



```id
tsdeclare var p: Promise<number>;const p2 = p.catch(() => null);//                 ~~~~~~~~~~// error TS7011: Function expression, which lacks return-type annotation, implicitly has an 'any' return type.
```

### TypeScript: Documentation - ASP.NET Core

**Source:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/asp-net-core.html#handbook-content

- TypeScript: Documentation - ASP.NET Core 

Was this page helpful?

 

# ASP.NET Core

 

## Install ASP.NET Core and TypeScript

First, install ASP.NET Core if you need it. This quick-start guide requires Visual Studio 2015 or 2017.

Next, if your version of Visual Studio does not already have the latest TypeScript, you can install it .

## Create a new project

 Choose File 

- Choose New Project (Ctrl + Shift + N)

- Search for .NET Core in the project search bar

- Select ASP.NET Core Web Application and press the Next button

 

- Name your project and solution. After select the Create button

 

- In the last window, select the Empty template and press the Create button

 

Run the application and make sure that it works.

 

### Set up the server

Open Dependencies > Manage NuGet Packages > Browse. Search and install `Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles` and `Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild`:

 

Open up your `Startup.cs` file and edit your `Configure` function to look like this:



```
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }

    app.UseDefaultFiles();
    app.UseStaticFiles();
}
```

 

You may need to restart VS for the red squiggly lines below `UseDefaultFiles` and `UseStaticFiles` to disappear.

## Add TypeScript

Next we will add a new folder and call it `scripts`.

 

 

## Add TypeScript code

Right click on `scripts` and click New Item . Then choose TypeScript File and name the file `app.ts`

 

### Add example code

Add the following code to the `app.ts` file.



```id
tsfunction sayHello() {  const compiler = (document.getElementById("compiler") as HTMLInputElement)    .value;  const framework = (document.getElementById("framework") as HTMLInputElement)    .value;  return `Hello from ${compiler} and ${framework}!`;}
```



## Set up the build

 Configure the TypeScript compiler 

First we need to tell TypeScript how to build. Right click on `scripts` and click New Item . Then choose TypeScript Configuration File and use the default name of `tsconfig.json`

 

Replace the contents of the `tsconfig.json` file with:



```
{  "compilerOptions": {    "noEmitOnError": true,    "noImplicitAny": true,    "sourceMap": true,    "target": "es6"  },  "files": ["./app.ts"],  "compileOnSave": true}
```



- `noEmitOnError` : Do not emit outputs if any errors were reported.

- `noImplicitAny` : Raise error on expressions and declarations with an implied `any` type.

- `sourceMap` : Generates corresponding `.map` file.

- `target` : Specify ECMAScript target version.

Note: `"ESNext"` targets latest supported

 `noImplicitAny` is good idea whenever you’re writing new code — you can make sure that you don’t write any untyped code by mistake. `"compileOnSave"` makes it easy to update your code in a running web app.

#### Set up NPM 

We need to setup NPM so that JavaScript packages can be downloaded. Right click on the project and select New Item . Then choose NPM Configuration File and use the default name of `package.json`.

 

Inside the `"devDependencies"` section of the `package.json` file, add gulp and del 



```
"devDependencies": {    "gulp": "4.0.2",    "del": "5.1.0"}
```



Visual Studio should start installing gulp and del as soon as you save the file. If not, right-click package.json and then Restore Packages.

After you should see an `npm` folder in your solution explorer

 

#### Set up gulp 

Right click on the project and click New Item . Then choose JavaScript File and use the name of `gulpfile.js`



```id
js/// <binding AfterBuild='default' Clean='clean' />/*This file is the main entry point for defining Gulp tasks and using Gulp plugins.Click here to learn more. http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518007*/var gulp = require("gulp");var del = require("del");var paths = {  scripts: ["scripts/**/*.js", "scripts/**/*.ts", "scripts/**/*.map"],};gulp.task("clean", function () {  return del(["wwwroot/scripts/**/*"]);});gulp.task("default", function (done) {    gulp.src(paths.scripts).pipe(gulp.dest("wwwroot/scripts"));    done();});
```



The first line tells Visual Studio to run the task ‘default’ after the build finishes. It will also run the ‘clean’ task when you ask Visual Studio to clean the build.

Now right-click on `gulpfile.js` and click Task Runner Explorer.

 

If ‘default’ and ‘clean’ tasks don’t show up, refresh the explorer:

 

## Write a HTML page

Right click on the `wwwroot` folder (if you don’t see the folder try building the project) and add a New Item named `index.html` inside. Use the following code for `index.html`



```
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>    <meta charset="utf-8" />    <script src="scripts/app.js"></script>    <title></title></head><body>    <div id="message"></div>    <div>        Compiler: <input id="compiler" value="TypeScript" onkeyup="document.getElementById('message').innerText = sayHello()" /><br />        Framework: <input id="framework" value="ASP.NET" onkeyup="document.getElementById('message').innerText = sayHello()" />    </div></body></html>
```



## Test

- Run the project

- As you type on the boxes you should see the message appear/change!

 

## Debug

- In Edge, press F12 and click the Debugger tab.

- Look in the first localhost folder, then scripts/app.ts

- Put a breakpoint on the line with return.

- Type in the boxes and confirm that the breakpoint hits in TypeScript code and that inspection works correctly.

 

Congrats you’ve built your own .NET Core project with a TypeScript frontend.

TypeScript: Documentation - TypeScript 5.6

# TypeScript 5.6

 

## Disallowed Nullish and Truthy Checks

Maybe you’ve written a regex and forgotten to call `.test(...)` on it:



```id
tsif (/0x[0-9a-f]/) {    // Oops! This block always runs.    // ...}
```



or maybe you’ve accidentally written `=>` (which creates an arrow function) instead of `>=` (the greater-than-or-equal-to operator):



```id
tsif (x => 0) {    // Oops! This block always runs.    // ...}
```



or maybe you’ve tried to use a default value with `??`, but mixed up the precedence of `??` and a comparison operator like ` many bugs could be caught from flagging down suspicious examples like above.
In TypeScript 5.6, the compiler now errors when it can syntactically determine a truthy or nullish check will always evaluate in a specific way.
So in the above examples, you’ll start to see errors:



```id
tsif (/0x[0-9a-f]/) {//  ~~~~~~~~~~~~// error: This kind of expression is always truthy.}if (x => 0) {//  ~~~~~~// error: This kind of expression is always truthy.}function isValid(value: string | number, options: any, strictness: "strict" | "loose") {    if (strictness === "loose") {        value = +value    }    return value < options.max ?? 100;    //     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    // error: Right operand of ?? is unreachable because the left operand is never nullish.}if (    isValid(primaryValue, "strict") || isValid(secondaryValue, "strict") ||    isValid(primaryValue, "loose" || isValid(secondaryValue, "loose"))) {    //                    ~~~~~~~    // error: This kind of expression is always truthy.}
```



Similar results can be achieved by enabling the ESLint `no-constant-binary-expression` rule, and you can see some of the results they achieved in their blog post ;
but the new checks TypeScript performs does not have perfect overlap with the ESLint rule, and we also believe there is a lot of value in having these checks built into TypeScript itself.

Note that certain expressions are still allowed, even if they are always truthy or nullish.
Specifically, `true`, `false`, `0`, and `1` are all still allowed despite always being truthy or falsy, since code like the following:



```id
tswhile (true) {    doStuff();    if (something()) {        break;    }    doOtherStuff();}
```



is still idiomatic and useful, and code like the following:



```id
tsif (true || inDebuggingOrDevelopmentEnvironment()) {    // ...}
```



is useful while iterating/debugging code.

If you’re curious about the implementation or the sorts of bugs it catches, take a look at the pull request that implemented this feature .

## Iterator Helper Methods

JavaScript has a notion of iterables (things which we can iterate over by calling a `[Symbol.iterator]()` and getting an iterator) and iterators (things which have a `next()` method which we can call to try to get the next value as we iterate).
By and large, you don’t typically have to think about these things when you toss them into a `for`/`of` loop, or `[...spread]` them into a new array.
But TypeScript does model these with the types `Iterable` and `Iterator` (and even `IterableIterator` which acts as both!), and these types describe the minimal set of members you need for constructs like `for`/`of` to work on them.

`Iterable`s (and `IterableIterator`s) are nice because they can be used in all sorts of places in JavaScript - but a lot of people found themselves missing methods on `Array`s like `map`, `filter`, and for some reason `reduce`.
That’s why a recent proposal was brought forward in ECMAScript to add many methods (and more) from `Array` onto most of the `IterableIterator`s that are produced in JavaScript.

For example, every generator now produces an object that also has a `map` method and a `take` method.



```id
tsfunction* positiveIntegers() {    let i = 1;    while (true) {        yield i;        i++;    }}const evenNumbers = positiveIntegers().map(x => x * 2);// Output://    2//    4//    6//    8//   10for (const value of evenNumbers.take(5)) {    console.log(value);}
```



The same is true for methods like `keys()`, `values()`, and `entries()` on `Map`s and `Set`s.



```id
tsfunction invertKeysAndValues<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>): Map<V, K> {    return new Map(        map.entries().map(([k, v]) => [v, k])    );}
```



You can also extend the new `Iterator` object:



```id
ts/** * Provides an endless stream of `0`s. */class Zeroes extends Iterator<number> {    next() {        return { value: 0, done: false } as const;    }}const zeroes = new Zeroes();// Transform into an endless stream of `1`s.const ones = zeroes.map(x => x + 1);
```



And you can adapt any existing `Iterable`s or `Iterator`s into this new type with `Iterator.from`:



```id
tsIterator.from(...).filter(someFunction);
```



Now, we have to talk about naming.

Earlier we mentioned that TypeScript has types for `Iterable` and `Iterator`;
however, like we mentioned, these act sort of like “protocols” to ensure certain operations work.
 That means that not every value that is declared `Iterable` or `Iterator` in TypeScript will have those methods we mentioned above. 

But there is still a new runtime value called `Iterator`.
You can reference `Iterator`, as well as `Iterator.prototype`, as actual values in JavaScript.
This is a bit awkward since TypeScript already defines its own thing called `Iterator` purely for type-checking.
So due to this unfortunate name clash, TypeScript needs to introduce a separate type to describe these native/built-in iterable iterators.

TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new type called `IteratorObject`.
It is defined as follows:



```id
tsinterface IteratorObject<T, TReturn = unknown, TNext = unknown> extends Iterator<T, TReturn, TNext> {    [Symbol.iterator](): IteratorObject<T, TReturn, TNext>;}
```



Lots of built-in collections and methods produce subtypes of `IteratorObject`s (like `ArrayIterator`, `SetIterator`, `MapIterator`, and more), and both the core JavaScript and DOM types in `lib.d.ts`, along with `@types/node`, have been updated to use this new type.

Similarly, there is a `AsyncIteratorObject` type for parity.
`AsyncIterator` does not yet exist as a runtime value in JavaScript that brings the same methods for `AsyncIterable`s, but it is an active proposal and this new type prepares for it.

We’d like to thank Kevin Gibbons who contributed the changes for these types , and who is one of the co-authors of the proposal .

## Strict Builtin Iterator Checks (and `--strictBuiltinIteratorReturn`)

When you call the `next()` method on an `Iterator `, it returns an object with a `value` and a `done` property.
This is modeled with the type `IteratorResult`.



```id
tstype IteratorResult<T, TReturn = any> = IteratorYieldResult<T> | IteratorReturnResult<TReturn>;interface IteratorYieldResult<TYield> {    done?: false;    value: TYield;}interface IteratorReturnResult<TReturn> {    done: true;    value: TReturn;}
```



The naming here is inspired by the way a generator function works.
Generator functions can `yield` values, and then `return` a final value - but the types between the two can be unrelated.



```id
tsfunction abc123() {    yield "a";    yield "b";    yield "c";    return 123;}const iter = abc123();iter.next(); // { value: "a", done: false }iter.next(); // { value: "b", done: false }iter.next(); // { value: "c", done: false }iter.next(); // { value: 123, done: true }
```



With the new `IteratorObject` type, we discovered some difficulties in allowing safe implementations of `IteratorObject`s.
At the same time, there’s been a long standing unsafety with `IteratorResult` in cases where `TReturn` was `any` (the default!).
For example, let’s say we have an `IteratorResult `.
If we end up reaching for the `value` of this type, we’ll end up with `string | any`, which is just `any`.



```id
tsfunction* uppercase(iter: Iterator<string, any>) {    while (true) {        const { value, done } = iter.next();        yield value.toUppercase(); // oops! forgot to check for `done` first and misspelled `toUpperCase`        if (done) {            return;        }    }}
```



It would be hard to fix this on every `Iterator` today without introducing a lot of breaks, but we can at least fix it with most `IteratorObject`s that get created.

TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new intrinsic type called `BuiltinIteratorReturn` and a new `--strict`-mode flag called `--strictBuiltinIteratorReturn`.
Whenever `IteratorObject`s are used in places like `lib.d.ts`, they are always written with `BuiltinIteratorReturn` type for `TReturn` (though you’ll see the more-specific `MapIterator`, `ArrayIterator`, `SetIterator` more often).



```id
tsinterface MapIterator<T> extends IteratorObject<T, BuiltinIteratorReturn, unknown> {    [Symbol.iterator](): MapIterator<T>;}// ...interface Map<K, V> {    // ...    /**     * Returns an iterable of key, value pairs for every entry in the map.     */    entries(): MapIterator<[K, V]>;    /**     * Returns an iterable of keys in the map     */    keys(): MapIterator<K>;    /**     * Returns an iterable of values in the map     */    values(): MapIterator<V>;}
```



By default, `BuiltinIteratorReturn` is `any`, but when `--strictBuiltinIteratorReturn` is enabled (possibly via `--strict`), it is `undefined`.
Under this new mode, if we use `BuiltinIteratorReturn`, our earlier example now correctly errors:



```id
tsfunction* uppercase(iter: Iterator<string, BuiltinIteratorReturn>) {    while (true) {        const { value, done } = iter.next();        yield value.toUppercase();        //    ~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~        // error! ┃      ┃        //        ┃      ┗━ Property 'toUppercase' does not exist on type 'string'. Did you mean 'toUpperCase'?        //        ┃        //        ┗━ 'value' is possibly 'undefined'.        if (done) {            return;        }    }}
```



You’ll typically see `BuiltinIteratorReturn` paired up with `IteratorObject` throughout `lib.d.ts`.
In general, we recommend being more explicit around the `TReturn` in your own code when possible.

For more information, you can read up on the feature here .

## Support for Arbitrary Module Identifiers

JavaScript allows modules to export bindings with invalid identifier names as string literals:



```id
tsconst banana = "🍌";export { banana as "🍌" };
```



Likewise, it allows modules to grab imports with these arbitrary names and bind them to valid identifiers:



```id
tsimport { "🍌" as banana } from "./foo"/** * om nom nom */function eat(food: string) {    console.log("Eating", food);};eat(banana);
```



This seems like a cute party trick (if you’re as fun as we are at parties), but it has its uses for interoperability with other languages (typically via JavaScript/WebAssembly boundaries), since other languages may have different rules for what constitutes a valid identifier.
It can also be useful for tools that generate code, like esbuild with its `inject` feature .

TypeScript 5.6 now allows you to use these arbitrary module identifiers in your code!
We’d like to thank Evan Wallace who contributed this change to TypeScript !

## The `--noUncheckedSideEffectImports` Option

In JavaScript it’s possible to `import` a module without actually importing any values from it.



```id
tsimport "some-module";
```



These imports are often called side effect imports because the only useful behavior they can provide is by executing some side effect (like registering a global variable, or adding a polyfill to a prototype).

In TypeScript, this syntax has had a pretty strange quirk: if the `import` could be resolved to a valid source file, then TypeScript would load and check the file.
On the other hand, if no source file could be found, TypeScript would silently ignore the `import`!

This is surprising behavior, but it partially stems from modeling patterns in the JavaScript ecosystem.
For example, this syntax has also been used with special loaders in bundlers to load CSS or other assets.
Your bundler might be configured in such a way where you can include specific `.css` files by writing something like the following:



```id
tsximport "./button-component.css";export function Button() {    // ...}
```



Still, this masks potential typos on side effect imports.
That’s why TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new compiler option called `--noUncheckedSideEffectImports`, to catch these cases.
When `--noUncheckedSideEffectImports` is enabled, TypeScript will now error if it can’t find a source file for a side effect import.



```id
tsimport "oops-this-module-does-not-exist";//     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// error: Cannot find module 'oops-this-module-does-not-exist' or its corresponding type declarations.
```



When enabling this option, some working code may now receive an error, like in the CSS example above.
To work around this, users who want to just write side effect `import`s for assets might be better served by writing what’s called an ambient module declaration with a wildcard specifier.
It would go in a global file and look something like the following:



```id
ts// ./src/globals.d.ts// Recognize all CSS files as module imports.declare module "*.css" {}
```



In fact, you might already have a file like this in your project!
For example, running something like `vite init` might create a similar `vite-env.d.ts`.

While this option is currently off by default, we encourage users to give it a try!

For more information, check out the implementation here .

## The `--noCheck` Option

TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new compiler option, `--noCheck`, which allows you to skip type checking for all input files.
This avoids unnecessary type-checking when performing any semantic analysis necessary for emitting output files.

One scenario for this is to separate JavaScript file generation from type-checking so that the two can be run as separate phases.
For example, you could run `tsc --noCheck` while iterating, and then `tsc --noEmit` for a thorough type check.
You could also run the two tasks in parallel, even in `--watch` mode, though note you’d probably want to specify a separate `--tsBuildInfoFile` path if you’re truly running them at the same time.

`--noCheck` is also useful for emitting declaration files in a similar fashion.
In a project where `--noCheck` is specified on a project that conforms to `--isolatedDeclarations`, TypeScript can quickly generate declaration files without a type-checking pass.
The generated declaration files will rely purely on quick syntactic transformations.

Note that in cases where `--noCheck` is specified, but a project does not use `--isolatedDeclarations`, TypeScript may still perform as much type-checking as necessary to generate `.d.ts` files.
In this sense, `--noCheck` is a bit of a misnomer; however, the process will be lazier than a full type-check, only calculating the types of unannotated declarations.
This should be much faster than a full type-check.

`noCheck` is also available via the TypeScript API as a standard option.
Internally, `transpileModule` and `transpileDeclaration` already used `noCheck` to speed things up (at least as of TypeScript 5.5).
Now any build tool should be able to leverage the flag, taking a variety of custom strategies to coordinate and speed up builds.

For more information, see the work done in TypeScript 5.5 to power up `noCheck` internally , along with the relevant work to make it publicly available on the command line and

## Allow `--build` with Intermediate Errors

TypeScript’s concept of project references allows you to organize your codebase into multiple projects and create dependencies between them.
Running the TypeScript compiler in `--build` mode (or `tsc -b` for short) is the built-in way of actually conducting that build across projects and figuring out which projects and files need to be compiled.

Previously, using `--build` mode would assume `--noEmitOnError` and immediately stop the build if any errors were encountered.
This meant that “downstream” projects could never be checked and built if any of their “upstream” dependencies had build errors.
In theory, this is a very cromulent approach - if a project has errors, it is not necessarily in a coherent state for its dependencies.

In reality, this sort of rigidity made things like upgrades a pain.
For example, if `projectB` depends on `projectA`, then people more familiar with `projectB` can’t proactively upgrade their code until their dependencies are upgraded.
They are blocked by work on upgrading `projectA` first.

As of TypeScript 5.6, `--build` mode will continue to build projects even if there are intermediate errors in dependencies.
In the face of intermediate errors, they will be reported consistently and output files will be generated on a best-effort basis;
however, the build will continue to completion on the specified project.

If you want to stop the build on the first project with errors, you can use a new flag called `--stopOnBuildErrors`.
This can be useful when running in a CI environment, or when iterating on a project that’s heavily depended upon by other projects.

Note that to accomplish this, TypeScript now always emits a `.tsbuildinfo` file for any project in a `--build` invocation (even if `--incremental`/`--composite` is not specified).
This is to keep track of the state of how `--build` was invoked and what work needs to be performed in the future.

You can read more about this change here on the implementation .

## Region-Prioritized Diagnostics in Editors

When TypeScript’s language service is asked for the diagnostics for a file (things like errors, suggestions, and deprecations), it would typically require checking the entire file .
Most of the time this is fine, but in extremely large files it can incur a delay.
That can be frustrating because fixing a typo should feel like a quick operation, but can take seconds in a big-enough file.

To address this, TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new feature called region-prioritized diagnostics or region-prioritized checking .
Instead of just requesting diagnostics for a set of files, editors can now also provide a relevant region of a given file - and the intent is that this will typically be the region of the file that is currently visible to a user.
The TypeScript language server can then choose to provide two sets of diagnostics: one for the region, and one for the file in its entirety.
This allows editing to feel way more responsive in large files so you’re not waiting as long for thoes red squiggles to disappear.

For some specific numbers, in our testing on TypeScript’s own `checker.ts` , a full semantic diagnostics response took 3330ms.
In contrast, the response for the first region-based diagnostics response took 143ms!
While the remaining whole-file response took about 3200ms, this can make a huge difference for quick edits.

This feature also includes quite a bit of work to also make diagnostics report more consistently throughout your experience.
Due the way our type-checker leverages caching to avoid work, subsequent checks between the same types could often have a different (typically shorter) error message.
Technically, lazy out-of-order checking could cause diagnostics to report differently between two locations in an editor - even before this feature - but we didn’t want to exacerbate the issue.
With recent work, we’ve ironed out many of these error inconsistencies.

Currently, this functionality is available in Visual Studio Code for TypeScript 5.6 and later.

For more detailed information, take a look at the implementation and write-up here .

## Granular Commit Characters

TypeScript’s language service now provides its own commit characters for each completion item.
Commit characters are specific characters that, when typed, will automatically commit the currently-suggested completion item.

What this means is that over time your editor will now more frequently commit to the currently-suggested completion item when you type certain characters.
For example, take the following code:



```id
tsdeclare let food: {    eat(): any;}let f = (foo/**/
```



If our cursor is at `/**/`, it’s unclear if the code we’re writing is going to be something like `let f = (food.eat())` or `let f = (foo, bar) => foo + bar`.
You could imagine that the editor might be able to auto-complete differently depending on which character we type out next.
For instance, if we type in the period/dot character (`.`), we probably want the editor to complete with the variable `food`;
but if we type the comma character (`,`), we might be writing out a parameter in an arrow function.

Unfortunately, previously TypeScript just signaled to editors that the current text might define a new parameter name so that no commit characters were safe.
So hitting a `.` wouldn’t do anything even if it was “obvious” that the editor should auto-complete with the word `food`.

TypeScript now explicitly lists which characters are safe to commit for each completion item.
While this won’t immediately change your day-to-day experience, editors that support these commit characters should see behavioral improvements over time.
To see those improvements right now, you can now use the TypeScript nightly extension with Visual Studio Code Insiders .
Hitting `.` in the code above correctly auto-completes with `food`.

For more information, see the pull request that added commit characters along with our adjustments to commit characters depending on context .

## Exclude Patterns for Auto-Imports

TypeScript’s language service now allows you to specify a list of regular expression patterns which will filter away auto-import suggestions from certain specifiers.
For example, if you want to exclude all “deep” imports from a package like `lodash`, you could configure the following preference in Visual Studio Code:



```id
json{    "typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes": [        "^lodash/.*$"    ]}
```



Or going the other way, you might want to disallow importing from the entry-point of a package:



```id
json{    "typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes": [        "^lodash$"    ]}
```



One could even avoid `node:` imports by using the following setting:



```id
json{    "typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes": [        "^node:"    ]}
```



Note that if you want to specify certain flags like `i` or `u`, you will need to surround your regular expression with slashes.
When providing surrounding slashes, you’ll need to escape other inner slashes.



```id
json{    "typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes": [        "^./lib/internal",        // no escaping needed        "/^.\\/lib\\/internal/",  // escaping needed - note the leading and trailing slashes        "/^.\\/lib\\/internal/i"  // escaping needed - we needed slashes to provide the 'i' regex flag    ]}
```



In Visual Studio Code, the same settings can be applied for JavaScript through 

```
javascript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes
```

.

For more information, see the implementation here .

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### `lib.d.ts`

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see linked issues related to DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates for this version of TypeScript .

### `.tsbuildinfo` is Always Written

To enable `--build` to continue building projects even if there are intermediate errors in dependencies, and to support `--noCheck` on the command line, TypeScript now always emits a `.tsbuildinfo` file for any project in a `--build` invocation.
This happens regardless of whether `--incremental` is actually on.
 See more information here .

### Respecting File Extensions and `package.json` from within `node_modules`

Before Node.js implemented support for ECMAScript modules in v12, there was never a good way for TypeScript to know whether `.d.ts` files it found in `node_modules` represented JavaScript files authored as CommonJS or ECMAScript modules.
When the vast majority of npm was CommonJS-only, this didn’t cause many problems - if in doubt, TypeScript could just assume that everything behaved like CommonJS.
Unfortunately, if that assumption was wrong it could allow unsafe imports:



```id
ts// node_modules/dep/index.d.tsexport declare function doSomething(): void;// index.ts// Okay if "dep" is a CommonJS module, but fails if// it's an ECMAScript module - even in bundlers!import dep from "dep";dep.doSomething();
```



In practice, this didn’t come up very often.
But in the years since Node.js started supporting ECMAScript modules, the share of ESM on npm has grown.
Fortunately, Node.js also introduced a mechanism that can help TypeScript determine if a file is an ECMAScript module or a CommonJS module: the `.mjs` and `.cjs` file extensions and the `package.json` `"type"` field.
TypeScript 4.7 added support for understanding these indicators, as well as authoring `.mts` and `.cts` files;
however, TypeScript would only read those indicators under `--module node16` and `--module nodenext`, so the unsafe import above was still a problem for anyone using `--module esnext` and `--moduleResolution bundler`, for example.

To solve this, TypeScript 5.6 collects module format information and uses it to resolve ambiguities like the one in the example above in all `module` modes (except `amd`, `umd`, and `system`).
Format-specific file extensions (`.mts` and `.cts`) are respected anywhere they’re found, and the `package.json` `"type"` field is consulted inside `node_modules` dependencies, regardless of the `module` setting.
Previously, it was technically possible to produce CommonJS output into a `.mjs` file or vice versa:



```id
ts// main.mtsexport default "oops";// $ tsc --module commonjs main.mts// main.mjsObject.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });exports.default = "oops";
```



Now, `.mts` files never emit CommonJS output, and `.cts` files never emit ESM output.

Note that much of this behavior was provided in pre-release versions of TypeScript 5.5 ( implementation details here ), but in 5.6 this behavior is only extended to files within `node_modules`.

More details are available on the change here .

### Correct `override` Checks on Computed Properties

Previously, computed properties marked with `override` did not correctly check for the existence of a base class member.
Similarly, if you used `noImplicitOverride`, you would not get an error if you forgot to add an `override` modifier to a computed property.

TypeScript 5.6 now correctly checks computed properties in both cases.



```id
tsconst foo = Symbol("foo");const bar = Symbol("bar");class Base {    [bar]() {}}class Derived extends Base {    override [foo]() {}//           ~~~~~// error: This member cannot have an 'override' modifier because it is not declared in the base class 'Base'.    [bar]() {}//  ~~~~~// error under noImplicitOverride: This member must have an 'override' modifier because it overrides a member in the base class 'Base'.}
```

### TypeScript: Documentation - Gulp

# Gulp

 

This quick start guide will teach you how to build TypeScript with gulp and then add Browserify , terser , or Watchify to the gulp pipeline.
This guide also shows how to add Babel functionality using Babelify .

We assume that you’re already using Node.js with npm .

## Minimal project

Let’s start out with a new directory.
We’ll name it `proj` for now, but you can change it to whatever you want.



```id
shellmkdir projcd proj
```



To start, we’re going to structure our project in the following way:



```
proj/   ├─ src/   └─ dist/
```



TypeScript files will start out in your `src` folder, run through the TypeScript compiler and end up in `dist`.

Let’s scaffold this out:



```id
shellmkdir srcmkdir dist
```



### Initialize the project

Now we’ll turn this folder into an npm package.



```id
shellnpm init
```



You’ll be given a series of prompts.
You can use the defaults except for your entry point.
For your entry point, use `./dist/main.js`.
You can always go back and change these in the `package.json` file that’s been generated for you.

### Install our dependencies

Now we can use `npm install` to install packages.
First install `gulp-cli` globally (if you use a Unix system, you may need to prefix the `npm install` commands in this guide with `sudo`).



```id
shellnpm install -g gulp-cli
```



Then install `typescript`, `gulp` and `gulp-typescript` in your project’s dev dependencies.
 Gulp-typescript is a gulp plugin for TypeScript.



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev typescript gulp@4.0.0 gulp-typescript
```



### Write a simple example

Let’s write a Hello World program.
In `src`, create the file `main.ts`:



```id
tsfunction hello(compiler: string) {  console.log(`Hello from ${compiler}`);}hello("TypeScript");
```



In the project root, `proj`, create the file `tsconfig.json`:



```
{  "files": ["src/main.ts"],  "compilerOptions": {    "noImplicitAny": true,    "target": "es5"  }}
```



### Create a `gulpfile.js`

In the project root, create the file `gulpfile.js`:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var ts = require("gulp-typescript");var tsProject = ts.createProject("tsconfig.json");gulp.task("default", function () {  return tsProject.src().pipe(tsProject()).js.pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});
```



### Test the resulting app



```id
shellgulpnode dist/main.js
```



The program should print “Hello from TypeScript!“.

## Add modules to the code

Before we get to Browserify, let’s build our code out and add modules to the mix.
This is the structure you’re more likely to use for a real app.

Create a file called `src/greet.ts`:



```id
tsexport function sayHello(name: string) {  return `Hello from ${name}`;}
```



Now change the code in `src/main.ts` to import `sayHello` from `greet.ts`:



```id
tsimport { sayHello } from "./greet";console.log(sayHello("TypeScript"));
```



Finally, add `src/greet.ts` to `tsconfig.json`:



```
{  "files": ["src/main.ts", "src/greet.ts"],  "compilerOptions": {    "noImplicitAny": true,    "target": "es5"  }}
```



Make sure that the modules work by running `gulp` and then testing in Node:



```id
shellgulpnode dist/main.js
```



Notice that even though we used ES2015 module syntax, TypeScript emitted CommonJS modules that Node uses.
We’ll stick with CommonJS for this tutorial, but you could set `module` in the options object to change this.

## Browserify

Now let’s move this project from Node to the browser.
To do this, we’d like to bundle all our modules into one JavaScript file.
Fortunately, that’s exactly what Browserify does.
Even better, it lets us use the CommonJS module system used by Node, which is the default TypeScript emit.
That means our TypeScript and Node setup will transfer to the browser basically unchanged.

First, install browserify, tsify , and vinyl-source-stream.
tsify is a Browserify plugin that, like gulp-typescript, gives access to the TypeScript compiler.
vinyl-source-stream lets us adapt the file output of Browserify back into a format that gulp understands called vinyl .



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev browserify tsify vinyl-source-stream
```



### Create a page

Create a file in `src` named `index.html`:



```id
html<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <meta charset="UTF-8" />    <title>Hello World!</title>  </head>  <body>    <p id="greeting">Loading ...</p>    <script src="bundle.js"></script>  </body></html>
```



Now change `main.ts` to update the page:



```id
tsimport { sayHello } from "./greet";function showHello(divName: string, name: string) {  const elt = document.getElementById(divName);  elt.innerText = sayHello(name);}showHello("greeting", "TypeScript");
```



Calling `showHello` calls `sayHello` to change the paragraph’s text.
Now change your gulpfile to the following:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var browserify = require("browserify");var source = require("vinyl-source-stream");var tsify = require("tsify");var paths = {  pages: ["src/*.html"],};gulp.task("copy-html", function () {  return gulp.src(paths.pages).pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});gulp.task(  "default",  gulp.series(gulp.parallel("copy-html"), function () {    return browserify({      basedir: ".",      debug: true,      entries: ["src/main.ts"],      cache: {},      packageCache: {},    })      .plugin(tsify)      .bundle()      .pipe(source("bundle.js"))      .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));  }));
```



This adds the `copy-html` task and adds it as a dependency of `default`.
That means any time `default` is run, `copy-html` has to run first.
We’ve also changed `default` to call Browserify with the tsify plugin instead of gulp-typescript.
Conveniently, they both allow us to pass the same options object to the TypeScript compiler.

After calling `bundle` we use `source` (our alias for vinyl-source-stream) to name our output bundle `bundle.js`.

Test the page by running gulp and then opening `dist/index.html` in a browser.
You should see “Hello from TypeScript” on the page.

Notice that we specified `debug: true` to Browserify.
This causes tsify to emit source maps inside the bundled JavaScript file.
Source maps let you debug your original TypeScript code in the browser instead of the bundled JavaScript.
You can test that source maps are working by opening the debugger for your browser and putting a breakpoint inside `main.ts`.
When you refresh the page the breakpoint should pause the page and let you debug `greet.ts`.

## Watchify, Babel, and Terser

Now that we are bundling our code with Browserify and tsify, we can add various features to our build with browserify plugins.

 

Watchify starts gulp and keeps it running, incrementally compiling whenever you save a file.
This lets you keep an edit-save-refresh cycle going in the browser.

- 

Babel is a hugely flexible compiler that converts ES2015 and beyond into ES5 and ES3.
This lets you add extensive and customized transformations that TypeScript doesn’t support.

- 

Terser compacts your code so that it takes less time to download.

### Watchify

We’ll start with Watchify to provide background compilation:



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev watchify fancy-log
```



Now change your gulpfile to the following:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var browserify = require("browserify");var source = require("vinyl-source-stream");var watchify = require("watchify");var tsify = require("tsify");var fancy_log = require("fancy-log");var paths = {  pages: ["src/*.html"],};var watchedBrowserify = watchify(  browserify({    basedir: ".",    debug: true,    entries: ["src/main.ts"],    cache: {},    packageCache: {},  }).plugin(tsify));gulp.task("copy-html", function () {  return gulp.src(paths.pages).pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});function bundle() {  return watchedBrowserify    .bundle()    .on("error", fancy_log)    .pipe(source("bundle.js"))    .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));}gulp.task("default", gulp.series(gulp.parallel("copy-html"), bundle));watchedBrowserify.on("update", bundle);watchedBrowserify.on("log", fancy_log);
```



There are basically three changes here, but they require you to refactor your code a bit.

- We wrapped our `browserify` instance in a call to `watchify`, and then held on to the result.

- We called `watchedBrowserify.on('update', bundle);` so that Browserify will run the `bundle` function every time one of your TypeScript files changes.

- We called `watchedBrowserify.on('log', fancy_log);` to log to the console.

Together (1) and (2) mean that we have to move our call to `browserify` out of the `default` task.
And we have to give the function for `default` a name since both Watchify and Gulp need to call it.
Adding logging with (3) is optional but very useful for debugging your setup.

Now when you run Gulp, it should start and stay running.
Try changing the code for `showHello` in `main.ts` and saving it.
You should see output that looks like this:



```id
shellproj$ gulp[10:34:20] Using gulpfile ~/src/proj/gulpfile.js[10:34:20] Starting 'copy-html'...[10:34:20] Finished 'copy-html' after 26 ms[10:34:20] Starting 'default'...[10:34:21] 2824 bytes written (0.13 seconds)[10:34:21] Finished 'default' after 1.36 s[10:35:22] 2261 bytes written (0.02 seconds)[10:35:24] 2808 bytes written (0.05 seconds)
```



### Terser

First install Terser.
Since the point of Terser is to mangle your code, we also need to install vinyl-buffer and gulp-sourcemaps to keep sourcemaps working.



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev gulp-terser vinyl-buffer gulp-sourcemaps
```



Now change your gulpfile to the following:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var browserify = require("browserify");var source = require("vinyl-source-stream");var terser = require("gulp-terser");var tsify = require("tsify");var sourcemaps = require("gulp-sourcemaps");var buffer = require("vinyl-buffer");var paths = {  pages: ["src/*.html"],};gulp.task("copy-html", function () {  return gulp.src(paths.pages).pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});gulp.task(  "default",  gulp.series(gulp.parallel("copy-html"), function () {    return browserify({      basedir: ".",      debug: true,      entries: ["src/main.ts"],      cache: {},      packageCache: {},    })      .plugin(tsify)      .bundle()      .pipe(source("bundle.js"))      .pipe(buffer())      .pipe(sourcemaps.init({ loadMaps: true }))      .pipe(terser())      .pipe(sourcemaps.write("./"))      .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));  }));
```



Notice that `terser` itself has just one call — the calls to `buffer` and `sourcemaps` exist to make sure sourcemaps keep working.
These calls give us a separate sourcemap file instead of using inline sourcemaps like before.
Now you can run Gulp and check that `bundle.js` does get minified into an unreadable mess:



```id
shellgulpcat dist/bundle.js
```



### Babel

First install Babelify and the Babel preset for ES2015.
Like Terser, Babelify mangles code, so we’ll need vinyl-buffer and gulp-sourcemaps.
By default Babelify will only process files with extensions of `.js`, `.es`, `.es6` and `.jsx` so we need to add the `.ts` extension as an option to Babelify.



```id
shellnpm install --save-dev babelify@8 babel-core babel-preset-es2015 vinyl-buffer gulp-sourcemaps
```



Now change your gulpfile to the following:



```id
jsvar gulp = require("gulp");var browserify = require("browserify");var source = require("vinyl-source-stream");var tsify = require("tsify");var sourcemaps = require("gulp-sourcemaps");var buffer = require("vinyl-buffer");var paths = {  pages: ["src/*.html"],};gulp.task("copy-html", function () {  return gulp.src(paths.pages).pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));});gulp.task(  "default",  gulp.series(gulp.parallel("copy-html"), function () {    return browserify({      basedir: ".",      debug: true,      entries: ["src/main.ts"],      cache: {},      packageCache: {},    })      .plugin(tsify)      .transform("babelify", {        presets: ["es2015"],        extensions: [".ts"],      })      .bundle()      .pipe(source("bundle.js"))      .pipe(buffer())      .pipe(sourcemaps.init({ loadMaps: true }))      .pipe(sourcemaps.write("./"))      .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));  }));
```



We also need to have TypeScript target ES2015.
Babel will then produce ES5 from the ES2015 code that TypeScript emits.
Let’s modify `tsconfig.json`:



```
{  "files": ["src/main.ts"],  "compilerOptions": {    "noImplicitAny": true,    "target": "es2015"  }}
```



Babel’s ES5 output should be very similar to TypeScript’s output for such a simple script.

# TypeScript 5.5

 

## Inferred Type Predicates

 This section was written by Dan Vanderkam , who implemented this feature in TypeScript 5.5 . Thanks Dan! 

TypeScript’s control flow analysis does a great job of tracking how the type of a variable changes as it moves through your code:



```id
tsxinterface Bird {    commonName: string;    scientificName: string;    sing(): void;}// Maps country names -> national bird.// Not all nations have official birds (looking at you, Canada!)declare const nationalBirds: Map<string, Bird>;function makeNationalBirdCall(country: string) {  const bird = nationalBirds.get(country);  // bird has a declared type of Bird | undefined  if (bird) {    bird.sing();  // bird has type Bird inside the if statement  } else {    // bird has type undefined here.  }}
```



By making you handle the `undefined` case, TypeScript pushes you to write more robust code.

In the past, this sort of type refinement was more difficult to apply to arrays. This would have been an error in all previous versions of TypeScript:



```id
tsxfunction makeBirdCalls(countries: string[]) {  // birds: (Bird | undefined)[]  const birds = countries    .map(country => nationalBirds.get(country))    .filter(bird => bird !== undefined);  for (const bird of birds) {    bird.sing();  // error: 'bird' is possibly 'undefined'.  }}
```



This code is perfectly fine: we’ve filtered all the `undefined` values out of the list.
But TypeScript hasn’t been able to follow along.

With TypeScript 5.5, the type checker is fine with this code:



```id
tsxfunction makeBirdCalls(countries: string[]) {  // birds: Bird[]  const birds = countries    .map(country => nationalBirds.get(country))    .filter(bird => bird !== undefined);  for (const bird of birds) {    bird.sing();  // ok!  }}
```



Note the more precise type for `birds`.

This works because TypeScript now infers a type predicate for the `filter` function.
You can see what’s going on more clearly by pulling it out into a standalone function:



```id
tsx// function isBirdReal(bird: Bird | undefined): bird is Birdfunction isBirdReal(bird: Bird | undefined) {  return bird !== undefined;}
```



`bird is Bird` is the type predicate.
It means that, if the function returns `true`, then it’s a `Bird` (if the function returns `false` then it’s `undefined`).
The type declarations for `Array.prototype.filter` know about type predicates, so the net result is that you get a more precise type and the code passes the type checker.

TypeScript will infer that a function returns a type predicate if these conditions hold:

 The function does not have an explicit return type or type predicate annotation.

- The function has a single `return` statement and no implicit returns.

- The function does not mutate its parameter.

- The function returns a `boolean` expression that’s tied to a refinement on the parameter.

Generally this works how you’d expect.
Here’s a few more examples of inferred type predicates:



```id
tsx// const isNumber: (x: unknown) => x is numberconst isNumber = (x: unknown) => typeof x === 'number';// const isNonNullish: <T>(x: T) => x is NonNullable<T>const isNonNullish = <T,>(x: T) => x != null;
```



Previously, TypeScript would have just inferred that these functions return `boolean`.
It now infers signatures with type predicates like `x is number` or `x is NonNullable `.

Type predicates have “if and only if” semantics.
If a function returns `x is T`, then it means that:

- If the function returns `true` then `x` has the type `T`.

- If the function returns `false` then `x` does not have type `T`.

If you’re expecting a type predicate to be inferred but it’s not, then you may be running afoul of the second rule. This often comes up with “truthiness” checks:



```id
tsxfunction getClassroomAverage(students: string[], allScores: Map<string, number>) {  const studentScores = students    .map(student => allScores.get(student))    .filter(score => !!score);  return studentScores.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / studentScores.length;  //     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  // error: Object is possibly 'undefined'.}
```



TypeScript did not infer a type predicate for `score => !!score`, and rightly so: if this returns `true` then `score` is a `number`.
But if it returns `false`, then `score` could be either `undefined` or a `number` (specifically, `0`).
This is a real bug: if any student got a zero on the test, then filtering out their score will skew the average upwards.
Fewer will be above average and more will be sad!

As with the first example, it’s better to explicitly filter out `undefined` values:



```id
tsxfunction getClassroomAverage(students: string[], allScores: Map<string, number>) {  const studentScores = students    .map(student => allScores.get(student))    .filter(score => score !== undefined);  return studentScores.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / studentScores.length;  // ok!}
```



A truthiness check will infer a type predicate for object types, where there’s no ambiguity.
Remember that functions must return a `boolean` to be a candidate for an inferred type predicate: `x => !!x` might infer a type predicate, but `x => x` definitely won’t.

Explicit type predicates continue to work exactly as before.
TypeScript will not check whether it would infer the same type predicate.
Explicit type predicates (“is”) are no safer than a type assertion (“as”).

It’s possible that this feature will break existing code if TypeScript now infers a more precise type than you want. For example:



```id
tsx// Previously, nums: (number | null)[]// Now, nums: number[]const nums = [1, 2, 3, null, 5].filter(x => x !== null);nums.push(null);  // ok in TS 5.4, error in TS 5.5
```



The fix is to tell TypeScript the type that you want using an explicit type annotation:



```id
tsxconst nums: (number | null)[] = [1, 2, 3, null, 5].filter(x => x !== null);nums.push(null);  // ok in all versions
```



For more information, check out the implementing pull request and Dan’s blog post about implementing this feature .

## Control Flow Narrowing for Constant Indexed Accesses

TypeScript is now able to narrow expressions of the form `obj[key]` when both `obj` and `key` are effectively constant.



```id
tsfunction f1(obj: Record<string, unknown>, key: string) {    if (typeof obj[key] === "string") {        // Now okay, previously was error        obj[key].toUpperCase();    }}
```



In the above, neither `obj` nor `key` are ever mutated, so TypeScript can narrow the type of `obj[key]` to `string` after the `typeof` check.
For more information, see the implementing pull request here .

## The JSDoc `@import` Tag

Today, if you want to import something only for type-checking in a JavaScript file, it is cumbersome.
JavaScript developers can’t simply import a type named `SomeType` if it’s not there at runtime.



```id
js// ./some-module.d.tsexport interface SomeType {    // ...}// ./index.jsimport { SomeType } from "./some-module"; // ❌ runtime error!/** * @param {SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



`SomeType` won’t exist at runtime, so the import will fail.
Developers can instead use a namespace import instead.



```id
jsimport * as someModule from "./some-module";/** * @param {someModule.SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



But `./some-module` is still imported at runtime - which might also not be desirable.

To avoid this, developers typically had to use `import(...)` types in JSDoc comments.



```id
js/** * @param {import("./some-module").SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



If you wanted to reuse the same type in multiple places, you could use a `typedef` to avoid repeating the import.



```id
js/** * @typedef {import("./some-module").SomeType} SomeType *//** * @param {SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



This helps with local uses of `SomeType`, but it gets repetitive for many imports and can be a bit verbose.

That’s why TypeScript now supports a new `@import` comment tag that has the same syntax as ECMAScript imports.



```id
js/** @import { SomeType } from "some-module" *//** * @param {SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



Here, we used named imports.
We could also have written our import as a namespace import.



```id
js/** @import * as someModule from "some-module" *//** * @param {someModule.SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



Because these are just JSDoc comments, they don’t affect runtime behavior at all.

We would like to extend a big thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk who contributed this change !

## Regular Expression Syntax Checking

Until now, TypeScript has typically skipped over most regular expressions in code.
This is because regular expressions technically have an extensible grammar and TypeScript never made any effort to compile regular expressions to earlier versions of JavaScript.
Still, this meant that lots of common problems would go undiscovered in regular expressions, and they would either turn into errors at runtime, or silently fail.

But TypeScript now does basic syntax checking on regular expressions!



```id
tslet myRegex = /@robot(\s+(please|immediately)))? do some task/;//                                            ~// error!// Unexpected ')'. Did you mean to escape it with backslash?
```



This is a simple example, but this checking can catch a lot of common mistakes.
In fact, TypeScript’s checking goes slightly beyond syntactic checks.
For instance, TypeScript can now catch issues around backreferences that don’t exist.



```id
tslet myRegex = /@typedef \{import\((.+)\)\.([a-zA-Z_]+)\} \3/u;//                                                        ~// error!// This backreference refers to a group that does not exist.// There are only 2 capturing groups in this regular expression.
```



The same applies to named capturing groups.



```id
tslet myRegex = /@typedef \{import\((?<importPath>.+)\)\.(?<importedEntity>[a-zA-Z_]+)\} \k<namedImport>/;//                                                                                        ~~~~~~~~~~~// error!// There is no capturing group named 'namedImport' in this regular expression.
```



TypeScript’s checking is now also aware of when certain RegExp features are used when newer than your target version of ECMAScript.
For example, if we use named capturing groups like the above in an ES5 target, we’ll get an error.



```id
tslet myRegex = /@typedef \{import\((?<importPath>.+)\)\.(?<importedEntity>[a-zA-Z_]+)\} \k<importedEntity>/;//                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// error!// Named capturing groups are only available when targeting 'ES2018' or later.
```



The same is true for certain regular expression flags as well.

Note that TypeScript’s regular expression support is limited to regular expression literals .
If you try calling `new RegExp` with a string literal, TypeScript will not check the provided string.

We would like to thank GitHub user graphemecluster who iterated a ton with us to get this feature into TypeScript .

## Support for New ECMAScript `Set` Methods

TypeScript 5.5 declares new proposed methods for the ECMAScript `Set` type .

Some of these methods, like `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, and `symmetricDifference`, take another `Set` and return a new `Set` as the result.
The other methods, `isSubsetOf`, `isSupersetOf`, and `isDisjointFrom`, take another `Set` and return a `boolean`.
None of these methods mutate the original `Set`s.

Here’s a quick example of how you might use these methods and how they behave:



```id
tslet fruits = new Set(["apples", "bananas", "pears", "oranges"]);let applesAndBananas = new Set(["apples", "bananas"]);let applesAndOranges = new Set(["apples", "oranges"]);let oranges = new Set(["oranges"]);let emptySet = new Set();////// union////// Set(4) {'apples', 'bananas', 'pears', 'oranges'}console.log(fruits.union(oranges));// Set(3) {'apples', 'bananas', 'oranges'}console.log(applesAndBananas.union(oranges));////// intersection////// Set(2) {'apples', 'bananas'}console.log(fruits.intersection(applesAndBananas));// Set(0) {}console.log(applesAndBananas.intersection(oranges));// Set(1) {'apples'}console.log(applesAndBananas.intersection(applesAndOranges));////// difference////// Set(3) {'apples', 'bananas', 'pears'}console.log(fruits.difference(oranges));// Set(2) {'pears', 'oranges'}console.log(fruits.difference(applesAndBananas));// Set(1) {'bananas'}console.log(applesAndBananas.difference(applesAndOranges));////// symmetricDifference////// Set(2) {'bananas', 'oranges'}console.log(applesAndBananas.symmetricDifference(applesAndOranges)); // no apples////// isDisjointFrom////// trueconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isDisjointFrom(oranges));// falseconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isDisjointFrom(applesAndOranges));// trueconsole.log(fruits.isDisjointFrom(emptySet));// trueconsole.log(emptySet.isDisjointFrom(emptySet));////// isSubsetOf////// trueconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isSubsetOf(fruits));// falseconsole.log(fruits.isSubsetOf(applesAndBananas));// falseconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isSubsetOf(oranges));// trueconsole.log(fruits.isSubsetOf(fruits));// trueconsole.log(emptySet.isSubsetOf(fruits));////// isSupersetOf////// trueconsole.log(fruits.isSupersetOf(applesAndBananas));// falseconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isSupersetOf(fruits));// falseconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isSupersetOf(oranges));// trueconsole.log(fruits.isSupersetOf(fruits));// falseconsole.log(emptySet.isSupersetOf(fruits));
```



We’d like to thank Kevin Gibbons who not only co-championed the feature in ECMAScript, but also provided the declarations for `Set`, `ReadonlySet`, and `ReadonlySetLike` in TypeScript !

## Isolated Declarations

 This section was co-authored by Rob Palmer who supported the design of isolated declarations. 

Declaration files (a.k.a. `.d.ts` files) describe the shape of existing libraries and modules to TypeScript.
This lightweight description includes the library’s type signatures and excludes implementation details such as the function bodies.
They are published so that TypeScript can efficiently check your usage of a library without needing to analyse the library itself.
Whilst it is possible to handwrite declaration files, if you are authoring typed code, it’s much safer and simpler to let TypeScript generate them automatically from source files using `--declaration`.

The TypeScript compiler and its APIs have always had the job of generating declaration files;
however, there are some use-cases where you might want to use other tools, or where the traditional build process doesn’t scale.

### Use-case: Faster Declaration Emit Tools

Imagine if you wanted to create a faster tool to generate declaration files, perhaps as part of a publishing service or a new bundler.
Whilst there is a thriving ecosystem of blazing fast tools that can turn TypeScript into JavaScript, the same is not true for turning TypeScript into declaration files.
The reason is that TypeScript’s inference allows us to write code without explicitly declaring types, meaning declaration emit can be complex.

Let’s consider a simple example of a function that adds two imported variables.



```id
ts// util.tsexport let one = "1";export let two = "2";// add.tsimport { one, two } from "./util";export function add() { return one + two; }
```



Even if the only thing we want to do is generate `add.d.ts`, TypeScript needs to crawl into another imported file (`util.ts`), infer that the type of `one` and `two` are strings, and then calculate that the `+` operator on two strings will lead to a `string` return type.



```id
ts// add.d.tsexport declare function add(): string;
```



While this inference is important for the developer experience, it means that tools that want to generate declaration files would need to replicate parts of the type-checker including inference and the ability to resolve module specifiers to follow the imports.

### Use-case: Parallel Declaration Emit and Parallel Checking

Imagine if you had a monorepo containing many projects and a multi-core CPU that just wished it could help you check your code faster.
Wouldn’t it be great if we could check all those projects at the same time by running each project on a different core?

Unfortunately we don’t have the freedom to do all the work in parallel.
The reason is that we have to build those projects in dependency order, because each project is checking against the declaration files of their dependencies.
So we must build the dependency first to generate the declaration files.
TypeScript’s project references feature works the same way, building the set of projects in “topological” dependency order.

As an example, if we have two projects called `backend` and `frontend`, and they both depend on a project called `core`, TypeScript can’t start type-checking either `frontend` or `backend` until `core` has been built and its declaration files have been generated.

 

In the above graph, you can see that we have a bottleneck.
Whilst we can build `frontend` and `backend` in parallel, we need to first wait for `core` to finish building before either can start.

How could we improve upon this?
Well, if a fast tool could generate all those declaration files for `core` in parallel , TypeScript then could immediately follow that by type-checking `core`, `frontend`, and `backend` also in parallel .

### Solution: Explicit Types!

The common requirement in both use-cases is that we need a cross-file type-checker to generate declaration files.
Which is a lot to ask from the tooling community.

As a more complex example, if we want a declaration file for the following code…



```id
tsimport { add } from "./add";const x = add();export function foo() {    return x;}
```



…we would need to generate a signature for `foo`.
Well that requires looking at the implementation of `foo`.
`foo` just returns `x`, so getting the type of `x` requires looking at the implementation of `add`.
But that might require looking at the implementation of `add`’s dependencies, and so on.
What we’re seeing here is that generating declaration files requires a whole lot of logic to figure out the types of different places that might not even be local to the current file.

Still, for developers looking for fast iteration time and fully parallel builds, there is another way of thinking about this problem.
A declaration file only requires the types of the public API of a module - in other words, the types of the things that are exported.
If, controversially, developers are willing to explicitly write out the types of the things they export, tools could generate declaration files without needing to look at the implementation of the module - and without reimplementing a full type-checker.

This is where the new `--isolatedDeclarations` option comes in.
`--isolatedDeclarations` reports errors when a module can’t be reliably transformed without a type-checker.
More plainly, it makes TypeScript report errors if you have a file that isn’t sufficiently annotated on its exports.

That means in the above example, we would see an error like the following:



```id
tsexport function foo() {//              ~~~// error! Function must have an explicit// return type annotation with --isolatedDeclarations.    return x;}
```



### Why are errors desirable?

Because it means that TypeScript can

- Tell us up-front whether other tools will have issues with generating declaration files

- Provide a quick fix to help add these missing annotations.

This mode doesn’t require annotations everywhere though.
For locals, these can be ignored, since they don’t affect the public API.
For example, the following code would not produce an error:



```id
tsimport { add } from "./add";const x = add("1", "2"); // no error on 'x', it's not exported.export function foo(): string {    return x;}
```



There are also certain expressions where the type is “trivial” to calculate.



```id
ts// No error on 'x'.// It's trivial to calculate the type is 'number'export let x = 10;// No error on 'y'.// We can get the type from the return expression.export function y() {    return 20;}// No error on 'z'.// The type assertion makes it clear what the type is.export function z() {    return Math.max(x, y()) as number;}
```



### Using `isolatedDeclarations`

`isolatedDeclarations` requires that either the `declaration` or `composite` flags are also set.

Note that `isolatedDeclarations` does not change how TypeScript performs emit - just how it reports errors.
Importantly, and similar to `isolatedModules`, enabling the feature in TypeScript won’t immediately bring about the potential benefits discussed here.
So please be patient and look forward to future developments in this space.
Keeping tool authors in mind, we should also recognize that today, not all of TypeScript’s declaration emit can be easily replicated by other tools wanting to use it as a guide.
That’s something we’re actively working on improving.

On top of this, isolated declarations are still a new feature, and we’re actively working on improving the experience.
Some scenarios, like using computed property declarations in classes and object literals, are not yet supported under `isolatedDeclarations`.
Keep an eye on this space, and feel free to provide us with feedback.

We also feel it is worth calling out that `isolatedDeclarations` should be adopted on a case-by-case basis.
There are some developer ergonomics that are lost when using `isolatedDeclarations`, and thus it may not be the right choice if your setup is not leveraging the two scenarios mentioned earlier.
For others, the work on `isolatedDeclarations` has already uncovered many optimizations and opportunities to unlock different parallel build strategies.
In the meantime, if you’re willing to make the trade-offs, we believe `isolatedDeclarations` can be a powerful tool to speed up your build process as external tooling becomes more widely available.

For more information, read up on the Isolated Declarations: State of the Feature discussion on the TypeScript issue tracker.

### Credit

Work on `isolatedDeclarations` has been a long-time collaborative effort between the TypeScript team and the infrastructure and tooling teams within Bloomberg and Google.
Individuals like Hana Joo from Google who implemented the quick fix for isolated declaration errors (more on that soon), as well as Ashley Claymore, Jan Kühle, Lisa Velden, Rob Palmer, and Thomas Chetwin have been involved in discussion, specification, and implementation for many months.
But we feel it is specifically worth calling out the tremendous amount of work provided by Titian Cernicova-Dragomir from Bloomberg.
Titian has been instrumental in driving the implementation of `isolatedDeclarations` and has been a contributor to the TypeScript project for years prior.

While the feature involved many changes, you can see the core work for Isolated Declarations here .

## The `${configDir}` Template Variable for Configuration Files

It’s common in many codebases to reuse a shared `tsconfig.json` file that acts as a “base” for other configuration files.
This is done by using the `extends` field in a `tsconfig.json` file.



```id
json{    "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "./dist"    }}
```



One of the issues with this is that all paths in the `tsconfig.json` file are relative to the location of the file itself.
This means that if you have a shared `tsconfig.base.json` file that is used by multiple projects, relative paths often won’t be useful in the derived projects.
For example, imagine the following `tsconfig.base.json`:



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "typeRoots": [            "./node_modules/@types",            "./custom-types"        ],        "outDir": "dist"    }}
```



If author’s intent was that every `tsconfig.json` that extends this file should

- output to a `dist` directory relative to the derived `tsconfig.json` , and

- have a `custom-types` directory relative to the derived `tsconfig.json`,

then this would not work.
The `typeRoots` paths would be relative to the location of the shared `tsconfig.base.json` file, not the project that extends it.
Each project that extends this shared file would need to declare its own `outDir` and `typeRoots` with identical contents.
This could be frustrating and hard to keep in sync between projects, and while the example above is using `typeRoots`, this is a common problem for `paths` and other options.

To solve this, TypeScript 5.5 introduces a new template variable `${configDir}`.
When `${configDir}` is written in certain path fields of a `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` files, this variable is substituted with the containing directory of the configuration file in a given compilation.
This means that the above `tsconfig.base.json` could be rewritten as:



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "typeRoots": [            "${configDir}/node_modules/@types",            "${configDir}/custom-types"        ],        "outDir": "${configDir}/dist"    }}
```



Now, when a project extends this file, the paths will be relative to the derived `tsconfig.json`, not the shared `tsconfig.base.json` file.
This makes it easier to share configuration files across projects and ensures that the configuration files are more portable.

If you intend to make a `tsconfig.json` file extendable, consider if a `./` should instead be written with `${configDir}`.

For more information, see the proposal issue and the implementing pull request .

## Consulting `package.json` Dependencies for Declaration File Generation

Previously, TypeScript would often issue an error message like



```
The inferred type of "X" cannot be named without a reference to "Y". This is likely not portable. A type annotation is necessary.
```



This was often due to TypeScript’s declaration file generation finding itself in the contents of files that were never explicitly imported in a program.
Generating an import to such a file could be risky if the path ended up being relative.
Still, for codebases with explicit dependencies in the `dependencies` (or `peerDependencies` and `optionalDependencies`) of a `package.json`, generating such an import should be safe under certain resolution modes.
So in TypeScript 5.5, we’re more lenient when that’s the case, and many occurrences of this error should disappear.

 See this pull request for more details on the change.

## Editor and Watch-Mode Reliability Improvements

TypeScript has either added some new functionality or fixed existing logic that makes `--watch` mode and TypeScript’s editor integration feel more reliable.
That should hopefully translate to fewer TSServer/editor restarts.

### Correctly Refresh Editor Errors in Configuration Files

TypeScript can generate errors for `tsconfig.json` files;
however, those errors are actually generated from loading a project, and editors typically don’t directly request those errors for `tsconfig.json` files.
While this sounds like a technical detail, it means that when all errors issued in a `tsconfig.json` are fixed, TypeScript doesn’t issue a new fresh empty set of errors, and users are left with stale errors unless they reload their editor.

TypeScript 5.5 now intentionally issues an event to clear these out.
 See more here .

### Better Handling for Deletes Followed by Immediate Writes

Instead of overwriting files, some tools will opt to delete them and then create new files from scratch.
This is the case when running `npm ci`, for instance.

While this can be efficient for those tools, it can be problematic for TypeScript’s editor scenarios where deleting a watched might dispose of it and all of its transitive dependencies.
Deleting and creating a file in quick succession could lead to TypeScript tearing down an entire project and then rebuilding it from scratch.

TypeScript 5.5 now has a more nuanced approach by keeping parts of a deleted project around until it picks up on a new creation event.
This should make operations like `npm ci` work a lot better with TypeScript.
See more information on the approach here .

### Symlinks are Tracked in Failed Resolutions

When TypeScript fails to resolve a module, it will still need to watch for any failed lookup paths in case the module is added later.
Previously this was not done for symlinked directories, which could cause reliability issues in monorepo-like scenarios when a build occurred in one project but was not witnessed in the other.
This should be fixed in TypeScript 5.5, and means you won’t need to restart your editor as often.

 See more information here .

### Project References Contribute to Auto-Imports

Auto-imports no longer requires at least one explicit import to dependent projects in a project reference setup.
Instead, auto-import completions should just work across anything you’ve listed in the `references` field of your `tsconfig.json`.

 See more on the implementing pull request .

## Performance and Size Optimizations

### Monomorphized Objects in Language Service and Public API

In TypeScript 5.0, we ensured that our `Node` and `Symbol` objects had a consistent set of properties with a consistent initialization order.
Doing so helps reduce polymorphism in different operations, which allows runtimes to fetch properties more quickly.

By making this change, we witnessed impressive speed wins in the compiler;
however, most of these changes were performed on internal allocators for our data structures.
The language service, along with TypeScript’s public API, uses a different set of allocators for certain objects.
This allowed the TypeScript compiler to be a bit leaner, as data used only for the language service would never be used in the compiler.

In TypeScript 5.5, the same monomorphization work has been done for the language service and public API.
What this means is that your editor experience, and any build tools that use the TypeScript API, will get a decent amount faster.
In fact, in our benchmarks, we’ve seen a 5-8% speedup in build times when using the public TypeScript API’s allocators, and language service operations getting 10-20% faster .
While this does imply an increase in memory, we believe that tradeoff is worth it and hope to find ways to reduce that memory overhead.
Things should feel a lot snappier now.

For more information, see the change here .

### Monomorphized Control Flow Nodes

In TypeScript 5.5, nodes of the control flow graph have been monomorphized so that they always hold a consistent shape.
By doing so, check times will often be reduced by about 1%.

 See this change here .

### Optimizations on our Control Flow Graph

In many cases, control flow analysis will traverse nodes that don’t provide any new information.
We observed that in the absence of any early termination or effects in the antecedents (or “dominators”) of certain nodes meant that those nodes could always be skipped over.
As such, TypeScript now constructs its control flow graphs to take advantage of this by linking to an earlier node that does provide interesting information for control flow analysis.
This yields a flatter control flow graph, which can be more efficient to traverse.
This optimization has yielded modest gains, but with up to 2% reductions in build time on certain codebases.

You can read more here .

### Skipped Checking in `transpileModule` and `transpileDeclaration`

TypeScript’s `transpileModule` API can be used for compiling a single TypeScript file’s contents into JavaScript.
Similarly, the `transpileDeclaration` API (see below) can be used to generate a declaration file for a single TypeScript file.
One of the issues with these APIs is that TypeScript internally would perform a full type-checking pass over the entire contents of the file before emitting the output.
This was necessary to collect certain information which would later be used for the emit phase.

In TypeScript 5.5, we’ve found a way to avoid performing a full check, only lazily collecting this information as necessary, and `transpileModule` and `transpileDeclaration` both enable this functionality by default.
As a result, tools that integrate with these APIs, like ts-loader with `transpileOnly` and ts-jest , should see a noticeable speedup.
In our testing, we generally witness around a 2x speed-up in build time using `transpileModule` .

### TypeScript Package Size Reduction

Further leveraging our transition to modules in 5.0 , we’ve significantly reduced TypeScript’s overall package size by making `tsserver.js` and `typingsInstaller.js` import from a common API library instead of having each of them produce standalone bundles .

This reduces TypeScript’s size on disk from 30.2 MB to 20.4 MB, and reduces its packed size from 5.5 MB to 3.7 MB!

### Node Reuse in Declaration Emit

As part of the work to enable `isolatedDeclarations`, we’ve substantially improved how often TypeScript can directly copy your input source code when producing declaration files.

For example, let’s say you wrote



```id
tsexport const strBool: string | boolean = "hello";export const boolStr: boolean | string = "world";
```



Note that the union types are equivalent, but the order of the union is different.
When emitting the declaration file, TypeScript has two equivalent output possibilities.

The first is to use a consistent canonical representation for each type:



```id
tsexport const strBool: string | boolean;export const boolStr: string | boolean;
```



The second is to re-use the type annotations exactly as written:



```id
tsexport const strBool: string | boolean;export const boolStr: boolean | string;
```



The second approach is generally preferable for a few reasons:

- Many equivalent representations still encode some level of intent that is better to preserve in the declaration file

- Producing a fresh representation of a type can be somewhat expensive, so avoiding is better

- User-written types are usually shorter than generated type representations

In 5.5, we’ve greatly improved the number of places where TypeScript can correctly identify places where it’s safe and correct to print back types exactly as they were written in the input file.
Many of these cases are invisible performance improvements - TypeScript would generate fresh sets of syntax nodes and serialize them into a string.
Instead, TypeScript can now operate over the original syntax nodes directly, which is much cheaper and faster.

### Caching Contextual Types from Discriminated Unions

When TypeScript asks for the contextual type of an expression like an object literal, it will often encounter a union type.
In those cases, TypeScript tries to filter out members of the union based on known properties with well known values (i.e. discriminant properties).
This work can be fairly expensive, especially if you end up with an object consisting of many many properties.
In TypeScript 5.5, much of the computation is cached once so that TypeScript doesn’t need to recompute it for every property in the object literal .
Performing this optimization shaved 250ms off of compiling the TypeScript compiler itself.

## Easier API Consumption from ECMAScript Modules

Previously, if you were writing an ECMAScript module in Node.js, named imports were not available from the `typescript` package.



```id
tsimport { createSourceFile } from "typescript"; // ❌ errorimport * as ts from "typescript";ts.createSourceFile // ❌ undefined???ts.default.createSourceFile // ✅ works - but ugh!
```



This is because cjs-module-lexer did not recognize the pattern of TypeScript’s generated CommonJS code.
This has been fixed, and users can now use named imports from the TypeScript npm package with ECMAScript modules in Node.js.



```id
tsimport { createSourceFile } from "typescript"; // ✅ works now!import * as ts from "typescript";ts.createSourceFile // ✅ works now!
```



For more information, see the change here .

## The `transpileDeclaration` API

TypeScript’s API exposes a function called `transpileModule`.
It’s intended to make it easy to compile a single file of TypeScript code.
Because it doesn’t have access to an entire program , the caveat is that it may not produce the right output if the code violates any errors under the `isolatedModules` option.

In TypeScript 5.5, we’ve added a new similar API called `transpileDeclaration`.
This API is similar to `transpileModule`, but it’s specifically designed to generate a single declaration file based on some input source text.
Just like `transpileModule`, it doesn’t have access to a full program, and a similar caveat applies: it only generates an accurate declaration file if the input code is free of errors under the new `isolatedDeclarations` option.

If desired, this function can be used to parallelize declaration emit across all files under `isolatedDeclarations` mode.

For more information, see the implementation here .

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### Disabling Features Deprecated in TypeScript 5.0

TypeScript 5.0 deprecated the following options and behaviors:

- `charset`

- `target: ES3`

- `importsNotUsedAsValues`

- `noImplicitUseStrict`

- `noStrictGenericChecks`

- `keyofStringsOnly`

- `suppressExcessPropertyErrors`

- `suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors`

- `out`

- `preserveValueImports`

- `prepend` in project references

- implicitly OS-specific `newLine`

To continue using the deprecated options above, developers using TypeScript 5.0 and other more recent versions have had to specify a new option called `ignoreDeprecations` with the value `"5.0"`.

In TypeScript 5.5, these options no longer have any effect.
To help with a smooth upgrade path, you may still specify them in your tsconfig, but these will be an error to specify in TypeScript 6.0.
See also the Flag Deprecation Plan which outlines our deprecation strategy.

 More information around these deprecation plans is available on GitHub , which contains suggestions in how to best adapt your codebase.

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see the DOM updates for TypeScript 5.5 .

### Stricter Parsing for Decorators

Since TypeScript originally introduced support for decorators, the specified grammar for the proposal has been tightened up.
TypeScript is now stricter about what forms it allows.
While rare, existing decorators may need to be parenthesized to avoid errors.



```id
tsclass DecoratorProvider {    decorate(...args: any[]) { }}class D extends DecoratorProvider {    m() {        class C {            @super.decorate // ❌ error            method1() { }            @(super.decorate) // ✅ okay            method2() { }        }    }}
```



See more information on the change here .

### `undefined` is No Longer a Definable Type Name

TypeScript has always disallowed type alias names that conflict with built-in types:



```id
ts// Illegaltype null = any;// Illegaltype number = any;// Illegaltype object = any;// Illegaltype any = any;
```



Due to a bug, this logic didn’t also apply to the built-in type `undefined`.
In 5.5, this is now correctly identified as an error:



```id
ts// Now also illegaltype undefined = any;
```



Bare references to type aliases named `undefined` never actually worked in the first place.
You could define them, but you couldn’t use them as an unqualified type name.



```id
tsexport type undefined = string;export const m: undefined = "";//           ^// Errors in 5.4 and earlier - the local definition of 'undefined' was not even consulted.
```



For more information, see the change here .

### Simplified Reference Directive Declaration Emit

When producing a declaration file, TypeScript would synthesize a reference directive when it believed one was required.
For example, all Node.js modules are declared ambiently, so cannot be loaded by module resolution alone.
A file like:



```id
tsximport path from "path";export const myPath = path.parse(__filename);
```



Would emit a declaration file like:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="node" />import path from "path";export declare const myPath: path.ParsedPath;
```



Even though the reference directive never appeared in the original source.

Similarly, TypeScript also removed reference directives that it did not believe needed to be a part of the output.
For example, let’s imagine we had a reference directive to `jest`;
however, imagine the reference directive isn’t necessary to generate the declaration file.
TypeScript would simply drop it.
So in the following example:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="jest" />import path from "path";export const myPath = path.parse(__filename);
```



TypeScript would still emit:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="node" />import path from "path";export declare const myPath: path.ParsedPath;
```



In the course of working on `isolatedDeclarations`, we realized that this logic was untenable for anyone attempting to implement a declaration emitter without type checking or using more than a single file’s context.
This behavior is also hard to understand from a user’s perspective; whether or not a reference directive appeared in the emitted file seems inconsistent and difficult to predict unless you understand exactly what’s going on during typechecking.
To prevent declaration emit from being different when `isolatedDeclarations` was enabled, we knew that our emit needed to change.

Through experimentation , we found that nearly all cases where TypeScript synthesized reference directives were just to pull in `node` or `react`.
These are cases where the expectation is that a downstream user already references those types through tsconfig.json `"types"` or library imports, so no longer synthesizing these reference directives would be unlikely to break anyone.
It’s worth noting that this is already how it works for `lib.d.ts`; TypeScript doesn’t synthesize a reference to `lib="es2015"` when a module exports a `WeakMap`, instead assuming that a downstream user will have included that as part of their environment.

For reference directives that had been written by library authors (not synthesized), further experimentation showed that nearly all were removed, never showing up in the output.
Most reference directives that were preserved were broken and likely not intended to be preserved.

Given those results, we decided to greatly simplfy reference directives in declaration emit in TypeScript 5.5.
A more consistent strategy will help library authors and consumers have better control of their declaration files.

Reference directives are no longer synthesized.
User-written reference directives are no longer preserved, unless annotated with a new `preserve="true"` attribute.
Concretely, an input file like:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="some-lib" preserve="true" />/// <reference types="jest" />import path from "path";export const myPath = path.parse(__filename);
```



will emit:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="some-lib" preserve="true" />import path from "path";export declare const myPath: path.ParsedPath;
```



Adding `preserve="true"` is backwards compatible with older versions of TypeScript as unknown attributes are ignored.

This change also improved performance; in our benchmarks, the emit stage saw a 1-4% improvement in projects with declaration emit enabled.

# DOM Manipulation

 

## DOM Manipulation

### An exploration into the `HTMLElement` type 

In the 20+ years since its standardization, JavaScript has come a very long way. While in 2020, JavaScript can be used on servers, in data science, and even on IoT devices, it is important to remember its most popular use case: web browsers.

Websites are made up of HTML and/or XML documents. These documents are static, they do not change. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface implemented by browsers to make static websites functional. The DOM API can be used to change the document structure, style, and content. The API is so powerful that countless frontend frameworks (jQuery, React, Angular, etc.) have been developed around it to make dynamic websites even easier to develop.

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, and it ships type definitions for the DOM API. These definitions are readily available in any default TypeScript project. Of the 20,000+ lines of definitions in lib.dom.d.ts , one stands out among the rest: `HTMLElement`. This type is the backbone for DOM manipulation with TypeScript.

 

You can explore the source code for the DOM type definitions 

 

## Basic Example

Given a simplified index.html file:



```id
html<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">  <head><title>TypeScript Dom Manipulation</title></head>  <body>    <div id="app"></div>    <!-- Assume index.js is the compiled output of index.ts -->    <script src="index.js"></script>  </body></html>
```



Let’s explore a TypeScript script that adds a ` Hello, World!

` element to the `#app` element. 


```id
ts// 1. Select the div element using the id propertyconst app = document.getElementById("app");// 2. Create a new <p></p> element programmaticallyconst p = document.createElement("p");// 3. Add the text contentp.textContent = "Hello, World!";// 4. Append the p element to the div elementapp?.appendChild(p);
```



After compiling and running the index.html page, the resulting HTML will be:



```id
html<div id="app">  <p>Hello, World!</p></div>
```



## The `Document` Interface

The first line of the TypeScript code uses a global variable `document`. Inspecting the variable shows it is defined by the `Document` interface from the lib.dom.d.ts file. The code snippet contains calls to two methods, `getElementById` and `createElement`.

### `Document.getElementById`

The definition for this method is as follows:



```id
tsgetElementById(elementId: string): HTMLElement | null;
```



Pass it an element id string and it will return either `HTMLElement` or `null`. This method introduces one of the most important types, `HTMLElement`. It serves as the base interface for every other element interface. For example, the `p` variable in the code example is of type `HTMLParagraphElement`. Also, take note that this method can return `null`. This is because the method can’t be certain pre-runtime if it will be able to actually find the specified element or not. In the last line of the code snippet, the new optional chaining operator is used to call `appendChild`.

### `Document.createElement`

The definition for this method is (I have omitted the deprecated definition):



```id
tscreateElement<K extends keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap>(tagName: K, options?: ElementCreationOptions): HTMLElementTagNameMap[K];createElement(tagName: string, options?: ElementCreationOptions): HTMLElement;
```



This is an overloaded function definition. The second overload is simplest and works a lot like the `getElementById` method does. Pass it any `string` and it will return a standard HTMLElement. This definition is what enables developers to create unique HTML element tags.

For example `document.createElement('xyz')` returns a ` ` element, clearly not an element that is specified by the HTML specification.

 

For those interested, you can interact with custom tag elements using the `document.getElementsByTagName`

 

For the first definition of `createElement`, it is using some advanced generic patterns. It is best understood broken down into chunks, starting with the generic expression: ` `. This expression defines a generic parameter `K` that is constrained to the keys of the interface `HTMLElementTagNameMap`. The map interface contains every specified HTML tag name and its corresponding type interface. For example here are the first 5 mapped values:



```id
tsinterface HTMLElementTagNameMap {    "a": HTMLAnchorElement;    "abbr": HTMLElement;    "address": HTMLElement;    "applet": HTMLAppletElement;    "area": HTMLAreaElement;        ...}
```



Some elements do not exhibit unique properties and so they just return `HTMLElement`, but other types do have unique properties and methods so they return their specific interface (which will extend from or implement `HTMLElement`).

Now, for the remainder of the `createElement` definition: 

```
(tagName: K, options?: ElementCreationOptions): HTMLElementTagNameMap[K]
```

. The first argument `tagName` is defined as the generic parameter `K`. The TypeScript interpreter is smart enough to infer the generic parameter from this argument. This means that the developer does not have to specify the generic parameter when using the method; whatever value is passed to the `tagName` argument will be inferred as `K` and thus can be used throughout the remainder of the definition. This is exactly what happens; the return value `HTMLElementTagNameMap[K]` takes the `tagName` argument and uses it to return the corresponding type. This definition is how the `p` variable from the code snippet gets a type of `HTMLParagraphElement`. And if the code was `document.createElement('a')`, then it would be an element of type `HTMLAnchorElement`.

## The `Node` interface

The `document.getElementById` function returns an `HTMLElement`. `HTMLElement` interface extends the `Element` interface which extends the `Node` interface. This prototypal extension allows for all `HTMLElements` to utilize a subset of standard methods. In the code snippet, we use a property defined on the `Node` interface to append the new `p` element to the website.

### `Node.appendChild`

The last line of the code snippet is `app?.appendChild(p)`. The previous, `document.getElementById`, section detailed that the optional chaining operator is used here because `app` can potentially be null at runtime. The `appendChild` method is defined by:



```id
tsappendChild<T extends Node>(newChild: T): T;
```



This method works similarly to the `createElement` method as the generic parameter `T` is inferred from the `newChild` argument. `T` is constrained to another base interface `Node`.

## Difference between `children` and `childNodes`

Previously, this document details the `HTMLElement` interface extends from `Element` which extends from `Node`. In the DOM API there is a concept of children elements. For example in the following HTML, the `p` tags are children of the `div` element



```id
tsx<div>  <p>Hello, World</p>  <p>TypeScript!</p></div>;const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0];div.children;// HTMLCollection(2) [p, p]div.childNodes;// NodeList(2) [p, p]
```



After capturing the `div` element, the `children` prop will return an `HTMLCollection` list containing the `HTMLParagraphElements`. The `childNodes` property will return a similar `NodeList` list of nodes. Each `p` tag will still be of type `HTMLParagraphElements`, but the `NodeList` can contain additional HTML nodes that the `HTMLCollection` list cannot.

Modify the HTML by removing one of the `p` tags, but keep the text.



```id
tsx<div>  <p>Hello, World</p>  TypeScript!</div>;const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0];div.children;// HTMLCollection(1) [p]div.childNodes;// NodeList(2) [p, text]
```



See how both lists change. `children` now only contains the ` Hello, World

` element, and the `childNodes` contains a `text` node rather than two `p` nodes. The `text` part of the `NodeList` is the literal `Node` containing the text `TypeScript!`. The `children` list does not contain this `Node` because it is not considered an `HTMLElement`. 

## The `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` methods

Both of these methods are great tools for getting lists of dom elements that fit a more unique set of constraints. They are defined in lib.dom.d.ts as:



```id
ts/** * Returns the first element that is a descendant of node that matches selectors. */querySelector<K extends keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap>(selectors: K): HTMLElementTagNameMap[K] | null;querySelector<K extends keyof SVGElementTagNameMap>(selectors: K): SVGElementTagNameMap[K] | null;querySelector<E extends Element = Element>(selectors: string): E | null;/** * Returns all element descendants of node that match selectors. */querySelectorAll<K extends keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap>(selectors: K): NodeListOf<HTMLElementTagNameMap[K]>;querySelectorAll<K extends keyof SVGElementTagNameMap>(selectors: K): NodeListOf<SVGElementTagNameMap[K]>;querySelectorAll<E extends Element = Element>(selectors: string): NodeListOf<E>;
```



The `querySelectorAll` definition is similar to `getElementsByTagName`, except it returns a new type: `NodeListOf`. This return type is essentially a custom implementation of the standard JavaScript list element. Arguably, replacing `NodeListOf ` with `E[]` would result in a very similar user experience. `NodeListOf` only implements the following properties and methods: `length`, `item(index)`, `forEach((value, key, parent) => void)`, and numeric indexing. Additionally, this method returns a list of elements , not nodes , which is what `NodeList` was returning from the `.childNodes` method. While this may appear as a discrepancy, take note that interface `Element` extends from `Node`.

To see these methods in action modify the existing code to:



```id
tsx<ul>  <li>First :)</li>  <li>Second!</li>  <li>Third times a charm.</li></ul>;const first = document.querySelector("li"); // returns the first li elementconst all = document.querySelectorAll("li"); // returns the list of all li elements
```



## Interested in learning more?

The best part about the lib.dom.d.ts type definitions is that they are reflective of the types annotated in the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation site. For example, the `HTMLElement` interface is documented by this HTMLElement page on MDN. These pages list all available properties, methods, and sometimes even examples. Another great aspect of the pages is that they provide links to the corresponding standard documents. Here is the link to the W3C Recommendation for HTMLElement .

# TypeScript 5.4

 

## Preserved Narrowing in Closures Following Last Assignments

TypeScript can usually figure out a more specific type for a variable based on checks that you might perform.
This process is called narrowing.



```id
tsfunction uppercaseStrings(x: string | number) {    if (typeof x === "string") {        // TypeScript knows 'x' is a 'string' here.        return x.toUpperCase();    }}
```



One common pain point was that these narrowed types weren’t always preserved within function closures.



```id
tsfunction getUrls(url: string | URL, names: string[]) {    if (typeof url === "string") {        url = new URL(url);    }    return names.map(name => {        url.searchParams.set("name", name)        //  ~~~~~~~~~~~~        // error!        // Property 'searchParams' does not exist on type 'string | URL'.        return url.toString();    });}
```



Here, TypeScript decided that it wasn’t “safe” to assume that `url` was actually a `URL` object in our callback function because it was mutated elsewhere;
however, in this instance, that arrow function is always created after that assignment to `url`, and it’s also the last assignment to `url`.

TypeScript 5.4 takes advantage of this to make narrowing a little smarter.
When parameters and `let` variables are used in non- hoisted functions, the type-checker will look for a last assignment point.
If one is found, TypeScript can safely narrow from outside the containing function.
What that means is the above example just works now.

Note that narrowing analysis doesn’t kick in if the variable is assigned anywhere in a nested function.
This is because there’s no way to know for sure whether the function will be called later.



```id
tsfunction printValueLater(value: string | undefined) {    if (value === undefined) {        value = "missing!";    }    setTimeout(() => {        // Modifying 'value', even in a way that shouldn't affect        // its type, will invalidate type refinements in closures.        value = value;    }, 500);    setTimeout(() => {        console.log(value.toUpperCase());        //          ~~~~~        // error! 'value' is possibly 'undefined'.    }, 1000);}
```



This should make lots of typical JavaScript code easier to express.
You can read more about the change on GitHub .

## The `NoInfer` Utility Type

When calling generic functions, TypeScript is able to infer type arguments from whatever you pass in.



```id
tsfunction doSomething<T>(arg: T) {    // ...}// We can explicitly say that 'T' should be 'string'.doSomething<string>("hello!");// We can also just let the type of 'T' get inferred.doSomething("hello!");
```



One challenge, however, is that it is not always clear what the “best” type is to infer.
This might lead to TypeScript rejecting valid calls, accepting questionable calls, or just reporting worse error messages when it catches a bug.

For example, let’s imagine a `createStreetLight` function that takes a list of color names, along with an optional default color.



```id
tsfunction createStreetLight<C extends string>(colors: C[], defaultColor?: C) {    // ...}createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "red");
```



What happens when we pass in a `defaultColor` that wasn’t in the original `colors` array?
In this function, `colors` is supposed to be the “source of truth” and describe what can be passed to `defaultColor`.



```id
ts// Oops! This is undesirable, but is allowed!createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "blue");
```



In this call, type inference decided that `"blue"` was just as valid of a type as `"red"` or `"yellow"` or `"green"`.
So instead of rejecting the call, TypeScript infers the type of `C` as `"red" | "yellow" | "green" | "blue"`.
You might say that inference just blue up in our faces!

One way people currently deal with this is to add a separate type parameter that’s bounded by the existing type parameter.



```id
tsfunction createStreetLight<C extends string, D extends C>(colors: C[], defaultColor?: D) {}createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "blue");//                                            ~~~~~~// error!// Argument of type '"blue"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"red" | "yellow" | "green" | undefined'.
```



This works, but is a little bit awkward because `D` probably won’t be used anywhere else in the signature for `createStreetLight`.
While not bad in this case , using a type parameter only once in a signature is often a code smell.

That’s why TypeScript 5.4 introduces a new `NoInfer ` utility type.
Surrounding a type in `NoInfer ` gives a signal to TypeScript not to dig in and match against the inner types to find candidates for type inference.

Using `NoInfer`, we can rewrite `createStreetLight` as something like this:



```id
tsfunction createStreetLight<C extends string>(colors: C[], defaultColor?: NoInfer<C>) {    // ...}createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "blue");//                                            ~~~~~~// error!// Argument of type '"blue"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"red" | "yellow" | "green" | undefined'.
```



Excluding the type of `defaultColor` from being explored for inference means that `"blue"` never ends up as an inference candidate, and the type-checker can reject it.

You can see the specific changes in the implementing pull request , along with the initial implementation provided thanks to Mateusz Burzyński !

## `Object.groupBy` and `Map.groupBy`

TypeScript 5.4 adds declarations for JavaScript’s new `Object.groupBy` and `Map.groupBy` static methods.

`Object.groupBy` takes an iterable, and a function that decides which “group” each element should be placed in.
The function needs to make a “key” for each distinct group, and `Object.groupBy` uses that key to make an object where every key maps to an array with the original element in it.

So the following JavaScript:



```id
jsconst array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];const myObj = Object.groupBy(array, (num, index) => {    return num % 2 === 0 ? "even": "odd";});
```



is basically equivalent to writing this:



```id
jsconst myObj = {    even: [0, 2, 4],    odd: [1, 3, 5],};
```



`Map.groupBy` is similar, but produces a `Map` instead of a plain object.
This might be more desirable if you need the guarantees of `Map`s, you’re dealing with APIs that expect `Map`s, or you need to use any kind of key for grouping - not just keys that can be used as property names in JavaScript.



```id
jsconst myObj = Map.groupBy(array, (num, index) => {    return num % 2 === 0 ? "even" : "odd";});
```



and just as before, you could have created `myObj` in an equivalent way:



```id
jsconst myObj = new Map();myObj.set("even", [0, 2, 4]);myObj.set("odd", [1, 3, 5]);
```



Note that in the above example of `Object.groupBy`, the object produced uses all optional properties.



```id
tsinterface EvenOdds {    even?: number[];    odd?: number[];}const myObj: EvenOdds = Object.groupBy(...);myObj.even;//    ~~~~// Error to access this under 'strictNullChecks'.
```



This is because there’s no way to guarantee in a general way that all the keys were produced by `groupBy`.

Note also that these methods are only accessible by configuring your `target` to `esnext` or adjusting your `lib` settings.
We expect they will eventually be available under a stable `es2024` target.

We’d like to extend a thanks to Kevin Gibbons for adding the declarations to these `groupBy` methods .

## Support for `require()` calls in `--moduleResolution bundler` and `--module preserve`

TypeScript has a `moduleResolution` option called `bundler` that is meant to model the way modern bundlers figure out which file an import path refers to.
One of the limitations of the option is that it had to be paired with `--module esnext`, making it impossible to use the `import ... = require(...)` syntax.



```id
ts// previously erroredimport myModule = require("module/path");
```



That might not seem like a big deal if you’re planning on just writing standard ECMAScript `import`s, but there’s a difference when using a package with conditional exports .

In TypeScript 5.4, `require()` can now be used when setting the `module` setting to a new option called `preserve`.

Between `--module preserve` and `--moduleResolution bundler`, the two more accurately model what bundlers and runtimes like Bun will allow, and how they’ll perform module lookups.
In fact, when using `--module preserve`, the `bundler` option will be implicitly set for `--moduleResolution` (along with `--esModuleInterop` and `--resolveJsonModule`)



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "module": "preserve",        // ^ also implies:        // "moduleResolution": "bundler",        // "esModuleInterop": true,        // "resolveJsonModule": true,        // ...    }}
```



Under `--module preserve`, an ECMAScript `import` will always be emitted as-is, and `import ... = require(...)` will be emitted as a `require()` call (though in practice you may not even use TypeScript for emit, since it’s likely you’ll be using a bundler for your code).
This holds true regardless of the file extension of the containing file.
So the output of this code:



```id
tsimport * as foo from "some-package/foo";import bar = require("some-package/bar");
```



should look something like this:



```id
jsimport * as foo from "some-package/foo";var bar = require("some-package/bar");
```



What this also means is that the syntax you choose directs how conditional exports are matched.
So in the above example, if the `package.json` of `some-package` looks like this:



```id
json{  "name": "some-package",  "version": "0.0.1",  "exports": {    "./foo": {        "import": "./esm/foo-from-import.mjs",        "require": "./cjs/foo-from-require.cjs"    },    "./bar": {        "import": "./esm/bar-from-import.mjs",        "require": "./cjs/bar-from-require.cjs"    }  }}
```



TypeScript will resolve these paths to `[...]/some-package/esm/foo-from-import.mjs` and `[...]/some-package/cjs/bar-from-require.cjs`.

For more information, you can read up on these new settings here .

## Checked Import Attributes and Assertions

Import attributes and assertions are now checked against the global `ImportAttributes` type.
This means that runtimes can now more accurately describe the import attributes



```id
ts// In some global file.interface ImportAttributes {    type: "json";}// In some other moduleimport * as ns from "foo" with { type: "not-json" };//                                     ~~~~~~~~~~// error!//// Type '{ type: "not-json"; }' is not assignable to type 'ImportAttributes'.//  Types of property 'type' are incompatible.//    Type '"not-json"' is not assignable to type '"json"'.
```



 This change was provided thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk .

## Quick Fix for Adding Missing Parameters

TypeScript now has a quick fix to add a new parameter to functions that are called with too many arguments.

 

 

This can be useful when threading a new argument through several existing functions, which can be cumbersome today.

 This quick fix was provided courtsey of Oleksandr Tarasiuk .

## Upcoming Changes from TypeScript 5.0 Deprecations

TypeScript 5.0 deprecated the following options and behaviors:

 `charset`

- `target: ES3`

- `importsNotUsedAsValues`

- `noImplicitUseStrict`

- `noStrictGenericChecks`

- `keyofStringsOnly`

- `suppressExcessPropertyErrors`

- `suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors`

- `out`

- `preserveValueImports`

- `prepend` in project references

- implicitly OS-specific `newLine`

To continue using them, developers using TypeScript 5.0 and other more recent versions have had to specify a new option called `ignoreDeprecations` with the value `"5.0"`.

However, TypScript 5.4 will be the last version in which these will continue to function as normal.
By TypeScript 5.5 (likely June 2024), these will become hard errors, and code using them will need to be migrated away.

For more information, you can read up on this plan on GitHub , which contains suggestions in how to best adapt your codebase.

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see the DOM updates for TypeScript 5.4 .

### More Accurate Conditional Type Constraints

The following code no longer allows the second variable declaration in the function `foo`.



```id
tstype IsArray<T> = T extends any[] ? true : false;function foo<U extends object>(x: IsArray<U>) {    let first: true = x;    // Error    let second: false = x;  // Error, but previously wasn't}
```



Previously, when TypeScript checked the initializer for `second`, it needed to determine whether `IsArray ` was assignable to the unit type `false`.
While `IsArray ` isn’t compatible any obvious way, TypeScript looks at the constraint of that type as well.
In a conditional type like `T extends Foo ? TrueBranch : FalseBranch`, where `T` is generic, the type system would look at the constraint of `T`, substitute it in for `T` itself, and decide on either the true or false branch.

But this behavior was inaccurate because it was overly eager.
Even if the constraint of `T` isn’t assignable to `Foo`, that doesn’t mean that it won’t be instantiated with something that is.
And so the more correct behavior is to produce a union type for the constraint of the conditional type in cases where it can’t be proven that `T` never or always extends `Foo.`

TypeScript 5.4 adopts this more accurate behavior.
What this means in practice is that you may begin to find that some conditional type instances are no longer compatible with their branches.

 You can read about the specific changes here .

### More Aggressive Reduction of Intersections Between Type Variables and Primitive Types

TypeScript now reduces intersections with type variables and primitives more aggressively, depending on how the type variable’s constraint overlaps with those primitives.



```id
tsdeclare function intersect<T, U>(x: T, y: U): T & U;function foo<T extends "abc" | "def">(x: T, str: string, num: number) {    // Was 'T & string', now is just 'T'    let a = intersect(x, str);    // Was 'T & number', now is just 'never'    let b = intersect(x, num)    // Was '(T & "abc") | (T & "def")', now is just 'T'    let c = Math.random() < 0.5 ?        intersect(x, "abc") :        intersect(x, "def");}
```



For more information, see the change here .

### Improved Checking Against Template Strings with Interpolations

TypeScript now more accurately checks whether or not strings are assignable to the placeholder slots of a template string type.



```id
tsfunction a<T extends {id: string}>() {    let x: `-${keyof T & string}`;        // Used to error, now doesn't.    x = "-id";}
```



This behavior is more desirable, but may cause breaks in code using constructs like conditional types, where these rule changes are easy to witness.

 See this change for more details.

### Errors When Type-Only Imports Conflict with Local Values

Previously, TypeScript would permit the following code under `isolatedModules` if the import to `Something` only referred to a type.



```id
tsimport { Something } from "./some/path";let Something = 123;
```



However, it’s not safe for single-file compilers to assume whether it’s “safe” to drop the `import`, even if the code is guaranteed to fail at runtime.
In TypeScript 5.4, this code will trigger an error like the following:



```
Import 'Something' conflicts with local value, so must be declared with a type-only import when 'isolatedModules' is enabled.
```



The fix should be to either make a local rename, or, as the error states, add the `type` modifier to the import:



```id
tsimport type { Something } from "./some/path";// orimport { type Something } from "./some/path";
```



 See more information on the change itself .

### New Enum Assignability Restrictions

When two enums have the same declared names and enum member names, they were previously always considered compatible;
however, when the values were known, TypeScript would silently allow them to have differing values.

TypeScript 5.4 tightens this restriction by requiring the values to be identical when they are known.



```id
tsnamespace First {    export enum SomeEnum {        A = 0,        B = 1,    }}namespace Second {    export enum SomeEnum {        A = 0,        B = 2,    }}function foo(x: First.SomeEnum, y: Second.SomeEnum) {    // Both used to be compatible - no longer the case,    // TypeScript errors with something like:    //    //  Each declaration of 'SomeEnum.B' differs in its value, where '1' was expected but '2' was given.    x = y;    y = x;}
```



Additionally, there are new restrictions for when one of the enum members does not have a statically known value.
In these cases, the other enum must at least be implicitly numeric (e.g. it has no statically resolved initializer), or it is explicitly numeric (meaning TypeScript could resolve the value to something numeric).
Practically speaking, what this means is that string enum members are only ever compatible with other string enums of the same value.



```id
tsnamespace First {    export declare enum SomeEnum {        A,        B,    }}namespace Second {    export declare enum SomeEnum {        A,        B = "some known string",    }}function foo(x: First.SomeEnum, y: Second.SomeEnum) {    // Both used to be compatible - no longer the case,    // TypeScript errors with something like:    //    //  One value of 'SomeEnum.B' is the string '"some known string"', and the other is assumed to be an unknown numeric value.    x = y;    y = x;}
```



For more information, see the pull request that introduced this change .

### Name Restrictions on Enum Members

TypeScript no longer allows enum members to use the names `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, or `NaN`.



```id
ts// Errors on all of these:////  An enum member cannot have a numeric name.enum E {    Infinity = 0,    "-Infinity" = 1,    NaN = 2,}
```



 See more details here .

### Better Mapped Type Preservation Over Tuples with `any` Rest Elements

Previously, applying a mapped type with `any` into a tuple would create an `any` element type.
This is undesirable and is now fixed.



```id
tsPromise.all(["", ...([] as any)])    .then((result) => {        const head = result[0];       // 5.3: any, 5.4: string        const tail = result.slice(1); // 5.3 any, 5.4: any[]    });
```



For more information, see the fix along with the follow-on discussion around behavioral changes and further tweaks .

### Emit Changes

While not a breaking change per se, developers may have implicitly taken dependencies on TypeScript’s JavaScript or declaration emit outputs.
The following are notable changes.

- Preserve type parameter names more often when shadowed 

- Move complex parameter lists of async function into downlevel generator body 

- Do not remove binding alias in function declarations 

- ImportAttributes should go through the same emit phases when in an ImportTypeNode

# Migrating from JavaScript

 

TypeScript doesn’t exist in a vacuum.
It was built with the JavaScript ecosystem in mind, and a lot of JavaScript exists today.
Converting a JavaScript codebase over to TypeScript is, while somewhat tedious, usually not challenging.
In this tutorial, we’re going to look at how you might start out.
We assume you’ve read enough of the handbook to write new TypeScript code.

If you’re looking to convert a React project, we recommend looking at the React Conversion Guide first.

## Setting up your Directories

If you’re writing in plain JavaScript, it’s likely that you’re running your JavaScript directly,
where your `.js` files are in a `src`, `lib`, or `dist` directory, and then run as desired.

If that’s the case, the files that you’ve written are going to be used as inputs to TypeScript, and you’ll run the outputs it produces.
During our JS to TS migration, we’ll need to separate our input files to prevent TypeScript from overwriting them.
If your output files need to reside in a specific directory, then that will be your output directory.

You might also be running some intermediate steps on your JavaScript, such as bundling or using another transpiler like Babel.
In this case, you might already have a folder structure like this set up.

From this point on, we’re going to assume that your directory is set up something like this:



```
projectRoot├── src│   ├── file1.js│   └── file2.js├── built└── tsconfig.json
```



If you have a `tests` folder outside of your `src` directory, you might have one `tsconfig.json` in `src`, and one in `tests` as well.

## Writing a Configuration File

TypeScript uses a file called `tsconfig.json` for managing your project’s options, such as which files you want to include, and what sorts of checking you want to perform.
Let’s create a bare-bones one for our project:



```id
json{  "compilerOptions": {    "outDir": "./built",    "allowJs": true,    "target": "es5"  },  "include": ["./src/**/*"]}
```



Here we’re specifying a few things to TypeScript:

 Read in any files it understands in the `src` directory (with `include` ).

- Accept JavaScript files as inputs (with `allowJs` ).

- Emit all of the output files in `built` (with `outDir` ).

- Translate newer JavaScript constructs down to an older version like ECMAScript 5 (using `target` ).

At this point, if you try running `tsc` at the root of your project, you should see output files in the `built` directory.
The layout of files in `built` should look identical to the layout of `src`.
You should now have TypeScript working with your project.

## Early Benefits

Even at this point you can get some great benefits from TypeScript understanding your project.
If you open up an editor like VS Code or Visual Studio , you’ll see that you can often get some tooling support like completion.
You can also catch certain bugs with options like:

- `noImplicitReturns` which prevents you from forgetting to return at the end of a function.

- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` which is helpful if you never want to forget a `break` statement between `case`s in a `switch` block.

TypeScript will also warn about unreachable code and labels, which you can disable with `allowUnreachableCode` and `allowUnusedLabels` respectively.

## Integrating with Build Tools

You might have some more build steps in your pipeline.
Perhaps you concatenate something to each of your files.
Each build tool is different, but we’ll do our best to cover the gist of things.

### Gulp

If you’re using Gulp in some fashion, we have a tutorial on using Gulp with TypeScript, and integrating with common build tools like Browserify, Babelify, and Uglify.
You can read more there.

### Webpack

Webpack integration is pretty simple.
You can use `ts-loader`, a TypeScript loader, combined with `source-map-loader` for easier debugging.
Simply run



```id
shellnpm install ts-loader source-map-loader
```



and merge in options from the following into your `webpack.config.js` file:



```id
jsmodule.exports = {  entry: "./src/index.ts",  output: {    filename: "./dist/bundle.js",  },  // Enable sourcemaps for debugging webpack's output.  devtool: "source-map",  resolve: {    // Add '.ts' and '.tsx' as resolvable extensions.    extensions: ["", ".webpack.js", ".web.js", ".ts", ".tsx", ".js"],  },  module: {    rules: [      // All files with a '.ts' or '.tsx' extension will be handled by 'ts-loader'.      { test: /\.tsx?$/, loader: "ts-loader" },      // All output '.js' files will have any sourcemaps re-processed by 'source-map-loader'.      { test: /\.js$/, loader: "source-map-loader" },    ],  },  // Other options...};
```



It’s important to note that ts-loader will need to run before any other loader that deals with `.js` files.

You can see an example of using Webpack in our tutorial on React and Webpack .

## Moving to TypeScript Files

At this point, you’re probably ready to start using TypeScript files.
The first step is to rename one of your `.js` files to `.ts`.
If your file uses JSX, you’ll need to rename it to `.tsx`.

Finished with that step?
Great!
You’ve successfully migrated a file from JavaScript to TypeScript!

Of course, that might not feel right.
If you open that file in an editor with TypeScript support (or if you run `tsc --pretty`), you might see red squiggles on certain lines.
You should think of these the same way you’d think of red squiggles in an editor like Microsoft Word.
TypeScript will still translate your code, just like Word will still let you print your documents.

If that sounds too lax for you, you can tighten that behavior up.
If, for instance, you don’t want TypeScript to compile to JavaScript in the face of errors, you can use the `noEmitOnError` option.
In that sense, TypeScript has a dial on its strictness, and you can turn that knob up as high as you want.

If you plan on using the stricter settings that are available, it’s best to turn them on now (see Getting Stricter Checks below).
For instance, if you never want TypeScript to silently infer `any` for a type without you explicitly saying so, you can use `noImplicitAny` before you start modifying your files.
While it might feel somewhat overwhelming, the long-term gains become apparent much more quickly.

### Weeding out Errors

Like we mentioned, it’s not unexpected to get error messages after conversion.
The important thing is to actually go one by one through these and decide how to deal with the errors.
Often these will be legitimate bugs, but sometimes you’ll have to explain what you’re trying to do a little better to TypeScript.

#### Importing from Modules

You might start out getting a bunch of errors like `Cannot find name 'require'.`, and `Cannot find name 'define'.`.
In these cases, it’s likely that you’re using modules.
While you can just convince TypeScript that these exist by writing out



```id
ts// For Node/CommonJSdeclare function require(path: string): any;
```



or



```id
ts// For RequireJS/AMDdeclare function define(...args: any[]): any;
```



it’s better to get rid of those calls and use TypeScript syntax for imports.

First, you’ll need to enable some module system by setting TypeScript’s `module` option.
Valid options are `commonjs`, `amd`, `system`, and `umd`.

If you had the following Node/CommonJS code:



```id
jsvar foo = require("foo");foo.doStuff();
```



or the following RequireJS/AMD code:



```id
jsdefine(["foo"], function (foo) {  foo.doStuff();});
```



then you would write the following TypeScript code:



```id
tsimport foo = require("foo");foo.doStuff();
```



#### Getting Declaration Files

If you started converting over to TypeScript imports, you’ll probably run into errors like `Cannot find module 'foo'.`.
The issue here is that you likely don’t have declaration files to describe your library.
Luckily this is pretty easy.
If TypeScript complains about a package like `lodash`, you can just write



```id
shellnpm install -S @types/lodash
```



If you’re using a module option other than `commonjs`, you’ll need to set your `moduleResolution` option to `node`.

After that, you’ll be able to import lodash with no issues, and get accurate completions.

#### Exporting from Modules

Typically, exporting from a module involves adding properties to a value like `exports` or `module.exports`.
TypeScript allows you to use top-level export statements.
For instance, if you exported a function like so:



```id
jsmodule.exports.feedPets = function (pets) {  // ...};
```



you could write that out as the following:



```id
tsexport function feedPets(pets) {  // ...}
```



Sometimes you’ll entirely overwrite the exports object.
This is a common pattern people use to make their modules immediately callable like in this snippet:



```id
jsvar express = require("express");var app = express();
```



You might have previously written that like so:



```id
jsfunction foo() {  // ...}module.exports = foo;
```



In TypeScript, you can model this with the `export =` construct.



```id
tsfunction foo() {  // ...}export = foo;
```



#### Too many/too few arguments

You’ll sometimes find yourself calling a function with too many/few arguments.
Typically, this is a bug, but in some cases, you might have declared a function that uses the `arguments` object instead of writing out any parameters:



```id
jsfunction myCoolFunction() {  if (arguments.length == 2 && !Array.isArray(arguments[1])) {    var f = arguments[0];    var arr = arguments[1];    // ...  }  // ...}myCoolFunction(  function (x) {    console.log(x);  },  [1, 2, 3, 4]);myCoolFunction(  function (x) {    console.log(x);  },  1,  2,  3,  4);
```



In this case, we need to use TypeScript to tell any of our callers about the ways `myCoolFunction` can be called using function overloads.



```id
tsfunction myCoolFunction(f: (x: number) => void, nums: number[]): void;function myCoolFunction(f: (x: number) => void, ...nums: number[]): void;function myCoolFunction() {  if (arguments.length == 2 && !Array.isArray(arguments[1])) {    var f = arguments[0];    var arr = arguments[1];    // ...  }  // ...}
```



We added two overload signatures to `myCoolFunction`.
The first checks states that `myCoolFunction` takes a function (which takes a `number`), and then a list of `number`s.
The second one says that it will take a function as well, and then uses a rest parameter (`...nums`) to state that any number of arguments after that need to be `number`s.

#### Sequentially Added Properties

Some people find it more aesthetically pleasing to create an object and add properties immediately after like so:



```id
jsvar options = {};options.color = "red";options.volume = 11;
```



TypeScript will say that you can’t assign to `color` and `volume` because it first figured out the type of `options` as `{}` which doesn’t have any properties.
If you instead moved the declarations into the object literal themselves, you’d get no errors:



```id
tslet options = {  color: "red",  volume: 11,};
```



You could also define the type of `options` and add a type assertion on the object literal.



```id
tsinterface Options {  color: string;  volume: number;}let options = {} as Options;options.color = "red";options.volume = 11;
```



Alternatively, you can just say `options` has the type `any` which is the easiest thing to do, but which will benefit you the least.

#### `any`, `Object`, and `{}`

You might be tempted to use `Object` or `{}` to say that a value can have any property on it because `Object` is, for most purposes, the most general type.
However `any` is actually the type you want to use in those situations, since it’s the most flexible type.

For instance, if you have something that’s typed as `Object` you won’t be able to call methods like `toLowerCase()` on it.
Being more general usually means you can do less with a type, but `any` is special in that it is the most general type while still allowing you to do anything with it.
That means you can call it, construct it, access properties on it, etc.
Keep in mind though, whenever you use `any`, you lose out on most of the error checking and editor support that TypeScript gives you.

If a decision ever comes down to `Object` and `{}`, you should prefer `{}`.
While they are mostly the same, technically `{}` is a more general type than `Object` in certain esoteric cases.

### Getting Stricter Checks

TypeScript comes with certain checks to give you more safety and analysis of your program.
Once you’ve converted your codebase to TypeScript, you can start enabling these checks for greater safety.

#### No Implicit `any`

There are certain cases where TypeScript can’t figure out what certain types should be.
To be as lenient as possible, it will decide to use the type `any` in its place.
While this is great for migration, using `any` means that you’re not getting any type safety, and you won’t get the same tooling support you’d get elsewhere.
You can tell TypeScript to flag these locations down and give an error with the `noImplicitAny` option.

#### Strict `null` & `undefined` Checks

By default, TypeScript assumes that `null` and `undefined` are in the domain of every type.
That means anything declared with the type `number` could be `null` or `undefined`.
Since `null` and `undefined` are such a frequent source of bugs in JavaScript and TypeScript, TypeScript has the `strictNullChecks` option to spare you the stress of worrying about these issues.

When `strictNullChecks` is enabled, `null` and `undefined` get their own types called `null` and `undefined` respectively.
Whenever anything is possibly `null`, you can use a union type with the original type.
So for instance, if something could be a `number` or `null`, you’d write the type out as `number | null`.

If you ever have a value that TypeScript thinks is possibly `null`/`undefined`, but you know better, you can use the postfix `!` operator to tell it otherwise.



```id
tsdeclare var foo: string[] | null;foo.length; // error - 'foo' is possibly 'null'foo!.length; // okay - 'foo!' just has type 'string[]'
```



As a heads up, when using `strictNullChecks` , your dependencies may need to be updated to use `strictNullChecks` as well.

#### No Implicit `any` for `this`

When you use the `this` keyword outside of classes, it has the type `any` by default.
For instance, imagine a `Point` class, and imagine a function that we wish to add as a method:



```id
tsclass Point {  constructor(public x, public y) {}  getDistance(p: Point) {    let dx = p.x - this.x;    let dy = p.y - this.y;    return Math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2);  }}// ...// Reopen the interface.interface Point {  distanceFromOrigin(): number;}Point.prototype.distanceFromOrigin = function () {  return this.getDistance({ x: 0, y: 0 });};
```



This has the same problems we mentioned above - we could easily have misspelled `getDistance` and not gotten an error.
For this reason, TypeScript has the `noImplicitThis` option.
When that option is set, TypeScript will issue an error when `this` is used without an explicit (or inferred) type.
The fix is to use a `this`-parameter to give an explicit type in the interface or in the function itself:



```id
tsPoint.prototype.distanceFromOrigin = function (this: Point) {  return this.getDistance({ x: 0, y: 0 });};
```

# TypeScript 5.3

 

## Import Attributes

TypeScript 5.3 supports the latest updates to the import attributes proposal.

One use-case of import attributes is to provide information about the expected format of a module to the runtime.



```id
ts// We only want this to be interpreted as JSON,// not a runnable/malicious JavaScript file with a `.json` extension.import obj from "./something.json" with { type: "json" };
```



The contents of these attributes are not checked by TypeScript since they’re host-specific, and are simply left alone so that browsers and runtimes can handle them (and possibly error).



```id
ts// TypeScript is fine with this.// But your browser? Probably not.import * as foo from "./foo.js" with { type: "fluffy bunny" };
```



Dynamic `import()` calls can also use import attributes through a second argument.



```id
tsconst obj = await import("./something.json", {    with: { type: "json" }});
```



The expected type of that second argument is defined by a type called `ImportCallOptions`, which by default just expects a property called `with`.

Note that import attributes are an evolution of an earlier proposal called “import assertions”, which were implemented in TypeScript 4.5 .
The most obvious difference is the use of the `with` keyword over the `assert` keyword.
But the less-visible difference is that runtimes are now free to use attributes to guide the resolution and interpretation of import paths, whereas import assertions could only assert some characteristics after loading a module.

Over time, TypeScript will be deprecating the old syntax for import assertions in favor of the proposed syntax for import attributes.
Existing code using `assert` should migrate towards the `with` keyword.
New code that needs an import attribute should use `with` exclusively.

We’d like to thank Oleksandr Tarasiuk for implementing this proposal !
And we’d also like to call out Wenlu Wang for their implementation of import assertions !

## Stable Support `resolution-mode` in Import Types

In TypeScript 4.7, TypeScript added support for a `resolution-mode` attribute in `/// ` to control whether a specifier should be resolved via `import` or `require` semantics.



```id
ts/// <reference types="pkg" resolution-mode="require" />// or/// <reference types="pkg" resolution-mode="import" />
```



A corresponding field was added to import assertions on type-only imports as well;
however, it was only supported in nightly versions of TypeScript.
The rationale was that in spirit, import assertions were not intended to guide module resolution.
So this feature was shipped experimentally in a nightly-only mode to get more feedback.

But given that import attributes can guide resolution, and that we’ve seen reasonable use-cases, TypeScript 5.3 now supports the `resolution-mode` attribute for `import type`.



```id
ts// Resolve `pkg` as if we were importing with a `require()`import type { TypeFromRequire } from "pkg" with {    "resolution-mode": "require"};// Resolve `pkg` as if we were importing with an `import`import type { TypeFromImport } from "pkg" with {    "resolution-mode": "import"};export interface MergedType extends TypeFromRequire, TypeFromImport {}
```



These import attributes can also be used on `import()` types.



```id
tsexport type TypeFromRequire =    import("pkg", { with: { "resolution-mode": "require" } }).TypeFromRequire;export type TypeFromImport =    import("pkg", { with: { "resolution-mode": "import" } }).TypeFromImport;export interface MergedType extends TypeFromRequire, TypeFromImport {}
```



For more information, check out the change here 

## `resolution-mode` Supported in All Module Modes

Previously, using `resolution-mode` was only allowed under the `moduleResolution` options `node16` and `nodenext`.
To make it easier to look up modules specifically for type purposes, `resolution-mode` now works appropriately in all other `moduleResolution` options like `bundler`, `node10`, and simply doesn’t error under `classic`.

For more information, see the implementing pull request .

## `switch (true)` Narrowing

TypeScript 5.3 now can perform narrowing based on conditions in each `case` clause within a `switch (true)`.



```id
tsfunction f(x: unknown) {    switch (true) {        case typeof x === "string":            // 'x' is a 'string' here            console.log(x.toUpperCase());            // falls through...        case Array.isArray(x):            // 'x' is a 'string | any[]' here.            console.log(x.length);            // falls through...        default:          // 'x' is 'unknown' here.          // ...    }}
```



 This feature was spearheaded initial work by Mateusz Burzyński 
We’d like to extend a “thank you!” for this contribution.

## Narrowing On Comparisons to Booleans

Occasionally you may find yourself performing a direct comparison with `true` or `false` in a condition.
Usually these are unnecessary comparisons, but you might prefer it as a point of style, or to avoid certain issues around JavaScript truthiness.
Regardless, previously TypeScript just didn’t recognize such forms when performing narrowing.

TypeScript 5.3 now keeps up and understands these expressions when narrowing variables.



```id
tsinterface A {    a: string;}interface B {    b: string;}type MyType = A | B;function isA(x: MyType): x is A {    return "a" in x;}function someFn(x: MyType) {    if (isA(x) === true) {        console.log(x.a); // works!    }}
```



We’d like to thank Mateusz Burzyński for the pull request that implemented this.

## `instanceof` Narrowing Through `Symbol.hasInstance`

A slightly esoteric feature of JavaScript is that it is possible to override the behavior of the `instanceof` operator.
To do so, the value on the right side of the `instanceof` operator needs to have a specific method named by `Symbol.hasInstance`.



```id
jsclass Weirdo {    static [Symbol.hasInstance](testedValue) {        // wait, what?        return testedValue === undefined;    }}// falseconsole.log(new Thing() instanceof Weirdo);// trueconsole.log(undefined instanceof Weirdo);
```



To better model this behavior in `instanceof`, TypeScript now checks if such a `[Symbol.hasInstance]` method exists and is declared as a type predicate function.
If it does, the tested value on the left side of the `instanceof` operator will be narrowed appropriately by that type predicate.



```id
tsinterface PointLike {    x: number;    y: number;}class Point implements PointLike {    x: number;    y: number;    constructor(x: number, y: number) {        this.x = x;        this.y = y;    }    distanceFromOrigin() {        return Math.sqrt(this.x ** 2 + this.y ** 2);    }    static [Symbol.hasInstance](val: unknown): val is PointLike {        return !!val && typeof val === "object" &&            "x" in val && "y" in val &&            typeof val.x === "number" &&            typeof val.y === "number";    }}function f(value: unknown) {    if (value instanceof Point) {        // Can access both of these - correct!        value.x;        value.y;        // Can't access this - we have a 'PointLike',        // but we don't *actually* have a 'Point'.        value.distanceFromOrigin();    }}
```



As you can see in this example, `Point` defines its own `[Symbol.hasInstance]` method.
It actually acts as a custom type guard over a separate type called `PointLike`.
In the function `f`, we were able to narrow `value` down to a `PointLike` with `instanceof`, but not a `Point`.
That means that we can access the properties `x` and `y`, but not the method `distanceFromOrigin`.

For more information, you can read up on this change here .

## Checks for `super` Property Accesses on Instance Fields

In JavaScript, it’s possible to access a declaration in a base class through the `super` keyword.



```id
jsclass Base {    someMethod() {        console.log("Base method called!");    }}class Derived extends Base {    someMethod() {        console.log("Derived method called!");        super.someMethod();    }}new Derived().someMethod();// Prints://   Derived method called!//   Base method called!
```



This is different from writing something like `this.someMethod()`, since that could invoke an overridden method.
This is a subtle distinction, made more subtle by the fact that often the two can be interchangeable if a declaration is never overridden at all.



```id
jsclass Base {    someMethod() {        console.log("someMethod called!");    }}class Derived extends Base {    someOtherMethod() {        // These act identically.        this.someMethod();        super.someMethod();    }}new Derived().someOtherMethod();// Prints://   someMethod called!//   someMethod called!
```



The problem is using them interchangeably is that `super` only works on members declared on the prototype — not instance properties.
That means that if you wrote `super.someMethod()`, but `someMethod` was defined as a field, you’d get a runtime error!



```id
tsclass Base {    someMethod = () => {        console.log("someMethod called!");    }}class Derived extends Base {    someOtherMethod() {        super.someMethod();    }}new Derived().someOtherMethod();// 💥// Doesn't work because 'super.someMethod' is 'undefined'.
```



TypeScript 5.3 now more-closely inspects `super` property accesses/method calls to see if they correspond to class fields.
If they do, we’ll now get a type-checking error.

 This check was contributed thanks to Jack Works !

## Interactive Inlay Hints for Types

TypeScript’s inlay hints now support jumping to the definition of types!
This makes it easier to casually navigate your code.

 

See more at the implementation here .

## Settings to Prefer `type` Auto-Imports

Previously when TypeScript generated auto-imports for something in a type position, it would add a `type` modifier based on your settings.
For example, when getting an auto-import on `Person` in the following:



```id
tsexport let p: Person
```



TypeScript’s editing experience would usually add an import for `Person` as:



```id
tsimport { Person } from "./types";export let p: Person
```



and under certain settings like `verbatimModuleSyntax`, it would add the `type` modifier:



```id
tsimport { type Person } from "./types";export let p: Person
```



However, maybe your codebase isn’t able to use some of these options; or you just have a preference for explicit `type` imports when possible.

 With a recent change , TypeScript now enables this to be an editor-specific option.
In Visual Studio Code, you can enable it in the UI under “TypeScript › Preferences: Prefer Type Only Auto Imports”, or as the JSON configuration option `typescript.preferences.preferTypeOnlyAutoImports`

 

## Optimizations by Skipping JSDoc Parsing

When running TypeScript via `tsc`, the compiler will now avoid parsing JSDoc.
This drops parsing time on its own, but also reduces memory usage to store comments along with time spent in garbage collection.
All-in-all, you should see slightly faster compiles and quicker feedback in `--watch` mode.

 The specific changes can be viewed here .

Because not every tool using TypeScript will need to store JSDoc (e.g. typescript-eslint and Prettier), this parsing strategy has been surfaced as part of the API itself.
This can enable these tools to gain the same memory and speed improvements we’ve brought to the TypeScript compiler.
The new options for comment parsing strategy are described in `JSDocParsingMode`.
More information is available on this pull request .

## Optimizations by Comparing Non-Normalized Intersections

In TypeScript, unions and intersections always follow a specific form, where intersections can’t contain union types.
That means that when we create an intersection over a union like `A & (B | C)`, that intersection will be normalized into `(A & B) | (A & C)`.
Still, in some cases the type system will maintain the original form for display purposes.

It turns out that the original form can be used for some clever fast-path comparisons between types.

For example, let’s say we have 

```
SomeType & (Type1 | Type2 | ... | Type99999NINE)
```

 and we want to see if that’s assignable to `SomeType`.
Recall that we don’t really have an intersection as our source type — we have a union that looks like 

```
(SomeType & Type1) | (SomeType & Type2) | ... |(SomeType & Type99999NINE)
```

.
When checking if a union is assignable to some target type, we have to check if every member of the union is assignable to the target type, and that can be very slow.

In TypeScript 5.3, we peek at the original intersection form that we were able to tuck away.
When we compare the types, we do a quick check to see if the target exists in any constituent of the source intersection.

For more information, see this pull request .

## Consolidation Between `tsserverlibrary.js` and `typescript.js`

TypeScript itself ships two library files: `tsserverlibrary.js` and `typescript.js`.
There are certain APIs available only in `tsserverlibrary.js` (like the `ProjectService` API), which may be useful to some importers.
Still, the two are distinct bundles with a lot of overlap, duplicating code in the package.
What’s more, it can be challenging to consistently use one over the other due to auto-imports or muscle memory.
Accidentally loading both modules is far too easy, and code may not work properly on a different instance of the API.
Even if it does work, loading a second bundle increases resource usage.

Given this, we’ve decided to consolidate the two.
`typescript.js` now contains what `tsserverlibrary.js` used to contain, and `tsserverlibrary.js` now simply re-exports `typescript.js`.
Comparing the before/after of this consolidation, we saw the following reduction in package size:

## Breaking Changes and Correctness Improvements

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on your codebase.
For more information, see the DOM updates for TypeScript 5.3 .

### Checks for `super` Accesses on Instance Properties

TypeScript 5.3 now detects when the declaration referenced by a `super.` property access is a class field and issues an error.
This prevents errors that might occur at runtime.

# Using Babel with TypeScript

 

## Babel vs `tsc` for TypeScript

When making a modern JavaScript project, you might ask yourself what is the right way to convert files from TypeScript to JavaScript?

A lot of the time the answer is “it depends” , or “someone may have decided for you” depending on the project. If you are building your project with an existing framework like tsdx , Angular , NestJS or any framework mentioned in the Getting Started then this decision is handled for you.

However, a useful heuristic could be:

 Is your build output mostly the same as your source input files? Use `tsc`

- Do you need a build pipeline with multiple potential outputs? Use `babel` for transpiling and `tsc` for type checking

## Babel for transpiling, `tsc` for types

This is a common pattern for projects with existing build infrastructure which may have been ported from a JavaScript codebase to TypeScript.

This technique is a hybrid approach, using Babel’s preset-typescript to generate your JS files, and then using TypeScript to do type checking and `.d.ts` file generation.

By using babel’s support for TypeScript, you get the ability to work with existing build pipelines and are more likely to have a faster JS emit time because Babel does not type check your code.

#### Type Checking and d.ts file generation

The downside to using babel is that you don’t get type checking during the transition from TS to JS. This can mean that type errors which you miss in your editor could sneak through into production code.

In addition to that, Babel cannot create `.d.ts` files for your TypeScript which can make it harder to work with your project if it is a library.

To fix these issues, you would probably want to set up a command to type check your project using TSC. This likely means duplicating some of your babel config into a corresponding `tsconfig.json` and ensuring these flags are enabled:



```
"compilerOptions": {  // Ensure that .d.ts files are created by tsc, but not .js files  "declaration": true,  "emitDeclarationOnly": true,  // Ensure that Babel can safely transpile files in the TypeScript project  "isolatedModules": true}
```



For more information on these flags:

- `isolatedModules` 

- `declaration` , `emitDeclarationOnly`

# TypeScript 5.2

 

## `using` Declarations and Explicit Resource Management

TypeScript 5.2 adds support for the upcoming Explicit Resource Management feature in ECMAScript.
Let’s explore some of the motivations and understand what the feature brings us.

It’s common to need to do some sort of “clean-up” after creating an object.
For example, you might need to close network connections, delete temporary files, or just free up some memory.

Let’s imagine a function that creates a temporary file, reads and writes to it for various operations, and then closes and deletes it.



```id
tsimport * as fs from "fs";export function doSomeWork() {    const path = ".some_temp_file";    const file = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    // use file...    // Close the file and delete it.    fs.closeSync(file);    fs.unlinkSync(path);}
```



This is fine, but what happens if we need to perform an early exit?



```id
tsexport function doSomeWork() {    const path = ".some_temp_file";    const file = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    // use file...    if (someCondition()) {        // do some more work...        // Close the file and delete it.        fs.closeSync(file);        fs.unlinkSync(path);        return;    }    // Close the file and delete it.    fs.closeSync(file);    fs.unlinkSync(path);}
```



We’re starting to see some duplication of clean-up which can be easy to forget.
We’re also not guaranteed to close and delete the file if an error gets thrown.
This could be solved by wrapping this all in a `try`/`finally` block.



```id
tsexport function doSomeWork() {    const path = ".some_temp_file";    const file = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    try {        // use file...        if (someCondition()) {            // do some more work...            return;        }    }    finally {        // Close the file and delete it.        fs.closeSync(file);        fs.unlinkSync(path);    }}
```



While this is more robust, it’s added quite a bit of “noise” to our code.
There are also other foot-guns we can run into if we start adding more clean-up logic to our `finally` block — for example, exceptions preventing other resources from being disposed.
This is what the explicit resource management proposal aims to solve.
The key idea of the proposal is to support resource disposal — this clean-up work we’re trying to deal with — as a first class idea in JavaScript.

This starts by adding a new built-in `symbol` called `Symbol.dispose`, and we can create objects with methods named by `Symbol.dispose`.
For convenience, TypeScript defines a new global type called `Disposable` which describes these.



```id
tsclass TempFile implements Disposable {    #path: string;    #handle: number;    constructor(path: string) {        this.#path = path;        this.#handle = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    }    // other methods    [Symbol.dispose]() {        // Close the file and delete it.        fs.closeSync(this.#handle);        fs.unlinkSync(this.#path);    }}
```



Later on we can call those methods.



```id
tsexport function doSomeWork() {    const file = new TempFile(".some_temp_file");    try {        // ...    }    finally {        file[Symbol.dispose]();    }}
```



Moving the clean-up logic to `TempFile` itself doesn’t buy us much;
we’ve basically just moved all the clean-up work from the `finally` block into a method, and that’s always been possible.
But having a well-known “name” for this method means that JavaScript can build other features on top of it.

That brings us to the first star of the feature: `using` declarations!
`using` is a new keyword that lets us declare new fixed bindings, kind of like `const`.
The key difference is that variables declared with `using` get their `Symbol.dispose` method called at the end of the scope!

So we could simply have written our code like this:



```id
tsexport function doSomeWork() {    using file = new TempFile(".some_temp_file");    // use file...    if (someCondition()) {        // do some more work...        return;    }}
```



Check it out — no `try`/`finally` blocks!
At least, none that we see.
Functionally, that’s exactly what `using` declarations will do for us, but we don’t have to deal with that.

You might be familiar with `using` declarations in C# , `with` statements in Python , or `try`-with-resource declarations in Java .
These are all similar to JavaScript’s new `using` keyword, and provide a similar explicit way to perform a “tear-down” of an object at the end of a scope.

`using` declarations do this clean-up at the very end of their containing scope or right before an “early return” like a `return` or a `throw`n error.
They also dispose in a first-in-last-out order like a stack.



```id
tsfunction loggy(id: string): Disposable {    console.log(`Creating ${id}`);    return {        [Symbol.dispose]() {            console.log(`Disposing ${id}`);        }    }}function func() {    using a = loggy("a");    using b = loggy("b");    {        using c = loggy("c");        using d = loggy("d");    }    using e = loggy("e");    return;    // Unreachable.    // Never created, never disposed.    using f = loggy("f");}func();// Creating a// Creating b// Creating c// Creating d// Disposing d// Disposing c// Creating e// Disposing e// Disposing b// Disposing a
```



`using` declarations are supposed to be resilient to exceptions;
if an error is thrown, it’s rethrown after disposal.
On the other hand, the body of your function might execute as expected, but the `Symbol.dispose` might throw.
In that case, that exception is rethrown as well.

But what happens if both the logic before and during disposal throws an error?
For those cases, `SuppressedError` has been introduced as a new subtype of `Error`.
It features a `suppressed` property that holds the last-thrown error, and an `error` property for the most-recently thrown error.



```id
tsclass ErrorA extends Error {    name = "ErrorA";}class ErrorB extends Error {    name = "ErrorB";}function throwy(id: string) {    return {        [Symbol.dispose]() {            throw new ErrorA(`Error from ${id}`);        }    };}function func() {    using a = throwy("a");    throw new ErrorB("oops!")}try {    func();}catch (e: any) {    console.log(e.name); // SuppressedError    console.log(e.message); // An error was suppressed during disposal.    console.log(e.error.name); // ErrorA    console.log(e.error.message); // Error from a    console.log(e.suppressed.name); // ErrorB    console.log(e.suppressed.message); // oops!}
```



You might have noticed that we’re using synchronous methods in these examples.
However, lots of resource disposal involves asynchronous operations, and we need to wait for those to complete before we continue running any other code.

That’s why there is also a new `Symbol.asyncDispose`, and it brings us to the next star of the show — `await using` declarations.
These are similar to `using` declarations, but the key is that they look up whose disposal must be `await`ed.
They use a different method named by `Symbol.asyncDispose`, though they can operate on anything with a `Symbol.dispose` as well.
For convenience, TypeScript also introduces a global type called `AsyncDisposable` that describes any object with an asynchronous dispose method.



```id
tsasync function doWork() {    // Do fake work for half a second.    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));}function loggy(id: string): AsyncDisposable {    console.log(`Constructing ${id}`);    return {        async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {            console.log(`Disposing (async) ${id}`);            await doWork();        },    }}async function func() {    await using a = loggy("a");    await using b = loggy("b");    {        await using c = loggy("c");        await using d = loggy("d");    }    await using e = loggy("e");    return;    // Unreachable.    // Never created, never disposed.    await using f = loggy("f");}func();// Constructing a// Constructing b// Constructing c// Constructing d// Disposing (async) d// Disposing (async) c// Constructing e// Disposing (async) e// Disposing (async) b// Disposing (async) a
```



Defining types in terms of `Disposable` and `AsyncDisposable` can make your code much easier to work with if you expect others to do tear-down logic consistently.
In fact, lots of existing types exist in the wild which have a `dispose()` or `close()` method.
For example, the Visual Studio Code APIs even define their own `Disposable` interface .
APIs in the browser and in runtimes like Node.js, Deno, and Bun might also choose to use `Symbol.dispose` and `Symbol.asyncDispose` for objects which already have clean-up methods, like file handles, connections, and more.

Now maybe this all sounds great for libraries, but a little bit heavy-weight for your scenarios.
If you’re doing a lot of ad-hoc clean-up, creating a new type might introduce a lot of over-abstraction and questions about best-practices.
For example, take our `TempFile` example again.



```id
tsclass TempFile implements Disposable {    #path: string;    #handle: number;    constructor(path: string) {        this.#path = path;        this.#handle = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    }    // other methods    [Symbol.dispose]() {        // Close the file and delete it.        fs.closeSync(this.#handle);        fs.unlinkSync(this.#path);    }}export function doSomeWork() {    using file = new TempFile(".some_temp_file");    // use file...    if (someCondition()) {        // do some more work...        return;    }}
```



All we wanted was to remember to call two functions — but was this the best way to write it?
Should we be calling `openSync` in the constructor, create an `open()` method, or pass in the handle ourselves?
Should we expose a method for every possible operation we need to perform, or should we just make the properties public?

That brings us to the final stars of the feature: `DisposableStack` and `AsyncDisposableStack`.
These objects are useful for doing both one-off clean-up, along with arbitrary amounts of cleanup.
A `DisposableStack` is an object that has several methods for keeping track of `Disposable` objects, and can be given functions for doing arbitrary clean-up work.
We can also assign them to `using` variables because — get this — they’re also `Disposable` !
So here’s how we could’ve written the original example.



```id
tsfunction doSomeWork() {    const path = ".some_temp_file";    const file = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    using cleanup = new DisposableStack();    cleanup.defer(() => {        fs.closeSync(file);        fs.unlinkSync(path);    });    // use file...    if (someCondition()) {        // do some more work...        return;    }    // ...}
```



Here, the `defer()` method just takes a callback, and that callback will be run once `cleanup` is disposed of.
Typically, `defer` (and other `DisposableStack` methods like `use` and `adopt`)
should be called immediately after creating a resource.
As the name suggests, `DisposableStack` disposes of everything it keeps track of like a stack, in a first-in-last-out order, so `defer`ing immediately after creating a value helps avoid odd dependency issues.
`AsyncDisposableStack` works similarly, but can keep track of `async` functions and `AsyncDisposable`s, and is itself an `AsyncDisposable.`

The `defer` method is similar in many ways to the `defer` keyword in Go , Swift , Zig , Odin , and others, where the conventions should be similar.

Because this feature is so recent, most runtimes will not support it natively.
To use it, you will need runtime polyfills for the following:

 `Symbol.dispose`

- `Symbol.asyncDispose`

- `DisposableStack`

- `AsyncDisposableStack`

- `SuppressedError`

However, if all you’re interested in is `using` and `await using`, you should be able to get away with only polyfilling the built-in `symbol`s.
Something as simple as the following should work for most cases:



```id
tsSymbol.dispose ??= Symbol("Symbol.dispose");Symbol.asyncDispose ??= Symbol("Symbol.asyncDispose");
```



You will also need to set your compilation `target` to `es2022` or below, and configure your `lib` setting to either include `"esnext"` or `"esnext.disposable"`.



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "target": "es2022",        "lib": ["es2022", "esnext.disposable", "dom"]    }}
```



For more information on this feature, take a look at the work on GitHub !

## Decorator Metadata

TypeScript 5.2 implements an upcoming ECMAScript feature called decorator metadata .

The key idea of this feature is to make it easy for decorators to create and consume metadata on any class they’re used on or within.

Whenever decorator functions are used, they now have access to a new `metadata` property on their context object.
The `metadata` property just holds a simple object.
Since JavaScript lets us add properties arbitrarily, it can be used as a dictionary that is updated by each decorator.
Alternatively, since every `metadata` object will be identical for each decorated portion of a class, it can be used as a key into a `Map`.
After all decorators on or in a class get run, that object can be accessed on the class via `Symbol.metadata`.



```id
tsinterface Context {    name: string;    metadata: Record<PropertyKey, unknown>;}function setMetadata(_target: any, context: Context) {    context.metadata[context.name] = true;}class SomeClass {    @setMetadata    foo = 123;    @setMetadata    accessor bar = "hello!";    @setMetadata    baz() { }}const ourMetadata = SomeClass[Symbol.metadata];console.log(JSON.stringify(ourMetadata));// { "bar": true, "baz": true, "foo": true }
```



This can be useful in a number of different scenarios.
Metadata could possibly be attached for lots of uses like debugging, serialization, or performing dependency injection with decorators.
Since metadata objects are created per decorated class, frameworks can either privately use them as keys into a `Map` or `WeakMap`, or tack properties on as necessary.

For example, let’s say we wanted to use decorators to keep track of which properties and accessors are serializable when using `JSON.stringify` like so:



```id
tsimport { serialize, jsonify } from "./serializer";class Person {    firstName: string;    lastName: string;    @serialize    age: number    @serialize    get fullName() {        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;    }    toJSON() {        return jsonify(this)    }    constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string, age: number) {        // ...    }}
```



Here, the intent is that only `age` and `fullName` should be serialized because they are marked with the `@serialize` decorator.
We define a `toJSON` method for this purpose, but it just calls out to `jsonify` which uses the metadata that `@serialize` created.

Here’s an example of how the module `./serialize.ts` might be defined:



```id
tsconst serializables = Symbol();type Context =    | ClassAccessorDecoratorContext    | ClassGetterDecoratorContext    | ClassFieldDecoratorContext    ;export function serialize(_target: any, context: Context): void {    if (context.static || context.private) {        throw new Error("Can only serialize public instance members.")    }    if (typeof context.name === "symbol") {        throw new Error("Cannot serialize symbol-named properties.");    }    const propNames =        (context.metadata[serializables] as string[] | undefined) ??= [];    propNames.push(context.name);}export function jsonify(instance: object): string {    const metadata = instance.constructor[Symbol.metadata];    const propNames = metadata?.[serializables] as string[] | undefined;    if (!propNames) {        throw new Error("No members marked with @serialize.");    }    const pairStrings = propNames.map(key => {        const strKey = JSON.stringify(key);        const strValue = JSON.stringify((instance as any)[key]);        return `${strKey}: ${strValue}`;    });    return `{ ${pairStrings.join(", ")} }`;}
```



This module has a local `symbol` called `serializables` to store and retrieve the names of properties marked `@serializable`.
It stores a list of these property names on the metadata on each invocation of `@serializable`.
When `jsonify` is called, the list of properties is fetched off of the metadata and used to retrieve the actual values from the instance, eventually serializing those names and values.

Using a `symbol` technically makes this data accessible to others.
An alternative might be to use a `WeakMap` using the metadata object as a key.
This keeps data private and happens to use fewer type assertions in this case, but is otherwise similar.



```id
tsconst serializables = new WeakMap<object, string[]>();type Context =    | ClassAccessorDecoratorContext    | ClassGetterDecoratorContext    | ClassFieldDecoratorContext    ;export function serialize(_target: any, context: Context): void {    if (context.static || context.private) {        throw new Error("Can only serialize public instance members.")    }    if (typeof context.name !== "string") {        throw new Error("Can only serialize string properties.");    }    let propNames = serializables.get(context.metadata);    if (propNames === undefined) {        serializables.set(context.metadata, propNames = []);    }    propNames.push(context.name);}export function jsonify(instance: object): string {    const metadata = instance.constructor[Symbol.metadata];    const propNames = metadata && serializables.get(metadata);    if (!propNames) {        throw new Error("No members marked with @serialize.");    }    const pairStrings = propNames.map(key => {        const strKey = JSON.stringify(key);        const strValue = JSON.stringify((instance as any)[key]);        return `${strKey}: ${strValue}`;    });    return `{ ${pairStrings.join(", ")} }`;}
```



As a note, these implementations don’t handle subclassing and inheritance.
That’s left as an exercise to you (and you might find that it is easier in one version of the file than the other!).

Because this feature is still fresh, most runtimes will not support it natively.
To use it, you will need a polyfill for `Symbol.metadata`.
Something as simple as the following should work for most cases:



```id
tsSymbol.metadata ??= Symbol("Symbol.metadata");
```



You will also need to set your compilation `target` to `es2022` or below, and configure your `lib` setting to either include `"esnext"` or `"esnext.decorators"`.



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "target": "es2022",        "lib": ["es2022", "esnext.decorators", "dom"]    }}
```



We’d like to thank Oleksandr Tarasiuk for contributing the implementation of decorator metadata for TypeScript 5.2!

 

## Named and Anonymous Tuple Elements

Tuple types have supported optional labels or names for each element.



```id
tstype Pair<T> = [first: T, second: T];
```



These labels don’t change what you’re allowed to do with them — they’re solely to help with readability and tooling.

However, TypeScript previously had a rule that tuples could not mix and match between labeled and unlabeled elements.
In other words, either no element could have a label in a tuple, or all elements needed one.



```id
ts// ✅ fine - no labelstype Pair1<T> = [T, T];// ✅ fine - all fully labeledtype Pair2<T> = [first: T, second: T];// ❌ previously an errortype Pair3<T> = [first: T, T];//                         ~// Tuple members must all have names// or all not have names.
```



This could be annoying for rest elements where we’d be forced to just add a label like `rest` or `tail`.



```id
ts// ❌ previously an errortype TwoOrMore_A<T> = [first: T, second: T, ...T[]];//                                          ~~~~~~// Tuple members must all have names// or all not have names.// ✅type TwoOrMore_B<T> = [first: T, second: T, rest: ...T[]];
```



It also meant that this restriction had to be enforced internally in the type system, meaning TypeScript would lose labels.



```id
tstype HasLabels = [a: string, b: string];type HasNoLabels = [number, number];type Merged = [...HasNoLabels, ...HasLabels];//   ^ [number, number, string, string]////     'a' and 'b' were lost in 'Merged'
```



In TypeScript 5.2, the all-or-nothing restriction on tuple labels has been lifted.
The language can now also preserve labels when spreading into an unlabeled tuple.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Josh Goldberg and Mateusz Burzyński who collaborated to lift this restriction .

## Easier Method Usage for Unions of Arrays

In previous versions of TypeScript, calling a method on a union of arrays could end in pain.



```id
tsdeclare let array: string[] | number[];array.filter(x => !!x);//    ~~~~~~ error!// This expression is not callable.//   Each member of the union type '...' has signatures,//   but none of those signatures are compatible//   with each other.
```



In this example, TypeScript would try to see if each version of `filter` is compatible across `string[]` and `number[]`.
Without a coherent strategy, TypeScript threw its hands in the air and said “I can’t make it work”.

In TypeScript 5.2, before giving up in these cases, unions of arrays are treated as a special case.
A new array type is constructed out of each member’s element type, and then the method is invoked on that.

Taking the above example, `string[] | number[]` is transformed into `(string | number)[]` (or `Array `), and `filter` is invoked on that type.
There is a slight caveat which is that `filter` will produce an `Array ` instead of a `string[] | number[]`;
but for a freshly produced value there is less risk of something “going wrong”.

This means lots of methods like `filter`, `find`, `some`, `every`, and `reduce` should all be invokable on unions of arrays in cases where they were not previously.

You can read up more details on the implementing pull request .

## Type-Only Import Paths with TypeScript Implementation File Extensions

TypeScript now allows both declaration and implementation file extensions to be included in type-only import paths, regardless of whether `allowImportingTsExtensions` is enabled.

This means that you can now write `import type` statements that use `.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`, and `.tsx` file extensions.



```id
tsimport type { JustAType } from "./justTypes.ts";export function f(param: JustAType) {    // ...}
```



It also means that `import()` types, which can be used in both TypeScript and JavaScript with JSDoc, can use those file extensions.



```id
js/** * @param {import("./justTypes.ts").JustAType} param */export function f(param) {    // ...}
```



For more information, see the change here .

## Comma Completions for Object Members

It can be easy to forget to add a comma when adding a new property to an object.
Previously, if you forgot a comma and requested auto-completion, TypeScript would confusingly give poor unrelated completion results.

TypeScript 5.2 now gracefully provides object member completions when you’re missing a comma.
But to just skip past hitting you with a syntax error, it will also auto-insert the missing comma.

 

For more information, see the implementation here .

## Inline Variable Refactoring

TypeScript 5.2 now has a refactoring to inline the contents of a variable to all usage sites.

 .

Using the “inline variable” refactoring will eliminate the variable and replace all the variable’s usages with its initializer.
Note that this may cause that initializer’s side-effects to run at a different time, and as many times as the variable has been used.

For more details, see the implementing pull request .

 

## Optimized Checks for Ongoing Type Compatibility

Because TypeScript is a structural type system, types occasionally need to be compared in a member-wise fashion;
however, recursive types add some issues here.
For example:



```id
tsinterface A {    value: A;    other: string;}interface B {    value: B;    other: number;}
```



When checking whether the type `A` is compatible with the type `B`, TypeScript will end up checking whether the types of `value` in `A` and `B` are respectively compatible.
At this point, the type system needs to stop checking any further and proceed to check other members.
To do this, the type system has to track when any two types are already being related.

Previously TypeScript already kept a stack of type pairs, and iterated through that to determine whether those types are being related.
When this stack is shallow that’s not a problem; but when the stack isn’t shallow, that, uh, is a problem .

In TypeScript 5.3, a simple `Set` helps track this information.
This reduced the time spent on a reported test case that used the drizzle library by over 33%!



```
Benchmark 1: old  Time (mean ± σ):      3.115 s ±  0.067 s    [User: 4.403 s, System: 0.124 s]  Range (min … max):    3.018 s …  3.196 s    10 runs Benchmark 2: new  Time (mean ± σ):      2.072 s ±  0.050 s    [User: 3.355 s, System: 0.135 s]  Range (min … max):    1.985 s …  2.150 s    10 runs Summary  'new' ran    1.50 ± 0.05 times faster than 'old'
```

## Breaking Changes and Correctness Fixes

TypeScript strives not to unnecessarily introduce breaks;
however, occasionally we must make corrections and improvements so that code can be better-analyzed.

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on your codebase.
For more information, see the DOM updates for TypeScript 5.2 .

### `labeledElementDeclarations` May Hold `undefined` Elements

In order to support a mixture of labeled and unlabeled elements , TypeScript’s API has changed slightly.
The `labeledElementDeclarations` property of `TupleType` may hold `undefined` for at each position where an element is unlabeled.



```id
diff  interface TupleType {-     labeledElementDeclarations?: readonly (NamedTupleMember | ParameterDeclaration)[];+     labeledElementDeclarations?: readonly (NamedTupleMember | ParameterDeclaration | undefined)[];  }
```



### `module` and `moduleResolution` Must Match Under Recent Node.js settings

The `--module` and `--moduleResolution` options each support a `node16` and `nodenext` setting.
These are effectively “modern Node.js” settings that should be used on any recent Node.js project.
What we’ve found is that when these two options don’t agree on whether they are using Node.js-related settings, projects are effectively misconfigured.

In TypeScript 5.2, when using `node16` or `nodenext` for either of the `--module` and `--moduleResolution` options, TypeScript now requires the other to have a similar Node.js-related setting.
In cases where the settings diverge, you’ll likely get an error message like either



```
Option 'moduleResolution' must be set to 'NodeNext' (or left unspecified) when option 'module' is set to 'NodeNext'.
```



or



```
Option 'module' must be set to 'Node16' when option 'moduleResolution' is set to 'Node16'.
```



So for example `--module esnext --moduleResolution node16` will be rejected — but you may be better off just using `--module nodenext` alone, or `--module esnext --moduleResolution bundler`.

For more information, see the change here .

### Consistent Export Checking for Merged Symbols

When two declarations merge, they must agree on whether they are both exported.
Due to a bug, TypeScript missed specific cases in ambient contexts, like in declaration files or `declare module` blocks.
For example, it would not issue an error on a case like the following, where `replaceInFile` is declared once as an exported function, and one as an un-exported namespace.



```id
tsdeclare module 'replace-in-file' {    export function replaceInFile(config: unknown): Promise<unknown[]>;    export {};    namespace replaceInFile {        export function sync(config: unknown): unknown[];  }}
```



In an ambient module, adding an `export { ... }` or a similar construct like `export default ...` implicitly changes whether all declarations are automatically exported.
TypeScript now recognizes these unfortunately confusing semantics more consistently, and issues an error on the fact that all declarations of `replaceInFile` need to agree in their modifiers, and will issue the following error:



```
Individual declarations in merged declaration 'replaceInFile' must be all exported or all local.
```

# TypeScript 5.9

 

## Minimal and Updated `tsc --init`

For a while, the TypeScript compiler has supported an `--init` flag that can create a `tsconfig.json` within the current directory.
In the last few years, running `tsc --init` created a very “full” `tsconfig.json`, filled with commented-out settings and their descriptions.
We designed this with the intent of making options discoverable and easy to toggle.

However, given external feedback (and our own experience), we found it’s common to immediately delete most of the contents of these new `tsconfig.json` files.
When users want to discover new options, we find they rely on auto-complete from their editor, or navigate to the tsconfig reference on our website (which the generated `tsconfig.json` links to!).
What each setting does is also documented on that same page, and can be seen via editor hovers/tooltips/quick info.
While surfacing some commented-out settings might be helpful, the generated `tsconfig.json` was often considered overkill.

We also felt that it was time that `tsc --init` initialized with a few more prescriptive settings than we already enable.
We looked at some common pain points and papercuts users have when they create a new TypeScript project.
For example, most users write in modules (not global scripts), and `--moduleDetection` can force TypeScript to treat every implementation file as a module.
Developers also often want to use the latest ECMAScript features directly in their runtime, so `--target` can typically be set to `esnext`.
JSX users often find that going back to set `--jsx` is needless friction, and its options are slightly confusing.
And often, projects end up loading more declaration files from `node_modules/@types` than TypeScript actually needs; but specifying an empty `types` array can help limit this.

In TypeScript 5.9, a plain `tsc --init` with no other flags will generate the following `tsconfig.json`:



```id
json{  // Visit https://aka.ms/tsconfig to read more about this file  "compilerOptions": {    // File Layout    // "rootDir": "./src",    // "outDir": "./dist",    // Environment Settings    // See also https://aka.ms/tsconfig_modules    "module": "nodenext",    "target": "esnext",    "types": [],    // For nodejs:    // "lib": ["esnext"],    // "types": ["node"],    // and npm install -D @types/node    // Other Outputs    "sourceMap": true,    "declaration": true,    "declarationMap": true,    // Stricter Typechecking Options    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,    // Style Options    // "noImplicitReturns": true,    // "noImplicitOverride": true,    // "noUnusedLocals": true,    // "noUnusedParameters": true,    // "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,    // "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,    // Recommended Options    "strict": true,    "jsx": "react-jsx",    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,    "isolatedModules": true,    "noUncheckedSideEffectImports": true,    "moduleDetection": "force",    "skipLibCheck": true,  }}
```



For more details, see the implementing pull request and discussion issue .

## Support for `import defer`

TypeScript 5.9 introduces support for ECMAScript’s deferred module evaluation proposal using the new `import defer` syntax.
This feature allows you to import a module without immediately executing the module and its dependencies, providing better control over when work and side-effects occur.

The syntax only permits namespace imports:



```id
tsimport defer * as feature from "./some-feature.js";
```



The key benefit of `import defer` is that the module is only evaluated when one of its exports is first accessed.
Consider this example:



```id
ts// ./some-feature.tsinitializationWithSideEffects();function initializationWithSideEffects() {  // ...  specialConstant = 42;  console.log("Side effects have occurred!");}export let specialConstant: number;
```



When using `import defer`, the `initializationWithSideEffects()` function will not be called until you actually access a property of the imported namespace:



```id
tsimport defer * as feature from "./some-feature.js";// No side effects have occurred yet// ...// As soon as `specialConstant` is accessed, the contents of the `feature`// module are run and side effects have taken place.console.log(feature.specialConstant); // 42
```



Because evaluation of the module is deferred until you access a member off of the module, you cannot use named imports or default imports with `import defer`:



```id
ts// ❌ Not allowedimport defer { doSomething } from "some-module";// ❌ Not allowed  import defer defaultExport from "some-module";// ✅ Only this syntax is supportedimport defer * as feature from "some-module";
```



Note that when you write `import defer`, the module and its dependencies are fully loaded and ready for execution.
That means that the module will need to exist, and will be loaded from the file system or a network resource.
The key difference between a regular `import` and `import defer` is that the execution of statements and declarations is deferred until you access a property of the imported namespace.

This feature is particularly useful for conditionally loading modules with expensive or platform-specific initialization. It can also improve startup performance by deferring module evaluation for app features until they are actually needed.

Note that `import defer` is not transformed or “downleveled” at all by TypeScript.
It is intended to be used in runtimes that support the feature natively, or by tools such as bundlers that can apply the appropriate transformation.
That means that `import defer` will only work under the `--module` modes `preserve` and `esnext`.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Nicolò Ribaudo who championed the proposal in TC39 and also provided the implementation for this feature .

## Support for `--module node20`

TypeScript provides several `node*` options for the `--module` and `--moduleResolution` settings.
Most recently, `--module nodenext` has supported the ability to `require()` ECMAScript modules from CommonJS modules, and correctly rejects import assertions (in favor of the standards-bound import attributes ).

TypeScript 5.9 brings a stable option for these settings called `node20`, intended to model the behavior of Node.js v20.
This option is unlikely to have new behaviors in the future, unlike `--module nodenext` or `--moduleResolution nodenext`.
Also unlike `nodenext`, specifying `--module node20` will imply `--target es2023` unless otherwise configured.
`--module nodenext`, on the other hand, implies the floating `--target esnext`.

For more information, take a look at the implementation here .

## Summary Descriptions in DOM APIs

Previously, many of the DOM APIs in TypeScript only linked to the MDN documentation for the API.
These links were useful, but they didn’t provide a quick summary of what the API does.
Thanks to a few changes from Adam Naji , TypeScript now includes summary descriptions for many DOM APIs based on the MDN documentation.
You can see more of these changes here and here .

## Expandable Hovers (Preview)

 Quick Info (also called “editor tooltips” and “hovers”) can be very useful for peeking at variables to see their types, or at type aliases to see what they actually refer to.
Still, it’s common for people to want to go deeper and get details from whatever’s displayed within the quick info tooltip.
For example, if we hover our mouse over the parameter `options` in the following example:



```id
tsexport function drawButton(options: Options): void
```



We’re left with `(parameter) options: Options`.

 

Do we really need to jump to the definition of the type `Options` just to see what members this value has?

Previously, that was actually the case.
To help here, TypeScript 5.9 is now previewing a feature called expandable hovers , or “quick info verbosity”.
If you use an editor like VS Code, you’ll now see a `+` and `-` button on the left of these hover tooltips.
Clicking on the `+` button will expand out types more deeply, while clicking on the `-` button will collapse to the last view.

 

This feature is currently in preview, and we are seeking feedback for both TypeScript and our partners on Visual Studio Code.
For more details, see the PR for this feature here .

## Configurable Maximum Hover Length

Occasionally, quick info tooltips can become so long that TypeScript will truncate them to make them more readable.
The downside here is that often the most important information will be omitted from the hover tooltip, which can be frustrating.
To help with this, TypeScript 5.9’s language server supports a configurable hover length, which can be configured in VS Code via the `js/ts.hover.maximumLength` setting.

Additionally, the new default hover length is substantially larger than the previous default.
This means that in TypeScript 5.9, you should see more information in your hover tooltips by default.
For more details, see the PR for this feature here and the corresponding change to Visual Studio Code here .

## Optimizations

### Cache Instantiations on Mappers

When TypeScript replaces type parameters with specific type arguments, it can end up instantiating many of the same intermediate types over and over again.
In complex libraries like Zod and tRPC, this could lead to both performance issues and errors reported around excessive type instantiation depth.
Thanks to a change from Mateusz Burzyński , TypeScript 5.9 is able to cache many intermediate instantiations when work has already begun on a specific type instantiation.
This in turn avoids lots of unnecessary work and allocations.

### Avoiding Closure Creation in `fileOrDirectoryExistsUsingSource`

In JavaScript, a function expression will typically allocate a new function object, even if the wrapper function is just passing through arguments to another function with no captured variables.
In code paths around file existence checks, Vincent Bailly found examples of these pass-through function calls, even though the underlying functions only took single arguments.
Given the number of existence checks that could take place in larger projects, he cited a speed-up of around 11%.
 See more on this change here .

## Notable Behavioral Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.

Additionally, one notable change is that `ArrayBuffer` has been changed in such a way that it is no longer a supertype of several different `TypedArray` types.
This also includes subtypes of `UInt8Array`, such as `Buffer` from Node.js.
As a result, you’ll see new error messages such as:



```
error TS2345: Argument of type 'ArrayBufferLike' is not assignable to parameter of type 'BufferSource'.error TS2322: Type 'ArrayBufferLike' is not assignable to type 'ArrayBuffer'.error TS2322: Type 'Buffer' is not assignable to type 'Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'.error TS2322: Type 'Buffer' is not assignable to type 'ArrayBuffer'.error TS2345: Argument of type 'Buffer' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'.
```



If you encounter issues with `Buffer`, you may first want to check that you are using the latest version of the `@types/node` package.
This might include running



```
npm update @types/node --save-dev
```



Much of the time, the solution is to specify a more specific underlying buffer type instead of using the default `ArrayBufferLike` (i.e. explicitly writing out `Uint8Array ` rather than a plain `Uint8Array`).
In instances where some `TypedArray` (like `Uint8Array`) is passed to a function expecting an `ArrayBuffer` or `SharedArrayBuffer`, you can also try accessing the `buffer` property of that `TypedArray` like in the following example:



```id
diff  let data = new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);- someFunc(data)+ someFunc(data.buffer)
```



## Type Argument Inference Changes

In an effort to fix “leaks” of type variables during inference, TypeScript 5.9 may introduce changes in types and possibly new errors in some codebases.
These are hard to predict, but can often be fixed by adding type arguments to generic functions calls.

# TypeScript 5.1

 

## Easier Implicit Returns for `undefined`-Returning Functions

In JavaScript, if a function finishes running without hitting a `return`, it returns the value `undefined`.



```id
tsfunction foo() {    // no return}// x = undefinedlet x = foo();
```



However, in previous versions of TypeScript, the only functions that could have absolutely no return statements were `void`- and `any`-returning functions.
That meant that even if you explicitly said “this function returns `undefined`” you were forced to have at least one return statement.



```id
ts// ✅ fine - we inferred that 'f1' returns 'void'function f1() {    // no returns}// ✅ fine - 'void' doesn't need a return statementfunction f2(): void {    // no returns}// ✅ fine - 'any' doesn't need a return statementfunction f3(): any {    // no returns}// ❌ error!// A function whose declared type is neither 'void' nor 'any' must return a value.function f4(): undefined {    // no returns}
```



This could be a pain if some API expected a function returning `undefined` - you would need to have either at least one explicit return of `undefined` or a `return` statement and an explicit annotation.



```id
tsdeclare function takesFunction(f: () => undefined): undefined;// ❌ error!// Argument of type '() => void' is not assignable to parameter of type '() => undefined'.takesFunction(() => {    // no returns});// ❌ error!// A function whose declared type is neither 'void' nor 'any' must return a value.takesFunction((): undefined => {    // no returns});// ❌ error!// Argument of type '() => void' is not assignable to parameter of type '() => undefined'.takesFunction(() => {    return;});// ✅ workstakesFunction(() => {    return undefined;});// ✅ workstakesFunction((): undefined => {    return;});
```



This behavior was frustrating and confusing, especially when calling functions outside of one’s control.
Understanding the interplay between inferring `void` over `undefined`, whether an `undefined`-returning function needs a `return` statement, etc. seems like a distraction.

First, TypeScript 5.1 now allows `undefined`-returning functions to have no return statement.



```id
ts// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1!function f4(): undefined {    // no returns}// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1!takesFunction((): undefined => {    // no returns});
```



Second, if a function has no return expressions and is being passed to something expecting a function that returns `undefined`, TypeScript infers `undefined` for that function’s return type.



```id
ts// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1!takesFunction(function f() {    //                 ^ return type is undefined    // no returns});// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1!takesFunction(function f() {    //                 ^ return type is undefined    return;});
```



To address another similar pain-point, under TypeScript’s `--noImplicitReturns` option, functions returning only `undefined` now have a similar exception to `void`, in that not every single code path must end in an explicit `return`.



```id
ts// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1 under '--noImplicitReturns'!function f(): undefined {    if (Math.random()) {        // do some stuff...        return;    }}
```



For more information, you can read up on the original issue and the implementing pull request .

## Unrelated Types for Getters and Setters

TypeScript 4.3 made it possible to say that a `get` and `set` accessor pair might specify two different types.



```id
tsinterface Serializer {    set value(v: string | number | boolean);    get value(): string;}declare let box: Serializer;// Allows writing a 'boolean'box.value = true;// Comes out as a 'string'console.log(box.value.toUpperCase());
```



Initially we required that the `get` type had to be a subtype of the `set` type.
This meant that writing



```id
tsbox.value = box.value;
```



would always be valid.

However, there are plenty of existing and proposed APIs that have completely unrelated types between their getters and setters.
For example, consider one of the most common examples - the `style` property in the DOM and `CSSStyleRule` API.
Every style rule has a `style` property that is a `CSSStyleDeclaration` ;
however, if you try to write to that property, it will only work correctly with a string!

TypeScript 5.1 now allows completely unrelated types for `get` and `set` accessor properties, provided that they have explicit type annotations.
And while this version of TypeScript does not yet change the types for these built-in interfaces, `CSSStyleRule` can now be defined in the following way:



```id
tsinterface CSSStyleRule {    // ...    /** Always reads as a `CSSStyleDeclaration` */    get style(): CSSStyleDeclaration;    /** Can only write a `string` here. */    set style(newValue: string);    // ...}
```



This also allows other patterns like requiring `set` accessors to accept only “valid” data, but specifying that `get` accessors may return `undefined` if some underlying state hasn’t been initialized yet.



```id
tsclass SafeBox {    #value: string | undefined;    // Only accepts strings!    set value(newValue: string) {    }    // Must check for 'undefined'!    get value(): string | undefined {        return this.#value;    }}
```



In fact, this is similar to how optional properties are checked under `--exactOptionalProperties`.

You can read up more on the implementing pull request .

## Decoupled Type-Checking Between JSX Elements and JSX Tag Types

One pain point TypeScript had with JSX was its requirements on the type of every JSX element’s tag.

For context, a JSX element is either of the following:



```id
tsx// A self-closing JSX tag<Foo />// A regular element with an opening/closing tag<Bar></Bar>
```



When type-checking ` ` or ` `, TypeScript always looks up a namespace called `JSX` and fetches a type out of it called `Element` - or more directly, it looks up `JSX.Element`.

But to check whether `Foo` or `Bar` themselves were valid to use as tag names, TypeScript would roughly just grab the types returned or constructed by `Foo` or `Bar` and check for compatibility with `JSX.Element` (or another type called `JSX.ElementClass` if the type is constructable).

The limitations here meant that components could not be used if they returned or “rendered” a more broad type than just `JSX.Element`.
For example, a JSX library might be fine with a component returning `string`s or `Promise`s.

As a more concrete example, React is considering adding limited support for components that return `Promise`s , but existing versions of TypeScript cannot express that without someone drastically loosening the type of `JSX.Element`.



```id
tsximport * as React from "react";async function Foo() {    return <div></div>;}let element = <Foo />;//             ~~~// 'Foo' cannot be used as a JSX component.//   Its return type 'Promise<Element>' is not a valid JSX element.
```



To provide libraries with a way to express this, TypeScript 5.1 now looks up a type called `JSX.ElementType`.
`ElementType` specifies precisely what is valid to use as a tag in a JSX element.
So it might be typed today as something like



```id
tsxnamespace JSX {    export type ElementType =        // All the valid lowercase tags        keyof IntrinsicAttributes        // Function components        (props: any) => Element        // Class components        new (props: any) => ElementClass;    export interface IntrinsicAttributes extends /*...*/ {}    export type Element = /*...*/;    export type ElementClass = /*...*/;}
```



We’d like to extend our thanks to Sebastian Silbermann who contributed this change !

## Namespaced JSX Attributes

TypeScript now supports namespaced attribute names when using JSX.



```id
tsximport * as React from "react";// Both of these are equivalent:const x = <Foo a:b="hello" />;const y = <Foo a : b="hello" />;interface FooProps {    "a:b": string;}function Foo(props: FooProps) {    return <div>{props["a:b"]}</div>;}
```



Namespaced tag names are looked up in a similar way on `JSX.IntrinsicAttributes` when the first segment of the name is a lowercase name.



```id
tsx// In some library's code or in an augmentation of that library:namespace JSX {    interface IntrinsicElements {        ["a:b"]: { prop: string };    }}// In our code:let x = <a:b prop="hello!" />;
```

## `typeRoots` Are Consulted In Module Resolution

When TypeScript’s specified module lookup strategy is unable to resolve a path, it will now resolve packages relative to the specified `typeRoots`.

See this pull request for more details.

## Move Declarations to Existing Files

In addition to moving declarations to new files, TypeScript now ships a preview feature for moving declarations to existing files as well.
You can try this functionality out in a recent version of Visual Studio Code.

 

Keep in mind that this feature is currently in preview, and we are seeking further feedback on it.

 https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/53542 

## Linked Cursors for JSX Tags

TypeScript now supports linked editing for JSX tag names.
Linked editing (occasionally called “mirrored cursors”) allows an editor to edit multiple locations at the same time automatically.

 

This new feature should work in both TypeScript and JavaScript files, and can be enabled in Visual Studio Code Insiders.
In Visual Studio Code, you can either edit the `Editor: Linked Editing` option in the Settings UI:

 

or configure `editor.linkedEditing` in your JSON settings file:



```id
jsonc{    // ...    "editor.linkedEditing": true,}
```



This feature will also be supported by Visual Studio 17.7 Preview 1.

You can take a look at our implementation of linked editing here!

## Snippet Completions for `@param` JSDoc Tags

TypeScript now provides snippet completions when typing out a `@param` tag in both TypeScript and JavaScript files.
This can help cut down on some typing and jumping around text as you document your code or add JSDoc types in JavaScript.

 

You can check out how this new feature was implemented on GitHub .

## Optimizations

### Avoiding Unnecessary Type Instantiation

TypeScript 5.1 now avoids performing type instantiation within object types that are known not to contain references to outer type parameters.
This has the potential to cut down on many unnecessary computations, and reduced the type-checking time of material-ui’s docs directory by over 50%.

You can see the changes involved for this change on GitHub .

### Negative Case Checks for Union Literals

When checking if a source type is part of a union type, TypeScript will first do a fast look-up using an internal type identifier for that source.
If that look-up fails, then TypeScript checks for compatibility against every type within the union.

When relating a literal type to a union of purely literal types, TypeScript can now avoid that full walk against every other type in the union.
This assumption is safe because TypeScript always interns/caches literal types - though there are some edge cases to handle relating to “fresh” literal types.

 This optimization was able to reduce the type-checking time of the code in this issue from about 45 seconds to about 0.4 seconds.

### Reduced Calls into Scanner for JSDoc Parsing

When older versions of TypeScript parsed out a JSDoc comment, they would use the scanner/tokenizer to break the comment into fine-grained tokens and piece the contents back together.
This could be helpful for normalizing comment text, so that multiple spaces would just collapse into one;
but it was extremely “chatty” and meant the parser and scanner would jump back and forth very often, adding overhead to JSDoc parsing.

TypeScript 5.1 has moved more logic around breaking down JSDoc comments into the scanner/tokenizer.
The scanner now returns larger chunks of content directly to the parser to do as it needs.

 These changes have brought down the parse time of several 10Mb mostly-prose-comment JavaScript files by about half.
For a more realistic example, our performance suite’s snapshot of xstate dropped about 300ms of parse time, making it faster to load and analyze.

## Breaking Changes

### ES2020 and Node.js 14.17 as Minimum Runtime Requirements

TypeScript 5.1 now ships JavaScript functionality that was introduced in ECMAScript 2020.
As a result, at minimum TypeScript must be run in a reasonably modern runtime.
For most users, this means TypeScript now only runs on Node.js 14.17 and later.

If you try running TypeScript 5.1 under an older version of Node.js such as Node 10 or 12, you may see an error like the following from running either `tsc.js` or `tsserver.js`:



```
node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.js:2406  for (let i = startIndex ?? 0; i < array.length; i++) {                           ^ SyntaxError: Unexpected token '?'    at wrapSafe (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:915:16)    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:963:27)    at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1027:10)    at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:863:32)    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:708:14)    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (internal/modules/run_main.js:60:12)    at internal/main/run_main_module.js:17:47
```



Additionally, if you try installing TypeScript you’ll get something like the following error messages from npm:



```
npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {npm WARN EBADENGINE   package: 'typescript@5.1.1-rc',npm WARN EBADENGINE   required: { node: '>=14.17' },npm WARN EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v12.22.12', npm: '8.19.2' }npm WARN EBADENGINE }
```



from Yarn:



```
error typescript@5.1.1-rc: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=14.17". Got "12.22.12"error Found incompatible module.
```


 

 See more information around this change here .

### Explicit `typeRoots` Disables Upward Walks for `node_modules/@types`

Previously, when the `typeRoots` option was specified in a `tsconfig.json` but resolution to any `typeRoots` directories had failed, TypeScript would still continue walking up parent directories, trying to resolve packages within each parent’s `node_modules/@types` folder.

This behavior could prompt excessive look-ups and has been disabled in TypeScript 5.1.
As a result, you may begin to see errors like the following based on entries in your `tsconfig.json`’s `types` option or `/// ` directives



```
error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'node'.error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'mocha'.error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'jasmine'.error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'chai-http'.error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'webpack-env"'.
```



The solution is typically to add specific entries for `node_modules/@types` to your `typeRoots`:



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "types": [            "node",            "mocha"        ],        "typeRoots": [            // Keep whatever you had around before.            "./some-custom-types/",            // You might need your local 'node_modules/@types'.            "./node_modules/@types",            // You might also need to specify a shared 'node_modules/@types'            // if you're using a "monorepo" layout.            "../../node_modules/@types",        ]    }}
```

# TypeScript 5.8

 

## Granular Checks for Branches in Return Expressions

Consider some code like the following:



```id
tsdeclare const untypedCache: Map<any, any>;function getUrlObject(urlString: string): URL {    return untypedCache.has(urlString) ?        untypedCache.get(urlString) :        urlString;}
```



The intent of this code is to retrieve a URL object from a cache if it exists, or to create a new URL object if it doesn’t.
However, there’s a bug: we forgot to actually construct a new URL object with the input.
Unfortunately, TypeScript generally didn’t catch this sort of bug.

When TypeScript checks conditional expressions like `cond ? trueBranch : falseBranch`, its type is treated as a union of the types of the two branches.
In other words, it gets the type of `trueBranch` and `falseBranch`, and combines them into a union type.
In this case, the type of `untypedCache.get(urlString)` is `any`, and the type of `urlString` is `string`.
This is where things go wrong because `any` is so infectious in how it interacts with other types.
The union `any | string` is simplified to `any`, so by the time TypeScript starts checking whether the expression in our `return` statement is compatible with the expected return type of `URL`, the type system has lost any information that would have caught the bug in this code.

In TypeScript 5.8, the type system special-cases conditional expressions directly inside `return` statements.
Each branch of the conditional is checked against the declared return type of the containing functions (if one exists), so the type system can catch the bug in the example above.



```id
tsdeclare const untypedCache: Map<any, any>;function getUrlObject(urlString: string): URL {    return untypedCache.has(urlString) ?        untypedCache.get(urlString) :        urlString;    //  ~~~~~~~~~    // error! Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'URL'.}
```



This change was made within this pull request , as part of a broader set of future improvements for TypeScript.

## Support for `require()` of ECMAScript Modules in `--module nodenext`

For years, Node.js supported ECMAScript modules (ESM) alongside CommonJS modules.
Unfortunately, the interoperability between the two had some challenges.

 ESM files could `import` CommonJS files

- CommonJS files could not `require()` ESM files

In other words, consuming CommonJS files from ESM files was possible, but not the other way around.
This introduced many challenges for library authors who wanted to provide ESM support.
These library authors would either have to break compatibility with CommonJS users, “dual-publish” their libraries (providing separate entry-points for ESM and CommonJS), or just stay on CommonJS indefinitely.
While dual-publishing might sound like a good middle-ground, it is a complex and error-prone process that also roughly doubles the amount of code within a package.

Node.js 22 relaxes some of these restrictions and permits `require("esm")` calls from CommonJS modules to ECMAScript modules.
Node.js still does not permit `require()` on ESM files that contain a top-level `await`, but most other ESM files are now consumable from CommonJS files.
This presents a major opportunity for library authors to provide ESM support without having to dual-publish their libraries.

TypeScript 5.8 supports this behavior under the `--module nodenext` flag.
When `--module nodenext` is enabled, TypeScript will avoid issuing errors on these `require()` calls to ESM files.

Because this feature may be back-ported to older versions of Node.js, there is currently no stable `--module nodeXXXX` option that enables this behavior;
however, we predict future versions of TypeScript may be able to stabilize the feature under `node20`.
In the meantime, we encourage users of Node.js 22 and newer to use `--module nodenext`, while library authors and users of older Node.js versions should remain on `--module node16` (or make the minor update to `--module node18` ).

For more information, see our support for require(“esm”) here .

## `--module node18`

TypeScript 5.8 introduces a stable `--module node18` flag.
For users who are fixed on using Node.js 18, this flag provides a stable point of reference that does not incorporate certain behaviors that are in `--module nodenext`.
Specifically:

- `require()` of ECMAScript modules is disallowed under `node18`, but allowed under `nodenext`

- import assertions (deprecated in favor of import attributes) are allowed under `node18`, but are disallowed under `nodenext`

See more at both the `--module node18` pull request and changes made to `--module nodenext` .

## The `--erasableSyntaxOnly` Option

Recently, Node.js 23.6 unflagged experimental support for running TypeScript files directly ;
however, only certain constructs are supported under this mode.
Node.js has unflagged a mode called `--experimental-strip-types` which requires that any TypeScript-specific syntax cannot have runtime semantics.
Phrased differently, it must be possible to easily erase or “strip out” any TypeScript-specific syntax from a file, leaving behind a valid JavaScript file.

That means constructs like the following are not supported:

- `enum` declarations

- `namespace`s and `module`s with runtime code

- parameter properties in classes

- Non-ECMAScript `import =` and `export =` assignments

Here are some examples of what does not work:



```id
ts// ❌ error: An `import ... = require(...)` aliasimport foo = require("foo");// ❌ error: A namespace with runtime code.namespace container {}// ❌ error: An `import =` aliasimport Bar = container.Bar;class Point {    // ❌ error: Parameter properties    constructor(public x: number, public y: number) { }}// ❌ error: An `export =` assignment.export = Point;// ❌ error: An enum declaration.enum Direction {    Up,    Down,    Left,    Right,}
```



Similar tools like ts-blank-space or Amaro (the underlying library for type-stripping in Node.js) have the same limitations.
These tools will provide helpful error messages if they encounter code that doesn’t meet these requirements, but you still won’t find out your code doesn’t work until you actually try to run it.

That’s why TypeScript 5.8 introduces the `--erasableSyntaxOnly` flag.
When this flag is enabled, TypeScript will error on most TypeScript-specific constructs that have runtime behavior.



```id
tsclass C {    constructor(public x: number) { }    //          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    // error! This syntax is not allowed when 'erasableSyntaxOnly' is enabled.    }}
```



Typically, you will want to combine this flag with the `--verbatimModuleSyntax`, which ensures that a module contains the appropriate import syntax, and that import elision does not take place.

For more information, see the implementation here .

## The `--libReplacement` Flag

In TypeScript 4.5, we introduced the possibility of substituting the default `lib` files with custom ones.
This was based on the possibility of resolving a library file from packages named `@typescript/lib-*`.
For example, you could lock your `dom` libraries onto a specific version of the `@types/web` package with the following `package.json`:



```id
json{    "devDependencies": {       "@typescript/lib-dom": "npm:@types/web@0.0.199"     }}
```



When installed, a package called `@typescript/lib-dom` should exist, and TypeScript will currently always look it up when `dom` is implied by your settings.

This is a powerful feature, but it also incurs a bit of extra work.
Even if you’re not using this feature, TypeScript always performs this lookup, and has to watch for changes in `node_modules` in case a `lib`-replacement package begins to exist.

TypeScript 5.8 introduces the `--libReplacement` flag, which allows you to disable this behavior.
If you’re not using `--libReplacement`, you can now disable it with `--libReplacement false`.
In the future `--libReplacement false` may become the default, so if you currently rely on the behavior you should consider explicitly enabling it with `--libReplacement true`.

For more information, see the change here .

## Preserved Computed Property Names in Declaration Files

In an effort to make computed properties have more predictable emit in declaration files, TypeScript 5.8 will consistently preserve entity names (`bareVariables` and `dotted.names.that.look.like.this`) in computed property names in classes.

For example, consider the following code:



```id
tsexport let propName = "theAnswer";export class MyClass {    [propName] = 42;//  ~~~~~~~~~~// error!// A computed property name in a class property declaration must have a simple literal type or a 'unique symbol' type.}
```



Previous versions of TypeScript would issue an error when generating a declaration file for this module, and a best-effort declaration file would generate an index signature.



```id
tsexport declare let propName: string;export declare class MyClass {    [x: string]: number;}
```



In TypeScript 5.8, the example code is now allowed, and the emitted declaration file will match what you wrote:



```id
tsexport declare let propName: string;export declare class MyClass {    [propName]: number;}
```



Note that this does not create statically-named properties on the class.
You’ll still end up with what is effectively an index signature like `[x: string]: number`, so for that use case, you’d need to use `unique symbol`s or literal types.

Note that writing this code was and currently is an error under the `--isolatedDeclarations` flag;
but we expect that thanks to this change, computed property names will generally be permitted in declaration emit.

Note that it’s possible (though unlikely) that a file compiled in TypeScript 5.8 may generate a declaration file that is not backward compatible in TypeScript 5.7 or earlier.

For more information, see the implementing PR .

## Optimizations on Program Loads and Updates

TypeScript 5.8 introduces a number of optimizations that can both improve the time to build up a program, and also to update a program based on a file change in either `--watch` mode or editor scenarios.

First, TypeScript now avoids array allocations that would be involved while normalizing paths .
Typically, path normalization would involve segmenting each portion of a path into an array of strings, normalizing the resulting path based on relative segments, and then joining them back together using a canonical separator.
For projects with many files, this can be a significant and repetitive amount of work.
TypeScript now avoids allocating an array, and operates more directly on indexes of the original path.

Additionally, when edits are made that don’t change the fundamental structure of a project, TypeScript now avoids re-validating the options provided to it (e.g. the contents of a `tsconfig.json`).
This means, for example, that a simple edit might not require checking that the output paths of a project don’t conflict with the input paths.
Instead, the results of the last check can be used.
This should make edits in large projects feel more responsive.

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### `lib.d.ts`

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see linked issues related to DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates for this version of TypeScript .

### Restrictions on Import Assertions Under `--module nodenext`

Import assertions were a proposed addition to ECMAScript to ensure certain properties of an import (e.g. “this module is JSON, and is not intended to be executable JavaScript code”).
They were reinvented as a proposal called import attributes .
As part of the transition, they swapped from using the `assert` keyword to using the `with` keyword.



```id
ts// An import assertion ❌ - not future-compatible with most runtimes.import data from "./data.json" assert { type: "json" };// An import attribute ✅ - the preferred way to import a JSON file.import data from "./data.json" with { type: "json" };
```



Node.js 22 no longer accepts import assertions using the `assert` syntax.
In turn when `--module nodenext` is enabled in TypeScript 5.8, TypeScript will issue an error if it encounters an import assertion.



```id
tsimport data from "./data.json" assert { type: "json" };//                             ~~~~~~// error! Import assertions have been replaced by import attributes. Use 'with' instead of 'assert'
```

# TypeScript 5.7

 

## Checks for Never-Initialized Variables

For a long time, TypeScript has been able to catch issues when a variable has not yet been initialized in all prior branches.



```id
tslet result: numberif (someCondition()) {    result = doSomeWork();}else {    let temporaryWork = doSomeWork();    temporaryWork *= 2;    // forgot to assign to 'result'}console.log(result); // error: Variable 'result' is used before being assigned.
```



Unfortunately, there are some places where this analysis doesn’t work.
For example, if the variable is accessed in a separate function, the type system doesn’t know when the function will be called, and instead takes an “optimistic” view that the variable will be initialized.



```id
tsfunction foo() {    let result: number    if (someCondition()) {        result = doSomeWork();    }    else {        let temporaryWork = doSomeWork();        temporaryWork *= 2;        // forgot to assign to 'result'    }    printResult();    function printResult() {        console.log(result); // no error here.    }}
```



While TypeScript 5.7 is still lenient on variables that have possibly been initialized, the type system is able to report errors when variables have never been initialized at all.



```id
tsfunction foo() {    let result: number        // do work, but forget to assign to 'result'    function printResult() {        console.log(result); // error: Variable 'result' is used before being assigned.    }}
```



 This change was contributed thanks to the work of GitHub user Zzzen !

## Path Rewriting for Relative Paths

There are several tools and runtimes that allow you to run TypeScript code “in-place”, meaning they do not require a build step which generates output JavaScript files.
For example, ts-node, tsx, Deno, and Bun all support running `.ts` files directly.
More recently, Node.js has been investigating such support with `--experimental-strip-types` (soon to be unflagged!) and `--experimental-transform-types`.
This is extremely convenient because it allows us to iterate faster without worrying about re-running a build task.

There is some complexity to be aware of when using these modes though.
To be maximally compatible with all these tools, a TypeScript file that’s imported “in-place” must be imported with the appropriate TypeScript extension at runtime.
For example, to import a file called `foo.ts`, we have to write the following in Node’s new experimental support:



```id
ts// main.tsimport * as foo from "./foo.ts"; // <- we need foo.ts here, not foo.js
```



Typically, TypeScript would issue an error if we did this, because it expects us to import the output file .
Because some tools do allow `.ts` imports, TypeScript has supported this import style with an option called `--allowImportingTsExtensions` for a while now.
This works fine, but what happens if we need to actually generate `.js` files out of these `.ts` files?
This is a requirement for library authors who will need to be able to distribute just `.js` files, but up until now TypeScript has avoided rewriting any paths.

To support this scenario, we’ve added a new compiler option called `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`.
When an import path is relative (starts with `./` or `../`), ends in a TypeScript extension (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`), and is a non-declaration file, the compiler will rewrite the path to the corresponding JavaScript extension (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`).



```id
ts// Under --rewriteRelativeImportExtensions...// these will be rewritten.import * as foo from "./foo.ts";import * as bar from "../someFolder/bar.mts";// these will NOT be rewritten in any way.import * as a from "./foo";import * as b from "some-package/file.ts";import * as c from "@some-scope/some-package/file.ts";import * as d from "#/file.ts";import * as e from "./file.js";
```



This allows us to write TypeScript code that can be run in-place and then compiled into JavaScript when we’re ready.

Now, we noted that TypeScript generally avoided rewriting paths.
There are several reasons for this, but the most obvious one is dynamic imports.
If a developer writes the following, it’s not trivial to handle the path that `import` receives.
In fact, it’s impossible to override the behavior of `import` within any dependencies.



```id
tsfunction getPath() {    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {        return "./foo.ts";    }    else {        return "./foo.js";    }}let myImport = await import(getPath());
```



Another issue is that (as we saw above) only relative paths are rewritten, and they are written “naively”.
This means that any path that relies on TypeScript’s `baseUrl` and `paths` will not get rewritten:



```id
json// tsconfig.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "module": "nodenext",        // ...        "paths": {            "@/*": ["./src/*"]        }    }}
```




```id
ts// Won't be transformed, won't work.import * as utilities from "@/utilities.ts";
```



Nor will any path that might resolve through the `exports` and `imports` fields of a `package.json`.



```id
json// package.json{    "name": "my-package",    "imports": {        "#root/*": "./dist/*"    }}
```




```id
ts// Won't be transformed, won't work.import * as utilities from "#root/utilities.ts";
```



As a result, if you’ve been using a workspace-style layout with multiple packages referencing each other, you might need to use conditional exports with scoped custom conditions to make this work:



```id
json// my-package/package.json{    "name": "my-package",    "exports": {        ".": {            "@my-package/development": "./src/index.ts",            "import": "./lib/index.js"        },        "./*": {            "@my-package/development": "./src/*.ts",            "import": "./lib/*.js"        }    }}
```



Any time you want to import the `.ts` files, you can run it with `node --conditions=@my-package/development`.

Note the “namespace” or “scope” we used for the condition `@my-package/development`.
This is a bit of a makeshift solution to avoid conflicts from dependencies that might also use the `development` condition.
If everyone ships a `development` in their package, then resolution may try to resolve to a `.ts` file which will not necessarily work.
This idea is similar to what’s described in Colin McDonnell’s essay Live types in a TypeScript monorepo , along with tshy’s guidance for loading from source .

For more specifics on how this feature works, read up on the change here .

## Support for `--target es2024` and `--lib es2024`

TypeScript 5.7 now supports `--target es2024`, which allows users to target ECMAScript 2024 runtimes.
This target primarily enables specifying the new `--lib es2024` which contains many features for `SharedArrayBuffer` and `ArrayBuffer`, `Object.groupBy`, `Map.groupBy`, `Promise.withResolvers`, and more.
It also moves `Atomics.waitAsync` from `--lib es2022` to `--lib es2024`.

Note that as part of the changes to `SharedArrayBuffer` and `ArrayBuffer`, the two now diverge a bit.
To bridge the gap and preserve the underlying buffer type, all `TypedArrays` (like `Uint8Array` and others) are now also generic .



```id
tsinterface Uint8Array<TArrayBuffer extends ArrayBufferLike = ArrayBufferLike> {    // ...}
```



Each `TypedArray` now contains a type parameter named `TArrayBuffer`, though that type parameter has a default type argument so that we can continue to refer to `Int32Array` without explicitly writing out `Int32Array `.

If you encounter any issues as part of this update, you may need to update `@types/node`.

 This work was primarily provided thanks to Kenta Moriuchi !

## Searching Ancestor Configuration Files for Project Ownership

When a TypeScript file is loaded in an editor using TSServer (like Visual Studio or VS Code), the editor will try to find the relevant `tsconfig.json` file that “owns” the file.
To do this, it walks up the directory tree from the file being edited, looking for any file named `tsconfig.json`.

Previously, this search would stop at the first `tsconfig.json` file found;
however, imagine a project structure like the following:



```
project/├── src/│   ├── foo.ts│   ├── foo-test.ts│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── tsconfig.test.json└── tsconfig.json
```



Here, the idea is that `src/tsconfig.json` is the “main” configuration file for the project, and `src/tsconfig.test.json` is a configuration file for running tests.



```id
json// src/tsconfig.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "../dist"    },    "exclude": ["**/*.test.ts"]}
```




```id
json// src/tsconfig.test.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "../dist/test"    },    "include": ["**/*.test.ts"],    "references": [        { "path": "./tsconfig.json" }    ]}
```




```id
json// tsconfig.json{    // This is a "workspace-style" or "solution-style" tsconfig.    // Instead of specifying any files, it just references all the actual projects.    "files": [],    "references": [        { "path": "./src/tsconfig.json" },        { "path": "./src/tsconfig.test.json" },    ]}
```



The problem here is that when editing `foo-test.ts`, the editor would find `project/src/tsconfig.json` as the “owning” configuration file - but that’s not the one we want!
If the walk stops at this point, that might not be desirable.
The only way to avoid this previously was to rename `src/tsconfig.json` to something like `src/tsconfig.src.json`, and then all files would hit the top-level `tsconfig.json` which references every possible project.



```
project/├── src/│   ├── foo.ts│   ├── foo-test.ts│   ├── tsconfig.src.json│   └── tsconfig.test.json└── tsconfig.json
```



Instead of forcing developers to do this, TypeScript 5.7 now continues walking up the directory tree to find other appropriate `tsconfig.json` files for editor scenarios.
This can provide more flexibility in how projects are organized and how configuration files are structured.

You can get more specifics on the implementation on GitHub here and here .

## Faster Project Ownership Checks in Editors for Composite Projects

Imagine a large codebase with the following structure:



```
packages├── graphics/│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── src/│       └── ...├── sound/│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── src/│       └── ...├── networking/│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── src/│       └── ...├── input/│   ├── tsconfig.json│   └── src/│       └── ...└── app/    ├── tsconfig.json    ├── some-script.js    └── src/        └── ...
```



Each directory in `packages` is a separate TypeScript project, and the `app` directory is the main project that depends on all the other projects.



```id
json// app/tsconfig.json{    "compilerOptions": {        // ...    },    "include": ["src"],    "references": [        { "path": "../graphics/tsconfig.json" },        { "path": "../sound/tsconfig.json" },        { "path": "../networking/tsconfig.json" },        { "path": "../input/tsconfig.json" }    ]}
```



Now notice we have the file `some-script.js` in the `app` directory.
When we open `some-script.js` in the editor, the TypeScript language service (which also handles the editor experience for JavaScript files!) has to figure out which project the file belongs to so it can apply the right settings.

In this case, the nearest `tsconfig.json` does not include `some-script.js`, but TypeScript will proceed to ask “could one of the projects referenced by `app/tsconfig.json` include `some-script.js`?“.
To do so, TypeScript would previously load up each project, one-by-one, and stop as soon as it found a project which contained `some-script.js`.
Even if `some-script.js` isn’t included in the root set of files, TypeScript would still parse all the files within a project because some of the root set of files can still transitively reference `some-script.js`.

What we found over time was that this behavior caused extreme and unpredictable behavior in larger codebases.
Developers would open up stray script files and find themselves waiting for their entire codebase to be opened up.

Thankfully, every project that can be referenced by another (non-workspace) project must enable a flag called `composite`, which enforces a rule that all input source files must be known up-front.
So when probing a `composite` project, TypeScript 5.7 will only check if a file belongs to the root set of files of that project.
This should avoid this common worst-case behavior.

For more information, see the change here .

### Validated JSON Imports in `--module nodenext`

When importing from a `.json` file under `--module nodenext`, TypeScript will now enforce certain rules to prevent runtime errors.

For one, an import attribute containing `type: "json"` needs to be present for any JSON file import.



```id
tsimport myConfig from "./myConfig.json";//                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// ❌ error: Importing a JSON file into an ECMAScript module requires a 'type: "json"' import attribute when 'module' is set to 'NodeNext'.import myConfig from "./myConfig.json" with { type: "json" };//                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^// ✅ This is fine because we provided `type: "json"`
```



On top of this validation, TypeScript will not generate “named” exports, and the contents of a JSON import will only be accessible via a default.



```id
ts// ✅ This is okay:import myConfigA from "./myConfig.json" with { type: "json" };let version = myConfigA.version;///////////import * as myConfigB from "./myConfig.json" with { type: "json" };// ❌ This is not:let version = myConfig.version;// ✅ This is okay:let version = myConfig.default.version;
```

## Support for V8 Compile Caching in Node.js

Node.js 22 supports a new API called `module.enableCompileCache()` .
This API allows the runtime to reuse some of the parsing and compilation work done after the first run of a tool.

TypeScript 5.7 now leverages the API so that it can start doing useful work sooner.
In some of our own testing, we’ve witnessed about a 2.5x speed-up in running `tsc --version`.



```
Benchmark 1: node ./built/local/_tsc.js --version (*without* caching)  Time (mean ± σ):     122.2 ms ±   1.5 ms    [User: 101.7 ms, System: 13.0 ms]  Range (min … max):   119.3 ms … 132.3 ms    200 runs Benchmark 2: node ./built/local/tsc.js --version  (*with* caching)  Time (mean ± σ):      48.4 ms ±   1.0 ms    [User: 34.0 ms, System: 11.1 ms]  Range (min … max):    45.7 ms …  52.8 ms    200 runs Summary  node ./built/local/tsc.js --version ran    2.52 ± 0.06 times faster than node ./built/local/_tsc.js --version
```

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### `lib.d.ts`

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see linked issues related to DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates for this version of TypeScript .

### `TypedArray`s Are Now Generic Over `ArrayBufferLike`

In ECMAScript 2024, `SharedArrayBuffer` and `ArrayBuffer` have types that slightly diverge.
To bridge the gap and preserve the underlying buffer type, all `TypedArrays` (like `Uint8Array` and others) are now also generic .



```id
tsinterface Uint8Array<TArrayBuffer extends ArrayBufferLike = ArrayBufferLike> {    // ...}
```



Each `TypedArray` now contains a type parameter named `TArrayBuffer`, though that type parameter has a default type argument so that users can continue to refer to `Int32Array` without explicitly writing out `Int32Array `.

If you encounter any issues as part of this update, such as



```
error TS2322: Type 'Buffer' is not assignable to type 'Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'.error TS2345: Argument of type 'Buffer' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>'.error TS2345: Argument of type 'ArrayBufferLike' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ArrayBuffer'.error TS2345: Argument of type 'Buffer' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | ArrayBufferView | Stream | Iterable<string | ArrayBufferView> | AsyncIterable<string | ArrayBufferView>'.
```



then you may need to update `@types/node`.

You can read the specifics about this change on GitHub .

### Creating Index Signatures from Non-Literal Method Names in Classes

TypeScript now has a more consistent behavior for methods in classes when they are declared with non-literal computed property names.
For example, in the following:



```id
tsdeclare const symbolMethodName: symbol;export class A {    [symbolMethodName]() { return 1 };}
```



Previously TypeScript just viewed the class in a way like the following:



```id
tsexport class A {}
```



In other words, from the type system’s perspective, `[symbolMethodName]` contributed nothing to the type of `A`

TypeScript 5.7 now views the method `[symbolMethodName]() {}` more meaningfully, and generates an index signature.
As a result, the code above is interpreted as something like the following code:



```id
tsexport class A {    [x: symbol]: () => number;}
```



This provides behavior that is consistent with properties and methods in object literals.

 Read up more on this change here .

### More Implicit `any` Errors on Functions Returning `null` and `undefined`

When a function expression is contextually typed by a signature returning a generic type, TypeScript now appropriately provides an implicit `any` error under `noImplicitAny`, but outside of `strictNullChecks`.



```id
tsdeclare var p: Promise<number>;const p2 = p.catch(() => null);//                 ~~~~~~~~~~// error TS7011: Function expression, which lacks return-type annotation, implicitly has an 'any' return type.
```

# TypeScript 5.0

 

## Decorators

Decorators are an upcoming ECMAScript feature that allow us to customize classes and their members in a reusable way.

Let’s consider the following code:



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}const p = new Person("Ray");p.greet();
```



`greet` is pretty simple here, but let’s imagine it’s something way more complicated - maybe it does some async logic, it’s recursive, it has side effects, etc.
Regardless of what kind of ball-of-mud you’re imagining, let’s say you throw in some `console.log` calls to help debug `greet`.



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    greet() {        console.log("LOG: Entering method.");        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);        console.log("LOG: Exiting method.")    }}
```



This pattern is fairly common.
It sure would be nice if there was a way we could do this for every method!

This is where decorators come in.
We can write a function called `loggedMethod` that looks like the following:



```id
tsfunction loggedMethod(originalMethod: any, _context: any) {    function replacementMethod(this: any, ...args: any[]) {        console.log("LOG: Entering method.")        const result = originalMethod.call(this, ...args);        console.log("LOG: Exiting method.")        return result;    }    return replacementMethod;}
```



“What’s the deal with all of these `any`s?
What is this, `any`Script!?”

Just be patient - we’re keeping things simple for now so that we can focus on what this function is doing.
Notice that `loggedMethod` takes the original method (`originalMethod`) and returns a function that

 logs an “Entering…” message

- passes along `this` and all of its arguments to the original method

- logs an “Exiting…” message, and

- returns whatever the original method returned.

Now we can use `loggedMethod` to decorate the method `greet`:



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    @loggedMethod    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}const p = new Person("Ray");p.greet();// Output:////   LOG: Entering method.//   Hello, my name is Ray.//   LOG: Exiting method.
```



We just used `loggedMethod` as a decorator above `greet` - and notice that we wrote it as `@loggedMethod`.
When we did that, it got called with the method target and a context object .
Because `loggedMethod` returned a new function, that function replaced the original definition of `greet`.

We didn’t mention it yet, but `loggedMethod` was defined with a second parameter.
It’s called a “context object”, and it has some useful information about how the decorated method was declared - like whether it was a `#private` member, or `static`, or what the name of the method was.
Let’s rewrite `loggedMethod` to take advantage of that and print out the name of the method that was decorated.



```id
tsfunction loggedMethod(originalMethod: any, context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext) {    const methodName = String(context.name);    function replacementMethod(this: any, ...args: any[]) {        console.log(`LOG: Entering method '${methodName}'.`)        const result = originalMethod.call(this, ...args);        console.log(`LOG: Exiting method '${methodName}'.`)        return result;    }    return replacementMethod;}
```



We’re now using the context parameter - and that it’s the first thing in `loggedMethod` that has a type stricter than `any` and `any[]`.
TypeScript provides a type called `ClassMethodDecoratorContext` that models the context object that method decorators take.

Apart from metadata, the context object for methods also has a useful function called `addInitializer`.
It’s a way to hook into the beginning of the constructor (or the initialization of the class itself if we’re working with `static`s).

As an example - in JavaScript, it’s common to write something like the following pattern:



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;        this.greet = this.greet.bind(this);    }    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}
```



Alternatively, `greet` might be declared as a property initialized to an arrow function.



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    greet = () => {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    };}
```



This code is written to ensure that `this` isn’t re-bound if `greet` is called as a stand-alone function or passed as a callback.



```id
tsconst greet = new Person("Ray").greet;// We don't want this to fail!greet();
```



We can write a decorator that uses `addInitializer` to call `bind` in the constructor for us.



```id
tsfunction bound(originalMethod: any, context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext) {    const methodName = context.name;    if (context.private) {        throw new Error(`'bound' cannot decorate private properties like ${methodName as string}.`);    }    context.addInitializer(function () {        this[methodName] = this[methodName].bind(this);    });}
```



`bound` isn’t returning anything - so when it decorates a method, it leaves the original alone.
Instead, it will add logic before any other fields are initialized.



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    @bound    @loggedMethod    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}const p = new Person("Ray");const greet = p.greet;// Works!greet();
```



Notice that we stacked two decorators - `@bound` and `@loggedMethod`.
These decorations run in “reverse order”.
That is, `@loggedMethod` decorates the original method `greet`, and `@bound` decorates the result of `@loggedMethod`.
In this example, it doesn’t matter - but it could if your decorators have side-effects or expect a certain order.

Also worth noting - if you’d prefer stylistically, you can put these decorators on the same line.



```id
ts    @bound @loggedMethod greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }
```



Something that might not be obvious is that we can even make functions that return decorator functions.
That makes it possible to customize the final decorator just a little.
If we wanted, we could have made `loggedMethod` return a decorator and customize how it logs its messages.



```id
tsfunction loggedMethod(headMessage = "LOG:") {    return function actualDecorator(originalMethod: any, context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext) {        const methodName = String(context.name);        function replacementMethod(this: any, ...args: any[]) {            console.log(`${headMessage} Entering method '${methodName}'.`)            const result = originalMethod.call(this, ...args);            console.log(`${headMessage} Exiting method '${methodName}'.`)            return result;        }        return replacementMethod;    }}
```



If we did that, we’d have to call `loggedMethod` before using it as a decorator.
We could then pass in any string as the prefix for messages that get logged to the console.



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    @loggedMethod("⚠️")    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}const p = new Person("Ray");p.greet();// Output:////   ⚠️ Entering method 'greet'.//   Hello, my name is Ray.//   ⚠️ Exiting method 'greet'.
```



Decorators can be used on more than just methods!
They can be used on properties/fields, getters, setters, and auto-accessors.
Even classes themselves can be decorated for things like subclassing and registration.

To learn more about decorators in-depth, you can read up on Axel Rauschmayer’s extensive summary .

### Differences with Experimental Legacy Decorators

If you’ve been using TypeScript for a while, you might be aware of the fact that it’s had support for “experimental” decorators for years.
While these experimental decorators have been incredibly useful, they modeled a much older version of the decorators proposal, and always required an opt-in compiler flag called `--experimentalDecorators`.
Any attempt to use decorators in TypeScript without this flag used to prompt an error message.

`--experimentalDecorators` will continue to exist for the foreseeable future;
however, without the flag, decorators will now be valid syntax for all new code.
Outside of `--experimentalDecorators`, they will be type-checked and emitted differently.
The type-checking rules and emit are sufficiently different that while decorators can be written to support both the old and new decorators behavior, any existing decorator functions are not likely to do so.

This new decorators proposal is not compatible with `--emitDecoratorMetadata`, and it does not allow decorating parameters.
Future ECMAScript proposals may be able to help bridge that gap.

On a final note: in addition to allowing decorators to be placed before the `export` keyword, the proposal for decorators now provides the option of placing decorators after `export` or `export default`.
The only exception is that mixing the two styles is not allowed.



```id
js// ✅ allowed@register export default class Foo {    // ...}// ✅ also allowedexport default @register class Bar {    // ...}// ❌ error - before *and* after is not allowed@before export @after class Bar {    // ...}
```



### Writing Well-Typed Decorators

The `loggedMethod` and `bound` decorator examples above are intentionally simple and omit lots of details about types.

Typing decorators can be fairly complex.
For example, a well-typed version of `loggedMethod` from above might look something like this:



```id
tsfunction loggedMethod<This, Args extends any[], Return>(    target: (this: This, ...args: Args) => Return,    context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext<This, (this: This, ...args: Args) => Return>) {    const methodName = String(context.name);    function replacementMethod(this: This, ...args: Args): Return {        console.log(`LOG: Entering method '${methodName}'.`)        const result = target.call(this, ...args);        console.log(`LOG: Exiting method '${methodName}'.`)        return result;    }    return replacementMethod;}
```



We had to separately model out the type of `this`, the parameters, and the return type of the original method, using the type parameters `This`, `Args`, and `Return`.

Exactly how complex your decorators functions are defined depends on what you want to guarantee.
Just keep in mind, your decorators will be used more than they’re written, so a well-typed version will usually be preferable - but there’s clearly a trade-off with readability, so try to keep things simple.

More documentation on writing decorators will be available in the future - but this post should have a good amount of detail for the mechanics of decorators.

## `const` Type Parameters

When inferring the type of an object, TypeScript will usually choose a type that’s meant to be general.
For example, in this case, the inferred type of `names` is `string[]`:



```id
tstype HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };function getNamesExactly<T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T["names"] {    return arg.names;}// Inferred type: string[]const names = getNamesExactly({ names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]});
```



Usually the intent of this is to enable mutation down the line.

However, depending on what exactly `getNamesExactly` does and how it’s intended to be used, it can often be the case that a more-specific type is desired.

Up until now, API authors have typically had to recommend adding `as const` in certain places to achieve the desired inference:



```id
ts// The type we wanted://    readonly ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]// The type we got://    string[]const names1 = getNamesExactly({ names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]});// Correctly gets what we wanted://    readonly ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]const names2 = getNamesExactly({ names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]} as const);
```



This can be cumbersome and easy to forget.
In TypeScript 5.0, you can now add a `const` modifier to a type parameter declaration to cause `const`-like inference to be the default:



```id
tstype HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };function getNamesExactly<const T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T["names"] {//                       ^^^^^    return arg.names;}// Inferred type: readonly ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]// Note: Didn't need to write 'as const' hereconst names = getNamesExactly({ names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"] });
```



Note that the `const` modifier doesn’t reject mutable values, and doesn’t require immutable constraints.
Using a mutable type constraint might give surprising results.
For example:



```id
tsdeclare function fnBad<const T extends string[]>(args: T): void;// 'T' is still 'string[]' since 'readonly ["a", "b", "c"]' is not assignable to 'string[]'fnBad(["a", "b" ,"c"]);
```



Here, the inferred candidate for `T` is `readonly ["a", "b", "c"]`, and a `readonly` array can’t be used where a mutable one is needed.
In this case, inference falls back to the constraint, the array is treated as `string[]`, and the call still proceeds successfully.

A better definition of this function should use `readonly string[]`:



```id
tsdeclare function fnGood<const T extends readonly string[]>(args: T): void;// T is readonly ["a", "b", "c"]fnGood(["a", "b" ,"c"]);
```



Similarly, remember to keep in mind that the `const` modifier only affects inference of object, array and primitive expressions that were written within the call, so arguments which wouldn’t (or couldn’t) be modified with `as const` won’t see any change in behavior:



```id
tsdeclare function fnGood<const T extends readonly string[]>(args: T): void;const arr = ["a", "b" ,"c"];// 'T' is still 'string[]'-- the 'const' modifier has no effect herefnGood(arr);
```



 See the pull request and the ( first and second ) motivating issues for more details.

## Supporting Multiple Configuration Files in `extends`

When managing multiple projects, it can be helpful to have a “base” configuration file that other `tsconfig.json` files can extend from.
That’s why TypeScript supports an `extends` field for copying over fields from `compilerOptions`.



```id
jsonc// packages/front-end/src/tsconfig.json{    "extends": "../../../tsconfig.base.json",    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "../lib",        // ...    }}
```



However, there are scenarios where you might want to extend from multiple configuration files.
For example, imagine using a TypeScript base configuration file shipped to npm .
If you want all your projects to also use the options from the `@tsconfig/strictest` package on npm, then there’s a simple solution: have `tsconfig.base.json` extend from `@tsconfig/strictest`:



```id
jsonc// tsconfig.base.json{    "extends": "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",    "compilerOptions": {        // ...    }}
```



This works to a point.
If you have any projects that don’t want to use `@tsconfig/strictest`, they have to either manually disable the options, or create a separate version of `tsconfig.base.json` that doesn’t extend from `@tsconfig/strictest`.

To give some more flexibility here, Typescript 5.0 now allows the `extends` field to take multiple entries.
For example, in this configuration file:



```id
jsonc{    "extends": ["a", "b", "c"],    "compilerOptions": {        // ...    }}
```



Writing this is kind of like extending `c` directly, where `c` extends `b`, and `b` extends `a`.
If any fields “conflict”, the latter entry wins.

So in the following example, both `strictNullChecks` and `noImplicitAny` are enabled in the final `tsconfig.json`.



```id
jsonc// tsconfig1.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "strictNullChecks": true    }}// tsconfig2.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "noImplicitAny": true    }}// tsconfig.json{    "extends": ["./tsconfig1.json", "./tsconfig2.json"],    "files": ["./index.ts"]}
```



As another example, we can rewrite our original example in the following way.



```id
jsonc// packages/front-end/src/tsconfig.json{    "extends": ["@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json", "../../../tsconfig.base.json"],    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "../lib",        // ...    }}
```

## All `enum`s Are Union `enum`s

When TypeScript originally introduced enums, they were nothing more than a set of numeric constants with the same type.



```id
tsenum E {    Foo = 10,    Bar = 20,}
```



The only thing special about `E.Foo` and `E.Bar` was that they were assignable to anything expecting the type `E`.
Other than that, they were pretty much just `number`s.



```id
tsfunction takeValue(e: E) {}takeValue(E.Foo); // workstakeValue(123); // error!
```



It wasn’t until TypeScript 2.0 introduced enum literal types that enums got a bit more special.
Enum literal types gave each enum member its own type, and turned the enum itself into a union of each member type.
They also allowed us to refer to only a subset of the types of an enum, and to narrow away those types.



```id
ts// Color is like a union of Red | Orange | Yellow | Green | Blue | Violetenum Color {    Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, /* Indigo, */ Violet}// Each enum member has its own type that we can refer to!type PrimaryColor = Color.Red | Color.Green | Color.Blue;function isPrimaryColor(c: Color): c is PrimaryColor {    // Narrowing literal types can catch bugs.    // TypeScript will error here because    // we'll end up comparing 'Color.Red' to 'Color.Green'.    // We meant to use ||, but accidentally wrote &&.    return c === Color.Red && c === Color.Green && c === Color.Blue;}
```



One issue with giving each enum member its own type was that those types were in some part associated with the actual value of the member.
In some cases it’s not possible to compute that value - for instance, an enum member could be initialized by a function call.



```id
tsenum E {    Blah = Math.random()}
```



Whenever TypeScript ran into these issues, it would quietly back out and use the old enum strategy.
That meant giving up all the advantages of unions and literal types.

TypeScript 5.0 manages to make all enums into union enums by creating a unique type for each computed member.
That means that all enums can now be narrowed and have their members referenced as types as well.

For more details on this change, you can read the specifics on GitHub .

## `--moduleResolution bundler`

TypeScript 4.7 introduced the `node16` and `nodenext` options for its `--module` and `--moduleResolution` settings.
The intent of these options was to better model the precise lookup rules for ECMAScript modules in Node.js;
however, this mode has many restrictions that other tools don’t really enforce.

For example, in an ECMAScript module in Node.js, any relative import needs to include a file extension.



```id
js// entry.mjsimport * as utils from "./utils";     // ❌ wrong - we need to include the file extension.import * as utils from "./utils.mjs"; // ✅ works
```



There are certain reasons for this in Node.js and the browser - it makes file lookups faster and works better for naive file servers.
But for many developers using tools like bundlers, the `node16`/`nodenext` settings were cumbersome because bundlers don’t have most of these restrictions.
In some ways, the `node` resolution mode was better for anyone using a bundler.

But in some ways, the original `node` resolution mode was already out of date.
Most modern bundlers use a fusion of the ECMAScript module and CommonJS lookup rules in Node.js.
For example, extensionless imports work just fine just like in CommonJS, but when looking through the `export` conditions of a package, they’ll prefer an `import` condition just like in an ECMAScript file.

To model how bundlers work, TypeScript now introduces a new strategy: `--moduleResolution bundler`.



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "target": "esnext",        "moduleResolution": "bundler"    }}
```



If you are using a modern bundler like Vite, esbuild, swc, Webpack, Parcel, and others that implement a hybrid lookup strategy, the new `bundler` option should be a good fit for you.

On the other hand, if you’re writing a library that’s meant to be published on npm, using the `bundler` option can hide compatibility issues that may arise for your users who aren’t using a bundler.
So in these cases, using the `node16` or `nodenext` resolution options is likely to be a better path.

To read more on `--moduleResolution bundler`, take a look at the implementing pull request .

## Resolution Customization Flags

JavaScript tooling may now model “hybrid” resolution rules, like in the `bundler` mode we described above.
Because tools may differ in their support slightly, TypeScript 5.0 provides ways to enable or disable a few features that may or may not work with your configuration.

### `allowImportingTsExtensions`

`--allowImportingTsExtensions` allows TypeScript files to import each other with a TypeScript-specific extension like `.ts`, `.mts`, or `.tsx`.

This flag is only allowed when `--noEmit` or `--emitDeclarationOnly` is enabled, since these import paths would not be resolvable at runtime in JavaScript output files.
The expectation here is that your resolver (e.g. your bundler, a runtime, or some other tool) is going to make these imports between `.ts` files work.

### `resolvePackageJsonExports`

`--resolvePackageJsonExports` forces TypeScript to consult the `exports` field of `package.json` files if it ever reads from a package in `node_modules`.

This option defaults to `true` under the `node16`, `nodenext`, and `bundler` options for `--moduleResolution`.

### `resolvePackageJsonImports`

`--resolvePackageJsonImports` forces TypeScript to consult the `imports` field of `package.json` files when performing a lookup that starts with `#` from a file whose ancestor directory contains a `package.json`.

This option defaults to `true` under the `node16`, `nodenext`, and `bundler` options for `--moduleResolution`.

### `allowArbitraryExtensions`

In TypeScript 5.0, when an import path ends in an extension that isn’t a known JavaScript or TypeScript file extension, the compiler will look for a declaration file for that path in the form of `{file basename}.d.{extension}.ts`.
For example, if you are using a CSS loader in a bundler project, you might want to write (or generate) declaration files for those stylesheets:



```id
css/* app.css */.cookie-banner {  display: none;}
```




```id
ts// app.d.css.tsdeclare const css: {  cookieBanner: string;};export default css;
```




```id
ts// App.tsximport styles from "./app.css";styles.cookieBanner; // string
```



By default, this import will raise an error to let you know that TypeScript doesn’t understand this file type and your runtime might not support importing it.
But if you’ve configured your runtime or bundler to handle it, you can suppress the error with the new `--allowArbitraryExtensions` compiler option.

Note that historically, a similar effect has often been achievable by adding a declaration file named `app.css.d.ts` instead of `app.d.css.ts` - however, this just worked through Node’s `require` resolution rules for CommonJS.
Strictly speaking, the former is interpreted as a declaration file for a JavaScript file named `app.css.js`.
Because relative files imports need to include extensions in Node’s ESM support, TypeScript would error on our example in an ESM file under `--moduleResolution node16` or `nodenext`.

For more information, read up the proposal for this feature and its corresponding pull request .

### `customConditions`

`--customConditions` takes a list of additional conditions that should succeed when TypeScript resolves from an `exports` or `imports` field of a `package.json`.
These conditions are added to whatever existing conditions a resolver will use by default.

For example, when this field is set in a `tsconfig.json` as so:



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "target": "es2022",        "moduleResolution": "bundler",        "customConditions": ["my-condition"]    }}
```



Any time an `exports` or `imports` field is referenced in `package.json`, TypeScript will consider conditions called `my-condition`.

So when importing from a package with the following `package.json`



```id
jsonc{    // ...    "exports": {        ".": {            "my-condition": "./foo.mjs",            "node": "./bar.mjs",            "import": "./baz.mjs",            "require": "./biz.mjs"        }    }}
```



TypeScript will try to look for files corresponding to `foo.mjs`.

This field is only valid under the `node16`, `nodenext`, and `bundler` options for `--moduleResolution`

## `--verbatimModuleSyntax`

By default, TypeScript does something called import elision .
Basically, if you write something like



```id
tsimport { Car } from "./car";export function drive(car: Car) {    // ...}
```



TypeScript detects that you’re only using an import for types and drops the import entirely.
Your output JavaScript might look something like this:



```id
jsexport function drive(car) {    // ...}
```



Most of the time this is good, because if `Car` isn’t a value that’s exported from `./car`, we’ll get a runtime error.

But it does add a layer of complexity for certain edge cases.
For example, notice there’s no statement like `import "./car";` - the import was dropped entirely.
That actually makes a difference for modules that have side-effects or not.

TypeScript’s emit strategy for JavaScript also has another few layers of complexity - import elision isn’t always just driven by how an import is used - it often consults how a value is declared as well.
So it’s not always clear whether code like the following



```id
tsexport { Car } from "./car";
```



should be preserved or dropped.
If `Car` is declared with something like a `class`, then it can be preserved in the resulting JavaScript file.
But if `Car` is only declared as a `type` alias or `interface`, then the JavaScript file shouldn’t export `Car` at all.

While TypeScript might be able to make these emit decisions based on information from across files, not every compiler can.

The `type` modifier on imports and exports helps with these situations a bit.
We can make it explicit whether an import or export is only being used for type analysis, and can be dropped entirely in JavaScript files by using the `type` modifier.



```id
ts// This statement can be dropped entirely in JS outputimport type * as car from "./car";// The named import/export 'Car' can be dropped in JS outputimport { type Car } from "./car";export { type Car } from "./car";
```



`type` modifiers are not quite useful on their own - by default, module elision will still drop imports, and nothing forces you to make the distinction between `type` and plain imports and exports.
So TypeScript has the flag `--importsNotUsedAsValues` to make sure you use the `type` modifier, `--preserveValueImports` to prevent some module elision behavior, and `--isolatedModules` to make sure that your TypeScript code works across different compilers.
Unfortunately, understanding the fine details of those 3 flags is hard, and there are still some edge cases with unexpected behavior.

TypeScript 5.0 introduces a new option called `--verbatimModuleSyntax` to simplify the situation.
The rules are much simpler - any imports or exports without a `type` modifier are left around.
Anything that uses the `type` modifier is dropped entirely.



```id
ts// Erased away entirely.import type { A } from "a";// Rewritten to 'import { b } from "bcd";'import { b, type c, type d } from "bcd";// Rewritten to 'import {} from "xyz";'import { type xyz } from "xyz";
```



With this new option, what you see is what you get.

That does have some implications when it comes to module interop though.
Under this flag, ECMAScript `import`s and `export`s won’t be rewritten to `require` calls when your settings or file extension implied a different module system.
Instead, you’ll get an error.
If you need to emit code that uses `require` and `module.exports`, you’ll have to use TypeScript’s module syntax that predates ES2015:

 
 
 
 Input TypeScript 
 Output JavaScript 
 
 
 
 


```id
tsimport foo = require("foo");
```


 
 


```id
jsconst foo = require("foo");
```


 
 
 
 


```id
tsfunction foo() {}function bar() {}function baz() {}export = {    foo,    bar,    baz};
```


 
 


```id
jsfunction foo() {}function bar() {}function baz() {}module.exports = {    foo,    bar,    baz};
```


 
 
 

While this is a limitation, it does help make some issues more obvious.
For example, it’s very common to forget to set the `type` field in `package.json` under `--module node16`.
As a result, developers would start writing CommonJS modules instead of ES modules without realizing it, giving surprising lookup rules and JavaScript output.
This new flag ensures that you’re intentional about the file type you’re using because the syntax is intentionally different.

Because `--verbatimModuleSyntax` provides a more consistent story than `--importsNotUsedAsValues` and `--preserveValueImports`, those two existing flags are being deprecated in its favor.

For more details, read up on [the original pull request] https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/52203 and its proposal issue .

## Support for `export type *`

When TypeScript 3.8 introduced type-only imports, the new syntax wasn’t allowed on `export * from "module"` or `export * as ns from "module"` re-exports. TypeScript 5.0 adds support for both of these forms:



```id
ts// models/vehicles.tsexport class Spaceship {  // ...}// models/index.tsexport type * as vehicles from "./vehicles";// main.tsimport { vehicles } from "./models";function takeASpaceship(s: vehicles.Spaceship) {  // ✅ ok - `vehicles` only used in a type position}function makeASpaceship() {  return new vehicles.Spaceship();  //         ^^^^^^^^  // 'vehicles' cannot be used as a value because it was exported using 'export type'.}
```



You can read more about the implementation here .

## `@satisfies` Support in JSDoc

TypeScript 4.9 introduced the `satisfies` operator.
It made sure that the type of an expression was compatible, without affecting the type itself.
For example, let’s take the following code:



```id
tsinterface CompilerOptions {    strict?: boolean;    outDir?: string;    // ...}interface ConfigSettings {    compilerOptions?: CompilerOptions;    extends?: string | string[];    // ...}let myConfigSettings = {    compilerOptions: {        strict: true,        outDir: "../lib",        // ...    },    extends: [        "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",        "../../../tsconfig.base.json"    ],} satisfies ConfigSettings;
```



Here, TypeScript knows that `myConfigSettings.extends` was declared with an array - because while `satisfies` validated the type of our object, it didn’t bluntly change it to `CompilerOptions` and lose information.
So if we want to map over `extends`, that’s fine.



```id
tsdeclare function resolveConfig(configPath: string): CompilerOptions;let inheritedConfigs = myConfigSettings.extends.map(resolveConfig);
```



This was helpful for TypeScript users, but plenty of people use TypeScript to type-check their JavaScript code using JSDoc annotations.
That’s why TypeScript 5.0 is supporting a new JSDoc tag called `@satisfies` that does exactly the same thing.

`/** @satisfies */` can catch type mismatches:



```id
js// @ts-check/** * @typedef CompilerOptions * @prop {boolean} [strict] * @prop {string} [outDir] *//** * @satisfies {CompilerOptions} */let myCompilerOptions = {    outdir: "../lib",//  ~~~~~~ oops! we meant outDir};
```



But it will preserve the original type of our expressions, allowing us to use our values more precisely later on in our code.



```id
js// @ts-check/** * @typedef CompilerOptions * @prop {boolean} [strict] * @prop {string} [outDir] *//** * @typedef ConfigSettings * @prop {CompilerOptions} [compilerOptions] * @prop {string | string[]} [extends] *//** * @satisfies {ConfigSettings} */let myConfigSettings = {    compilerOptions: {        strict: true,        outDir: "../lib",    },    extends: [        "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",        "../../../tsconfig.base.json"    ],};let inheritedConfigs = myConfigSettings.extends.map(resolveConfig);
```



`/** @satisfies */` can also be used inline on any parenthesized expression.
We could have written `myCompilerOptions` like this:



```id
tslet myConfigSettings = /** @satisfies {ConfigSettings} */ ({    compilerOptions: {        strict: true,        outDir: "../lib",    },    extends: [        "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",        "../../../tsconfig.base.json"    ],});
```



Why?
Well, it usually makes more sense when you’re deeper in some other code, like a function call.



```id
jscompileCode(/** @satisfies {CompilerOptions} */ ({    // ...}));
```



 This feature was provided thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk !

## `@overload` Support in JSDoc

In TypeScript, you can specify overloads for a function.
Overloads give us a way to say that a function can be called with different arguments, and possibly return different results.
They can restrict how callers can actually use our functions, and refine what results they’ll get back.



```id
ts// Our overloads:function printValue(str: string): void;function printValue(num: number, maxFractionDigits?: number): void;// Our implementation:function printValue(value: string | number, maximumFractionDigits?: number) {    if (typeof value === "number") {        const formatter = Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {            maximumFractionDigits,        });        value = formatter.format(value);    }    console.log(value);}
```



Here, we’ve said that `printValue` takes either a `string` or a `number` as its first argument.
If it takes a `number`, it can take a second argument to determine how many fractional digits we can print.

TypeScript 5.0 now allows JSDoc to declare overloads with a new `@overload` tag.
Each JSDoc comment with an `@overload` tag is treated as a distinct overload for the following function declaration.



```id
js// @ts-check/** * @overload * @param {string} value * @return {void} *//** * @overload * @param {number} value * @param {number} [maximumFractionDigits] * @return {void} *//** * @param {string | number} value * @param {number} [maximumFractionDigits] */function printValue(value, maximumFractionDigits) {    if (typeof value === "number") {        const formatter = Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {            maximumFractionDigits,        });        value = formatter.format(value);    }    console.log(value);}
```



Now regardless of whether we’re writing in a TypeScript or JavaScript file, TypeScript can let us know if we’ve called our functions incorrectly.



```id
ts// all allowedprintValue("hello!");printValue(123.45);printValue(123.45, 2);printValue("hello!", 123); // error!
```



This new tag was implemented thanks to Tomasz Lenarcik .

## Passing Emit-Specific Flags Under `--build`

TypeScript now allows the following flags to be passed under `--build` mode

- `--declaration`

- `--emitDeclarationOnly`

- `--declarationMap`

- `--sourceMap`

- `--inlineSourceMap`

This makes it way easier to customize certain parts of a build where you might have different development and production builds.

For example, a development build of a library might not need to produce declaration files, but a production build would.
A project can configure declaration emit to be off by default and simply be built with



```id
shtsc --build -p ./my-project-dir
```



Once you’re done iterating in the inner loop, a “production” build can just pass the `--declaration` flag.



```id
shtsc --build -p ./my-project-dir --declaration
```



 More information on this change is available here .

## Case-Insensitive Import Sorting in Editors

In editors like Visual Studio and VS Code, TypeScript powers the experience for organizing and sorting imports and exports.
Often though, there can be different interpretations of when a list is “sorted”.

For example, is the following import list sorted?



```id
tsimport {    Toggle,    freeze,    toBoolean,} from "./utils";
```



The answer might surprisingly be “it depends”.
If we don’t care about case-sensitivity, then this list is clearly not sorted.
The letter `f` comes before both `t` and `T`.

But in most programming languages, sorting defaults to comparing the byte values of strings.
The way JavaScript compares strings means that `"Toggle"` always comes before `"freeze"` because according to the ASCII character encoding , uppercase letters come before lowercase.
So from that perspective, the import list is sorted.

TypeScript previously considered the import list to be sorted because it was doing a basic case-sensitive sort.
This could be a point of frustration for developers who preferred a case- insensitive ordering, or who used tools like ESLint which require case-insensitive ordering by default.

TypeScript now detects case sensitivity by default.
This means that TypeScript and tools like ESLint typically won’t “fight” each other over how to best sort imports.

Our team has also been experimenting with further sorting strategies which you can read about here .
These options may eventually be configurable by editors.
For now, they are still unstable and experimental, and you can opt into them in VS Code today by using the `typescript.unstable` entry in your JSON options.
Below are all of the options you can try out (set to their defaults):



```id
jsonc{    "typescript.unstable": {        // Should sorting be case-sensitive?

## Exhaustive `switch`/`case` Completions

When writing a `switch` statement, TypeScript now detects when the value being checked has a literal type.
If so, it will offer a completion that scaffolds out each uncovered `case`.

## Speed, Memory, and Package Size Optimizations

TypeScript 5.0 contains lots of powerful changes across our code structure, our data structures, and algorithmic implementations.
What these all mean is that your entire experience should be faster - not just running TypeScript, but even installing it.

Here are a few interesting wins in speed and size that we’ve been able to capture relative to TypeScript 4.9.

How?
There are a few notable improvements we’d like give more details on in the future.
But we won’t make you wait for that blog post.

First off, we recently migrated TypeScript from namespaces to modules, allowing us to leverage modern build tooling that can perform optimizations like scope hoisting.
Using this tooling, revisiting our packaging strategy, and removing some deprecated code has shaved off about 26.4 MB from TypeScript 4.9’s 63.8 MB package size.
It also brought us a notable speed-up through direct function calls.

TypeScript also added more uniformity to internal object types within the compiler, and also slimmed the data stored on some of these object types as well.
This reduced polymorphic and megamorphic use sites, while offsetting most of the necessary memory consumption that was necessary for uniform shapes.

We’ve also performed some caching when serializing information to strings.
Type display, which can happen as part of error reporting, declaration emit, code completions, and more, can end up being fairly expensive.
TypeScript now caches some commonly used machinery to reuse across these operations.

Another notable change we made that improved our parser was leveraging `var` to occasionally side-step the cost of using `let` and `const` across closures.
This improved some of our parsing performance.

Overall, we expect most codebases should see speed improvements from TypeScript 5.0, and have consistently been able to reproduce wins between 10% to 20%.
Of course this will depend on hardware and codebase characteristics, but we encourage you to try it out on your codebase today!

For more information, see some of our notable optimizations:

- Migrate to Modules 

- `Node` Monomorphization 

- `Symbol` Monomorphization 

- `Identifier` Size Reduction 

- `Printer` Caching 

- Limited Usage of `var` 

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

### Runtime Requirements

TypeScript now targets ECMAScript 2018.
For Node users, that means a minimum version requirement of at least Node.js 10 and later.

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Changes to how types for the DOM are generated might have an impact on existing code.
Notably, certain properties have been converted from `number` to numeric literal types, and properties and methods for cut, copy, and paste event handling have been moved across interfaces.

### API Breaking Changes

In TypeScript 5.0, we moved to modules, removed some unnecessary interfaces, and made some correctness improvements.
For more details on what’s changed, see our API Breaking Changes page.

### Forbidden Implicit Coercions in Relational Operators

Certain operations in TypeScript will already warn you if you write code which may cause an implicit string-to-number coercion:



```id
tsfunction func(ns: number | string) {  return ns * 4; // Error, possible implicit coercion}
```



In 5.0, this will also be applied to the relational operators `>`, ` =`:



```id
tsfunction func(ns: number | string) {  return ns > 4; // Now also an error}
```



To allow this if desired, you can explicitly coerce the operand to a `number` using `+`:



```id
tsfunction func(ns: number | string) {  return +ns > 4; // OK}
```



This correctness improvement was contributed courtesy of Mateusz Burzyński .

### Enum Overhaul

TypeScript has had some long-standing oddities around `enum`s ever since its first release.
In 5.0, we’re cleaning up some of these problems, as well as reducing the concept count needed to understand the various kinds of `enum`s you can declare.

There are two main new errors you might see as part of this.
The first is that assigning an out-of-domain literal to an `enum` type will now error as one might expect:



```id
tsenum SomeEvenDigit {    Zero = 0,    Two = 2,    Four = 4}// Now correctly an errorlet m: SomeEvenDigit = 1;
```



The other is that declaration of certain kinds of indirected mixed string/number `enum` forms would, incorrectly, create an all-number `enum`:



```id
tsenum Letters {    A = "a"}enum Numbers {    one = 1,    two = Letters.A}// Now correctly an errorconst t: number = Numbers.two;
```



You can see more details in relevant change .

### More Accurate Type-Checking for Parameter Decorators in Constructors Under `--experimentalDecorators`

TypeScript 5.0 makes type-checking more accurate for decorators under `--experimentalDecorators`.
One place where this becomes apparent is when using a decorator on a constructor parameter.



```id
tsexport declare const inject:  (entity: any) =>    (target: object, key: string | symbol, index?: number) => void;export class Foo {}export class C {    constructor(@inject(Foo) private x: any) {    }}
```



This call will fail because `key` expects a `string | symbol`, but constructor parameters receive a key of `undefined`.
The correct fix is to change the type of `key` within `inject`.
A reasonable workaround if you’re using a library that can’t be upgraded is is to wrap `inject` in a more type-safe decorator function, and use a type-assertion on `key`.

For more details, see this issue .

### Deprecations and Default Changes

In TypeScript 5.0, we’ve deprecated the following settings and setting values:

- `--target: ES3`

- `--out`

- `--noImplicitUseStrict`

- `--keyofStringsOnly`

- `--suppressExcessPropertyErrors`

- `--suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors`

- `--noStrictGenericChecks`

- `--charset`

- `--importsNotUsedAsValues`

- `--preserveValueImports`

- `prepend` in project references

These configurations will continue to be allowed until TypeScript 5.5, at which point they will be removed entirely, however, you will receive a warning if you are using these settings.
In TypeScript 5.0, as well as future releases 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, you can specify `"ignoreDeprecations": "5.0"` to silence those warnings.
We’ll also shortly be releasing a 4.9 patch to allow specifying `ignoreDeprecations` to allow for smoother upgrades.
Aside from deprecations, we’ve changed some settings to better improve cross-platform behavior in TypeScript.

`--newLine`, which controls the line endings emitted in JavaScript files, used to be inferred based on the current operating system if not specified.
We think builds should be as deterministic as possible, and Windows Notepad supports line-feed line endings now, so the new default setting is `LF`.
The old OS-specific inference behavior is no longer available.

`--forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`, which ensured that all references to the same file name in a project agreed in casing, now defaults to `true`.
This can help catch differences issues with code written on case-insensitive file systems.

# TypeScript 4.9

 

## The `satisfies` Operator

TypeScript developers are often faced with a dilemma: we want to ensure that some expression matches some type, but also want to keep the most specific type of that expression for inference purposes.

For example:



```id
ts// Each property can be a string or an RGB tuple.const palette = {    red: [255, 0, 0],    green: "#00ff00",    bleu: [0, 0, 255]//  ^^^^ sacrebleu - we've made a typo!};// We want to be able to use string methods on 'green'...const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```



Notice that we’ve written `bleu`, whereas we probably should have written `blue`.
We could try to catch that `bleu` typo by using a type annotation on `palette`, but we’d lose the information about each property.



```id
tstype Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];const palette: Record<Colors, string | RGB> = {    red: [255, 0, 0],    green: "#00ff00",    bleu: [0, 0, 255]//  ~~~~ The typo is now correctly detected};// But we now have an undesirable error here - 'palette.green' "could" be of type RGB and// property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | RGB'.const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```



The new `satisfies` operator lets us validate that the type of an expression matches some type, without changing the resulting type of that expression.
As an example, we could use `satisfies` to validate that all the properties of `palette` are compatible with `string | number[]`:



```id
tstype Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];const palette = {    red: [255, 0, 0],    green: "#00ff00",    bleu: [0, 0, 255]//  ~~~~ The typo is now caught!} satisfies Record<Colors, string | RGB>;// toUpperCase() method is still accessible!const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```



`satisfies` can be used to catch lots of possible errors.
For example, we could ensure that an object has all the keys of some type, but no more:



```id
tstype Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";// Ensure that we have exactly the keys from 'Colors'.const favoriteColors = {    "red": "yes",    "green": false,    "blue": "kinda",    "platypus": false//  ~~~~~~~~~~ error - "platypus" was never listed in 'Colors'.} satisfies Record<Colors, unknown>;// All the information about the 'red', 'green', and 'blue' properties are retained.const g: boolean = favoriteColors.green;
```



Maybe we don’t care about if the property names match up somehow, but we do care about the types of each property.
In that case, we can also ensure that all of an object’s property values conform to some type.



```id
tstype RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];const palette = {    red: [255, 0, 0],    green: "#00ff00",    blue: [0, 0]    //    ~~~~~~ error!} satisfies Record<string, string | RGB>;// Information about each property is still maintained.const redComponent = palette.red.at(0);const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```



For more examples, you can see the issue proposing this and the implementing pull request .
We’d like to thank Oleksandr Tarasiuk who implemented and iterated on this feature with us.

## Unlisted Property Narrowing with the `in` Operator

As developers, we often need to deal with values that aren’t fully known at runtime.
In fact, we often don’t know if properties exist, whether we’re getting a response from a server or reading a configuration file.
JavaScript’s `in` operator can check whether a property
exists on an object.

Previously, TypeScript allowed us to narrow away any types that don’t explicitly list a property.



```id
tsinterface RGB {    red: number;    green: number;    blue: number;}interface HSV {    hue: number;    saturation: number;    value: number;}function setColor(color: RGB | HSV) {    if ("hue" in color) {        // 'color' now has the type HSV    }    // ...}
```



Here, the type `RGB` didn’t list the `hue` and got narrowed away, and leaving us with the type `HSV`.

But what about examples where no type listed a given property?
In those cases, the language didn’t help us much.
Let’s take the following example in JavaScript:



```id
jsfunction tryGetPackageName(context) {    const packageJSON = context.packageJSON;    // Check to see if we have an object.    if (packageJSON && typeof packageJSON === "object") {        // Check to see if it has a string name property.        if ("name" in packageJSON && typeof packageJSON.name === "string") {            return packageJSON.name;        }    }    return undefined;}
```



Rewriting this to canonical TypeScript would just be a matter of defining and using a type for `context`;
however, picking a safe type like `unknown` for the `packageJSON` property would cause issues in older versions of TypeScript.



```id
tsinterface Context {    packageJSON: unknown;}function tryGetPackageName(context: Context) {    const packageJSON = context.packageJSON;    // Check to see if we have an object.    if (packageJSON && typeof packageJSON === "object") {        // Check to see if it has a string name property.        if ("name" in packageJSON && typeof packageJSON.name === "string") {        //                                              ~~~~        // error! Property 'name' does not exist on type 'object.            return packageJSON.name;        //                     ~~~~        // error! Property 'name' does not exist on type 'object.        }    }    return undefined;}
```



This is because while the type of `packageJSON` was narrowed from `unknown` to `object`, the `in` operator strictly narrowed to types that actually defined the property being checked.
As a result, the type of `packageJSON` remained `object`.

TypeScript 4.9 makes the `in` operator a little bit more powerful when narrowing types that don’t list the property at all.
Instead of leaving them as-is, the language will intersect their types with `Record `.

So in our example, `packageJSON` will have its type narrowed from `unknown` to `object` to `object & Record `
That allows us to access `packageJSON.name` directly and narrow that independently.



```id
tsinterface Context {    packageJSON: unknown;}function tryGetPackageName(context: Context): string | undefined {    const packageJSON = context.packageJSON;    // Check to see if we have an object.    if (packageJSON && typeof packageJSON === "object") {        // Check to see if it has a string name property.        if ("name" in packageJSON && typeof packageJSON.name === "string") {            // Just works!            return packageJSON.name;        }    }    return undefined;}
```



TypeScript 4.9 also tightens up a few checks around how `in` is used, ensuring that the left side is assignable to the type `string | number | symbol`, and the right side is assignable to `object`.
This helps check that we’re using valid property keys, and not accidentally checking primitives.

For more information, read the implementing pull request 

## Auto-Accessors in Classes

TypeScript 4.9 supports an upcoming feature in ECMAScript called auto-accessors.
Auto-accessors are declared just like properties on classes, except that they’re declared with the `accessor` keyword.



```id
tsclass Person {    accessor name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }}
```



Under the covers, these auto-accessors “de-sugar” to a `get` and `set` accessor with an unreachable private property.



```id
tsclass Person {    #__name: string;    get name() {        return this.#__name;    }    set name(value: string) {        this.#__name = value;    }    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }}
```



You can read up more about the auto-accessors pull request on the original PR .

## Checks For Equality on `NaN`

A major gotcha for JavaScript developers is checking against the value `NaN` using the built-in equality operators.

For some background, `NaN` is a special numeric value that stands for “Not a Number”.
Nothing is ever equal to `NaN` - even `NaN`!



```id
jsconsole.log(NaN == 0)  // falseconsole.log(NaN === 0) // falseconsole.log(NaN == NaN)  // falseconsole.log(NaN === NaN) // false
```



But at least symmetrically everything is always not-equal to `NaN`.



```id
jsconsole.log(NaN != 0)  // trueconsole.log(NaN !== 0) // trueconsole.log(NaN != NaN)  // trueconsole.log(NaN !== NaN) // true
```



This technically isn’t a JavaScript-specific problem, since any language that contains IEEE-754 floats has the same behavior;
but JavaScript’s primary numeric type is a floating point number, and number parsing in JavaScript can often result in `NaN`.
In turn, checking against `NaN` ends up being fairly common, and the correct way to do so is to use `Number.isNaN` - but as we mentioned, lots of people accidentally end up checking with `someValue === NaN` instead.

TypeScript now errors on direct comparisons against `NaN`, and will suggest using some variation of `Number.isNaN` instead.



```id
tsfunction validate(someValue: number) {    return someValue !== NaN;    //     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    // error: This condition will always return 'true'.    //        Did you mean '!Number.isNaN(someValue)'?}
```



We believe that this change should strictly help catch beginner errors, similar to how TypeScript currently issues errors on comparisons against object and array literals.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk who contributed this check .

## File-Watching Now Uses File System Events

In earlier versions, TypeScript leaned heavily on polling for watching individual files.
Using a polling strategy meant checking the state of a file periodically for updates.
On Node.js, `fs.watchFile` is the built-in way to get a polling file-watcher.
While polling tends to be more predictable across platforms and file systems, it means that your CPU has to periodically get interrupted and check for updates to the file, even when nothing’s changed.
For a few dozen files, this might not be noticeable;
but on a bigger project with lots of files - or lots of files in `node_modules` - this can become a resource hog.

Generally speaking, a better approach is to use file system events.
Instead of polling, we can announce that we’re interested in updates of specific files and provide a callback for when those files actually do change.
Most modern platforms in use provide facilities and APIs like `CreateIoCompletionPort`, `kqueue`, `epoll`, and `inotify`.
Node.js mostly abstracts these away by providing `fs.watch` .
File system events usually work great, but there are lots of caveats to using them, and in turn, to using the `fs.watch` API.
A watcher needs to be careful to consider inode watching , unavailability on certain file systems (e.g.networked file systems), whether recursive file watching is available, whether directory renames trigger events, and even file watcher exhaustion!
In other words, it’s not quite a free lunch, especially if you’re looking for something cross-platform.

As a result, our default was to pick the lowest common denominator: polling.
Not always, but most of the time.

Over time, we’ve provided the means to choose other file-watching strategies .
This allowed us to get feedback and harden our file-watching implementation against most of these platform-specific gotchas.
As TypeScript has needed to scale to larger codebases, and has improved in this area, we felt swapping to file system events as the default would be a worthwhile investment.

In TypeScript 4.9, file watching is powered by file system events by default, only falling back to polling if we fail to set up event-based watchers.
For most developers, this should provide a much less resource-intensive experience when running in `--watch` mode, or running with a TypeScript-powered editor like Visual Studio or VS Code.

 The way file-watching works can still be configured through environment variables and `watchOptions` - and some editors like VS Code can support `watchOptions` independently .
Developers using more exotic set-ups where source code resides on a networked file systems (like NFS and SMB) may need to opt back into the older behavior; though if a server has reasonable processing power, it might just be better to enable SSH and run TypeScript remotely so that it has direct local file access.
VS Code has plenty of remote extensions to make this easier.

You can read up more on this change on GitHub .

## “Remove Unused Imports” and “Sort Imports” Commands for Editors

Previously, TypeScript only supported two editor commands to manage imports.
For our examples, take the following code:



```id
tsimport { Zebra, Moose, HoneyBadger } from "./zoo";import { foo, bar } from "./helper";let x: Moose | HoneyBadger = foo();
```



The first was called “Organize Imports” which would remove unused imports, and then sort the remaining ones.
It would rewrite that file to look like this one:



```id
tsimport { foo } from "./helper";import { HoneyBadger, Moose } from "./zoo";let x: Moose | HoneyBadger = foo();
```



In TypeScript 4.3, we introduced a command called “Sort Imports” which would only sort imports in the file, but not remove them - and would rewrite the file like this.



```id
tsimport { bar, foo } from "./helper";import { HoneyBadger, Moose, Zebra } from "./zoo";let x: Moose | HoneyBadger = foo();
```



The caveat with “Sort Imports” was that in Visual Studio Code, this feature was only available as an on-save command - not as a manually triggerable command.

TypeScript 4.9 adds the other half, and now provides “Remove Unused Imports”.
TypeScript will now remove unused import names and statements, but will otherwise leave the relative ordering alone.



```id
tsimport { Moose, HoneyBadger } from "./zoo";import { foo } from "./helper";let x: Moose | HoneyBadger = foo();
```



This feature is available to all editors that wish to use either command;
but notably, Visual Studio Code (1.73 and later) will have support built in and will surface these commands via its Command Palette.
Users who prefer to use the more granular “Remove Unused Imports” or “Sort Imports” commands should be able to reassign the “Organize Imports” key combination to them if desired.

You can view specifics of the feature here .

## Go-to-Definition on `return` Keywords

In the editor, when running a go-to-definition on the `return` keyword, TypeScript will now jump you to the top of the corresponding function.
This can be helpful to get a quick sense of which function a `return` belongs to.

We expect TypeScript will expand this functionality to more keywords such as `await` and `yield` or `switch`, `case`, and `default` .

 This feature was implemented thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk .

## Performance Improvements

TypeScript has a few small, but notable, performance improvements.

First, TypeScript’s `forEachChild` function has been rewritten to use a function table lookup instead of a `switch` statement across all syntax nodes.
`forEachChild` is a workhorse for traversing syntax nodes in the compiler, and is used heavily in the binding stage of our compiler, along with parts of the language service.
The refactoring of `forEachChild` yielded up to a 20% reduction of time spent in our binding phase and across language service operations.

Once we discovered this performance win for `forEachChild`, we tried it out on `visitEachChild`, a function we use for transforming nodes in the compiler and language service.
The same refactoring yielded up to a 3% reduction in time spent in generating project output.

The initial exploration in `forEachChild` was inspired by a blog post by Artemis Everfree .
While we have some reason to believe the root cause of our speed-up might have more to do with function size/complexity than the issues described in the blog post, we’re grateful that we were able to learn from the experience and try out a relatively quick refactoring that made TypeScript faster.

Finally, the way TypeScript preserves the information about a type in the true branch of a conditional type has been optimized.
In a type like



```id
tsinterface Zoo<T extends Animal> {    // ...}type MakeZoo<A> = A extends Animal ? Zoo<A> : never;
```



TypeScript has to “remember” that `A` must also be an `Animal` when checking if `Zoo ` is valid.
This is basically done by creating a special type that used to hold the intersection of `A` with `Animal`;
however, TypeScript previously did this eagerly which isn’t always necessary.
Furthermore, some faulty code in our type-checker prevented these special types from being simplified.
TypeScript now defers intersecting these types until it’s necessary.
For codebases with heavy use of conditional types, you might witness significant speed-ups with TypeScript, but in our performance testing suite, we saw a more modest 3% reduction in type-checking time.

You can read up more on these optimizations on their respective pull requests:

 `forEachChild` as a jump-table 

- `visitEachChild` as a jump-table 

- Optimize substitition types 

## Correctness Fixes and Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Updates

While TypeScript strives to avoid major breaks, even small changes in the built-in libraries can cause issues.
We don’t expect major breaks as a result of DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates, but there may be some small ones.

### Better Types for `Promise.resolve`

`Promise.resolve` now uses the `Awaited` type to unwrap Promise-like types passed to it.
This means that it more often returns the right `Promise` type, but that improved type can break existing code if it was expecting `any` or `unknown` instead of a `Promise`.
For more information, see the original change .

### JavaScript Emit No Longer Elides Imports

When TypeScript first supported type-checking and compilation for JavaScript, it accidentally supported a feature called import elision.
In short, if an import is not used as a value, or the compiler can detect that the import doesn’t refer to a value at runtime, the compiler will drop the import during emit.

This behavior was questionable, especially the detection of whether the import doesn’t refer to a value, since it means that TypeScript has to trust sometimes-inaccurate declaration files.
In turn, TypeScript now preserves imports in JavaScript files.



```id
js// Input:import { someValue, SomeClass } from "some-module";/** @type {SomeClass} */let val = someValue;// Previous Output:import { someValue } from "some-module";/** @type {SomeClass} */let val = someValue;// Current Output:import { someValue, SomeClass } from "some-module";/** @type {SomeClass} */let val = someValue;
```



More information is available at the implementing change .

### `exports` is Prioritized Over `typesVersions`

Previously, TypeScript incorrectly prioritized the `typesVersions` field over the `exports` field when resolving through a `package.json` under `--moduleResolution node16`.
If this change impacts your library, you may need to add `types@` version selectors in your `package.json`’s `exports` field.



```id
diff  {      "type": "module",      "main": "./dist/main.js"      "typesVersions": {          "<4.8": { ".": ["4.8-types/main.d.ts"] },          "*": { ".": ["modern-types/main.d.ts"] }      },      "exports": {          ".": {+             "types@<4.8": "./4.8-types/main.d.ts",+             "types": "./modern-types/main.d.ts",              "import": "./dist/main.js"          }      }  }
```

## `substitute` Replaced With `constraint` on `SubstitutionType`s

As part of an optimization on substitution types, `SubstitutionType` objects no longer contain the `substitute` property representing the effective substitution (usually an intersection of the base type and the implicit constraint) - instead, they just contain the `constraint` property.

# TypeScript 5.6

 

## Disallowed Nullish and Truthy Checks

Maybe you’ve written a regex and forgotten to call `.test(...)` on it:



```id
tsif (/0x[0-9a-f]/) {    // Oops! This block always runs.    // ...}
```



or maybe you’ve accidentally written `=>` (which creates an arrow function) instead of `>=` (the greater-than-or-equal-to operator):



```id
tsif (x => 0) {    // Oops! This block always runs.    // ...}
```



or maybe you’ve tried to use a default value with `??`, but mixed up the precedence of `??` and a comparison operator like ` many bugs could be caught from flagging down suspicious examples like above.
In TypeScript 5.6, the compiler now errors when it can syntactically determine a truthy or nullish check will always evaluate in a specific way.
So in the above examples, you’ll start to see errors:



```id
tsif (/0x[0-9a-f]/) {//  ~~~~~~~~~~~~// error: This kind of expression is always truthy.}if (x => 0) {//  ~~~~~~// error: This kind of expression is always truthy.}function isValid(value: string | number, options: any, strictness: "strict" | "loose") {    if (strictness === "loose") {        value = +value    }    return value < options.max ?? 100;    //     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    // error: Right operand of ?? is unreachable because the left operand is never nullish.}if (    isValid(primaryValue, "strict") || isValid(secondaryValue, "strict") ||    isValid(primaryValue, "loose" || isValid(secondaryValue, "loose"))) {    //                    ~~~~~~~    // error: This kind of expression is always truthy.}
```



Similar results can be achieved by enabling the ESLint `no-constant-binary-expression` rule, and you can see some of the results they achieved in their blog post ;
but the new checks TypeScript performs does not have perfect overlap with the ESLint rule, and we also believe there is a lot of value in having these checks built into TypeScript itself.

Note that certain expressions are still allowed, even if they are always truthy or nullish.
Specifically, `true`, `false`, `0`, and `1` are all still allowed despite always being truthy or falsy, since code like the following:



```id
tswhile (true) {    doStuff();    if (something()) {        break;    }    doOtherStuff();}
```



is still idiomatic and useful, and code like the following:



```id
tsif (true || inDebuggingOrDevelopmentEnvironment()) {    // ...}
```



is useful while iterating/debugging code.

If you’re curious about the implementation or the sorts of bugs it catches, take a look at the pull request that implemented this feature .

## Iterator Helper Methods

JavaScript has a notion of iterables (things which we can iterate over by calling a `[Symbol.iterator]()` and getting an iterator) and iterators (things which have a `next()` method which we can call to try to get the next value as we iterate).
By and large, you don’t typically have to think about these things when you toss them into a `for`/`of` loop, or `[...spread]` them into a new array.
But TypeScript does model these with the types `Iterable` and `Iterator` (and even `IterableIterator` which acts as both!), and these types describe the minimal set of members you need for constructs like `for`/`of` to work on them.

`Iterable`s (and `IterableIterator`s) are nice because they can be used in all sorts of places in JavaScript - but a lot of people found themselves missing methods on `Array`s like `map`, `filter`, and for some reason `reduce`.
That’s why a recent proposal was brought forward in ECMAScript to add many methods (and more) from `Array` onto most of the `IterableIterator`s that are produced in JavaScript.

For example, every generator now produces an object that also has a `map` method and a `take` method.



```id
tsfunction* positiveIntegers() {    let i = 1;    while (true) {        yield i;        i++;    }}const evenNumbers = positiveIntegers().map(x => x * 2);// Output://    2//    4//    6//    8//   10for (const value of evenNumbers.take(5)) {    console.log(value);}
```



The same is true for methods like `keys()`, `values()`, and `entries()` on `Map`s and `Set`s.



```id
tsfunction invertKeysAndValues<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>): Map<V, K> {    return new Map(        map.entries().map(([k, v]) => [v, k])    );}
```



You can also extend the new `Iterator` object:



```id
ts/** * Provides an endless stream of `0`s. */class Zeroes extends Iterator<number> {    next() {        return { value: 0, done: false } as const;    }}const zeroes = new Zeroes();// Transform into an endless stream of `1`s.const ones = zeroes.map(x => x + 1);
```



And you can adapt any existing `Iterable`s or `Iterator`s into this new type with `Iterator.from`:



```id
tsIterator.from(...).filter(someFunction);
```



Now, we have to talk about naming.

Earlier we mentioned that TypeScript has types for `Iterable` and `Iterator`;
however, like we mentioned, these act sort of like “protocols” to ensure certain operations work.
 That means that not every value that is declared `Iterable` or `Iterator` in TypeScript will have those methods we mentioned above. 

But there is still a new runtime value called `Iterator`.
You can reference `Iterator`, as well as `Iterator.prototype`, as actual values in JavaScript.
This is a bit awkward since TypeScript already defines its own thing called `Iterator` purely for type-checking.
So due to this unfortunate name clash, TypeScript needs to introduce a separate type to describe these native/built-in iterable iterators.

TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new type called `IteratorObject`.
It is defined as follows:



```id
tsinterface IteratorObject<T, TReturn = unknown, TNext = unknown> extends Iterator<T, TReturn, TNext> {    [Symbol.iterator](): IteratorObject<T, TReturn, TNext>;}
```



Lots of built-in collections and methods produce subtypes of `IteratorObject`s (like `ArrayIterator`, `SetIterator`, `MapIterator`, and more), and both the core JavaScript and DOM types in `lib.d.ts`, along with `@types/node`, have been updated to use this new type.

Similarly, there is a `AsyncIteratorObject` type for parity.
`AsyncIterator` does not yet exist as a runtime value in JavaScript that brings the same methods for `AsyncIterable`s, but it is an active proposal and this new type prepares for it.

We’d like to thank Kevin Gibbons who contributed the changes for these types , and who is one of the co-authors of the proposal .

## Strict Builtin Iterator Checks (and `--strictBuiltinIteratorReturn`)

When you call the `next()` method on an `Iterator `, it returns an object with a `value` and a `done` property.
This is modeled with the type `IteratorResult`.



```id
tstype IteratorResult<T, TReturn = any> = IteratorYieldResult<T> | IteratorReturnResult<TReturn>;interface IteratorYieldResult<TYield> {    done?: false;    value: TYield;}interface IteratorReturnResult<TReturn> {    done: true;    value: TReturn;}
```



The naming here is inspired by the way a generator function works.
Generator functions can `yield` values, and then `return` a final value - but the types between the two can be unrelated.



```id
tsfunction abc123() {    yield "a";    yield "b";    yield "c";    return 123;}const iter = abc123();iter.next(); // { value: "a", done: false }iter.next(); // { value: "b", done: false }iter.next(); // { value: "c", done: false }iter.next(); // { value: 123, done: true }
```



With the new `IteratorObject` type, we discovered some difficulties in allowing safe implementations of `IteratorObject`s.
At the same time, there’s been a long standing unsafety with `IteratorResult` in cases where `TReturn` was `any` (the default!).
For example, let’s say we have an `IteratorResult `.
If we end up reaching for the `value` of this type, we’ll end up with `string | any`, which is just `any`.



```id
tsfunction* uppercase(iter: Iterator<string, any>) {    while (true) {        const { value, done } = iter.next();        yield value.toUppercase(); // oops! forgot to check for `done` first and misspelled `toUpperCase`        if (done) {            return;        }    }}
```



It would be hard to fix this on every `Iterator` today without introducing a lot of breaks, but we can at least fix it with most `IteratorObject`s that get created.

TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new intrinsic type called `BuiltinIteratorReturn` and a new `--strict`-mode flag called `--strictBuiltinIteratorReturn`.
Whenever `IteratorObject`s are used in places like `lib.d.ts`, they are always written with `BuiltinIteratorReturn` type for `TReturn` (though you’ll see the more-specific `MapIterator`, `ArrayIterator`, `SetIterator` more often).



```id
tsinterface MapIterator<T> extends IteratorObject<T, BuiltinIteratorReturn, unknown> {    [Symbol.iterator](): MapIterator<T>;}// ...interface Map<K, V> {    // ...    /**     * Returns an iterable of key, value pairs for every entry in the map.     */    entries(): MapIterator<[K, V]>;    /**     * Returns an iterable of keys in the map     */    keys(): MapIterator<K>;    /**     * Returns an iterable of values in the map     */    values(): MapIterator<V>;}
```



By default, `BuiltinIteratorReturn` is `any`, but when `--strictBuiltinIteratorReturn` is enabled (possibly via `--strict`), it is `undefined`.
Under this new mode, if we use `BuiltinIteratorReturn`, our earlier example now correctly errors:



```id
tsfunction* uppercase(iter: Iterator<string, BuiltinIteratorReturn>) {    while (true) {        const { value, done } = iter.next();        yield value.toUppercase();        //    ~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~        // error! ┃      ┃        //        ┃      ┗━ Property 'toUppercase' does not exist on type 'string'. Did you mean 'toUpperCase'?        //        ┃        //        ┗━ 'value' is possibly 'undefined'.        if (done) {            return;        }    }}
```



You’ll typically see `BuiltinIteratorReturn` paired up with `IteratorObject` throughout `lib.d.ts`.
In general, we recommend being more explicit around the `TReturn` in your own code when possible.

For more information, you can read up on the feature here .

## Support for Arbitrary Module Identifiers

JavaScript allows modules to export bindings with invalid identifier names as string literals:



```id
tsconst banana = "🍌";export { banana as "🍌" };
```



Likewise, it allows modules to grab imports with these arbitrary names and bind them to valid identifiers:



```id
tsimport { "🍌" as banana } from "./foo"/** * om nom nom */function eat(food: string) {    console.log("Eating", food);};eat(banana);
```



This seems like a cute party trick (if you’re as fun as we are at parties), but it has its uses for interoperability with other languages (typically via JavaScript/WebAssembly boundaries), since other languages may have different rules for what constitutes a valid identifier.
It can also be useful for tools that generate code, like esbuild with its `inject` feature .

TypeScript 5.6 now allows you to use these arbitrary module identifiers in your code!
We’d like to thank Evan Wallace who contributed this change to TypeScript !

## The `--noUncheckedSideEffectImports` Option

In JavaScript it’s possible to `import` a module without actually importing any values from it.



```id
tsimport "some-module";
```



These imports are often called side effect imports because the only useful behavior they can provide is by executing some side effect (like registering a global variable, or adding a polyfill to a prototype).

In TypeScript, this syntax has had a pretty strange quirk: if the `import` could be resolved to a valid source file, then TypeScript would load and check the file.
On the other hand, if no source file could be found, TypeScript would silently ignore the `import`!

This is surprising behavior, but it partially stems from modeling patterns in the JavaScript ecosystem.
For example, this syntax has also been used with special loaders in bundlers to load CSS or other assets.
Your bundler might be configured in such a way where you can include specific `.css` files by writing something like the following:



```id
tsximport "./button-component.css";export function Button() {    // ...}
```



Still, this masks potential typos on side effect imports.
That’s why TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new compiler option called `--noUncheckedSideEffectImports`, to catch these cases.
When `--noUncheckedSideEffectImports` is enabled, TypeScript will now error if it can’t find a source file for a side effect import.



```id
tsimport "oops-this-module-does-not-exist";//     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// error: Cannot find module 'oops-this-module-does-not-exist' or its corresponding type declarations.
```



When enabling this option, some working code may now receive an error, like in the CSS example above.
To work around this, users who want to just write side effect `import`s for assets might be better served by writing what’s called an ambient module declaration with a wildcard specifier.
It would go in a global file and look something like the following:



```id
ts// ./src/globals.d.ts// Recognize all CSS files as module imports.declare module "*.css" {}
```



In fact, you might already have a file like this in your project!
For example, running something like `vite init` might create a similar `vite-env.d.ts`.

While this option is currently off by default, we encourage users to give it a try!

For more information, check out the implementation here .

## The `--noCheck` Option

TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new compiler option, `--noCheck`, which allows you to skip type checking for all input files.
This avoids unnecessary type-checking when performing any semantic analysis necessary for emitting output files.

One scenario for this is to separate JavaScript file generation from type-checking so that the two can be run as separate phases.
For example, you could run `tsc --noCheck` while iterating, and then `tsc --noEmit` for a thorough type check.
You could also run the two tasks in parallel, even in `--watch` mode, though note you’d probably want to specify a separate `--tsBuildInfoFile` path if you’re truly running them at the same time.

`--noCheck` is also useful for emitting declaration files in a similar fashion.
In a project where `--noCheck` is specified on a project that conforms to `--isolatedDeclarations`, TypeScript can quickly generate declaration files without a type-checking pass.
The generated declaration files will rely purely on quick syntactic transformations.

Note that in cases where `--noCheck` is specified, but a project does not use `--isolatedDeclarations`, TypeScript may still perform as much type-checking as necessary to generate `.d.ts` files.
In this sense, `--noCheck` is a bit of a misnomer; however, the process will be lazier than a full type-check, only calculating the types of unannotated declarations.
This should be much faster than a full type-check.

`noCheck` is also available via the TypeScript API as a standard option.
Internally, `transpileModule` and `transpileDeclaration` already used `noCheck` to speed things up (at least as of TypeScript 5.5).
Now any build tool should be able to leverage the flag, taking a variety of custom strategies to coordinate and speed up builds.

For more information, see the work done in TypeScript 5.5 to power up `noCheck` internally , along with the relevant work to make it publicly available on the command line and

## Allow `--build` with Intermediate Errors

TypeScript’s concept of project references allows you to organize your codebase into multiple projects and create dependencies between them.
Running the TypeScript compiler in `--build` mode (or `tsc -b` for short) is the built-in way of actually conducting that build across projects and figuring out which projects and files need to be compiled.

Previously, using `--build` mode would assume `--noEmitOnError` and immediately stop the build if any errors were encountered.
This meant that “downstream” projects could never be checked and built if any of their “upstream” dependencies had build errors.
In theory, this is a very cromulent approach - if a project has errors, it is not necessarily in a coherent state for its dependencies.

In reality, this sort of rigidity made things like upgrades a pain.
For example, if `projectB` depends on `projectA`, then people more familiar with `projectB` can’t proactively upgrade their code until their dependencies are upgraded.
They are blocked by work on upgrading `projectA` first.

As of TypeScript 5.6, `--build` mode will continue to build projects even if there are intermediate errors in dependencies.
In the face of intermediate errors, they will be reported consistently and output files will be generated on a best-effort basis;
however, the build will continue to completion on the specified project.

If you want to stop the build on the first project with errors, you can use a new flag called `--stopOnBuildErrors`.
This can be useful when running in a CI environment, or when iterating on a project that’s heavily depended upon by other projects.

Note that to accomplish this, TypeScript now always emits a `.tsbuildinfo` file for any project in a `--build` invocation (even if `--incremental`/`--composite` is not specified).
This is to keep track of the state of how `--build` was invoked and what work needs to be performed in the future.

You can read more about this change here on the implementation .

## Region-Prioritized Diagnostics in Editors

When TypeScript’s language service is asked for the diagnostics for a file (things like errors, suggestions, and deprecations), it would typically require checking the entire file .
Most of the time this is fine, but in extremely large files it can incur a delay.
That can be frustrating because fixing a typo should feel like a quick operation, but can take seconds in a big-enough file.

To address this, TypeScript 5.6 introduces a new feature called region-prioritized diagnostics or region-prioritized checking .
Instead of just requesting diagnostics for a set of files, editors can now also provide a relevant region of a given file - and the intent is that this will typically be the region of the file that is currently visible to a user.
The TypeScript language server can then choose to provide two sets of diagnostics: one for the region, and one for the file in its entirety.
This allows editing to feel way more responsive in large files so you’re not waiting as long for thoes red squiggles to disappear.

For some specific numbers, in our testing on TypeScript’s own `checker.ts` , a full semantic diagnostics response took 3330ms.
In contrast, the response for the first region-based diagnostics response took 143ms!
While the remaining whole-file response took about 3200ms, this can make a huge difference for quick edits.

This feature also includes quite a bit of work to also make diagnostics report more consistently throughout your experience.
Due the way our type-checker leverages caching to avoid work, subsequent checks between the same types could often have a different (typically shorter) error message.
Technically, lazy out-of-order checking could cause diagnostics to report differently between two locations in an editor - even before this feature - but we didn’t want to exacerbate the issue.
With recent work, we’ve ironed out many of these error inconsistencies.

Currently, this functionality is available in Visual Studio Code for TypeScript 5.6 and later.

For more detailed information, take a look at the implementation and write-up here .

## Granular Commit Characters

TypeScript’s language service now provides its own commit characters for each completion item.
Commit characters are specific characters that, when typed, will automatically commit the currently-suggested completion item.

What this means is that over time your editor will now more frequently commit to the currently-suggested completion item when you type certain characters.
For example, take the following code:



```id
tsdeclare let food: {    eat(): any;}let f = (foo/**/
```



If our cursor is at `/**/`, it’s unclear if the code we’re writing is going to be something like `let f = (food.eat())` or `let f = (foo, bar) => foo + bar`.
You could imagine that the editor might be able to auto-complete differently depending on which character we type out next.
For instance, if we type in the period/dot character (`.`), we probably want the editor to complete with the variable `food`;
but if we type the comma character (`,`), we might be writing out a parameter in an arrow function.

Unfortunately, previously TypeScript just signaled to editors that the current text might define a new parameter name so that no commit characters were safe.
So hitting a `.` wouldn’t do anything even if it was “obvious” that the editor should auto-complete with the word `food`.

TypeScript now explicitly lists which characters are safe to commit for each completion item.
While this won’t immediately change your day-to-day experience, editors that support these commit characters should see behavioral improvements over time.
To see those improvements right now, you can now use the TypeScript nightly extension with Visual Studio Code Insiders .
Hitting `.` in the code above correctly auto-completes with `food`.

For more information, see the pull request that added commit characters along with our adjustments to commit characters depending on context .

## Exclude Patterns for Auto-Imports

TypeScript’s language service now allows you to specify a list of regular expression patterns which will filter away auto-import suggestions from certain specifiers.
For example, if you want to exclude all “deep” imports from a package like `lodash`, you could configure the following preference in Visual Studio Code:



```id
json{    "typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes": [        "^lodash/.*$"    ]}
```



Or going the other way, you might want to disallow importing from the entry-point of a package:



```id
json{    "typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes": [        "^lodash$"    ]}
```



One could even avoid `node:` imports by using the following setting:



```id
json{    "typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes": [        "^node:"    ]}
```



Note that if you want to specify certain flags like `i` or `u`, you will need to surround your regular expression with slashes.
When providing surrounding slashes, you’ll need to escape other inner slashes.



```id
json{    "typescript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes": [        "^./lib/internal",        // no escaping needed        "/^.\\/lib\\/internal/",  // escaping needed - note the leading and trailing slashes        "/^.\\/lib\\/internal/i"  // escaping needed - we needed slashes to provide the 'i' regex flag    ]}
```



In Visual Studio Code, the same settings can be applied for JavaScript through 

```
javascript.preferences.autoImportSpecifierExcludeRegexes
```

.

For more information, see the implementation here .

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### `lib.d.ts`

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see linked issues related to DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates for this version of TypeScript .

### `.tsbuildinfo` is Always Written

To enable `--build` to continue building projects even if there are intermediate errors in dependencies, and to support `--noCheck` on the command line, TypeScript now always emits a `.tsbuildinfo` file for any project in a `--build` invocation.
This happens regardless of whether `--incremental` is actually on.
 See more information here .

### Respecting File Extensions and `package.json` from within `node_modules`

Before Node.js implemented support for ECMAScript modules in v12, there was never a good way for TypeScript to know whether `.d.ts` files it found in `node_modules` represented JavaScript files authored as CommonJS or ECMAScript modules.
When the vast majority of npm was CommonJS-only, this didn’t cause many problems - if in doubt, TypeScript could just assume that everything behaved like CommonJS.
Unfortunately, if that assumption was wrong it could allow unsafe imports:



```id
ts// node_modules/dep/index.d.tsexport declare function doSomething(): void;// index.ts// Okay if "dep" is a CommonJS module, but fails if// it's an ECMAScript module - even in bundlers!import dep from "dep";dep.doSomething();
```



In practice, this didn’t come up very often.
But in the years since Node.js started supporting ECMAScript modules, the share of ESM on npm has grown.
Fortunately, Node.js also introduced a mechanism that can help TypeScript determine if a file is an ECMAScript module or a CommonJS module: the `.mjs` and `.cjs` file extensions and the `package.json` `"type"` field.
TypeScript 4.7 added support for understanding these indicators, as well as authoring `.mts` and `.cts` files;
however, TypeScript would only read those indicators under `--module node16` and `--module nodenext`, so the unsafe import above was still a problem for anyone using `--module esnext` and `--moduleResolution bundler`, for example.

To solve this, TypeScript 5.6 collects module format information and uses it to resolve ambiguities like the one in the example above in all `module` modes (except `amd`, `umd`, and `system`).
Format-specific file extensions (`.mts` and `.cts`) are respected anywhere they’re found, and the `package.json` `"type"` field is consulted inside `node_modules` dependencies, regardless of the `module` setting.
Previously, it was technically possible to produce CommonJS output into a `.mjs` file or vice versa:



```id
ts// main.mtsexport default "oops";// $ tsc --module commonjs main.mts// main.mjsObject.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });exports.default = "oops";
```



Now, `.mts` files never emit CommonJS output, and `.cts` files never emit ESM output.

Note that much of this behavior was provided in pre-release versions of TypeScript 5.5 ( implementation details here ), but in 5.6 this behavior is only extended to files within `node_modules`.

More details are available on the change here .

### Correct `override` Checks on Computed Properties

Previously, computed properties marked with `override` did not correctly check for the existence of a base class member.
Similarly, if you used `noImplicitOverride`, you would not get an error if you forgot to add an `override` modifier to a computed property.

TypeScript 5.6 now correctly checks computed properties in both cases.



```id
tsconst foo = Symbol("foo");const bar = Symbol("bar");class Base {    [bar]() {}}class Derived extends Base {    override [foo]() {}//           ~~~~~// error: This member cannot have an 'override' modifier because it is not declared in the base class 'Base'.    [bar]() {}//  ~~~~~// error under noImplicitOverride: This member must have an 'override' modifier because it overrides a member in the base class 'Base'.}
```

# TypeScript 4.8

 

## Improved Intersection Reduction, Union Compatibility, and Narrowing

TypeScript 4.8 brings a series of correctness and consistency improvements under `--strictNullChecks`.
These changes affect how intersection and union types work, and are leveraged in how TypeScript narrows types.

For example, `unknown` is close in spirit to the union type `{} | null | undefined` because it accepts `null`, `undefined`, and any other type.
TypeScript now recognizes this, and allows assignments from `unknown` to `{} | null | undefined`.



```id
tsfunction f(x: unknown, y: {} | null | undefined) {    x = y; // always worked    y = x; // used to error, now works}
```



Another change is that `{}` intersected with any other object type simplifies right down to that object type.
That meant that we were able to rewrite `NonNullable` to just use an intersection with `{}`, because `{} & null` and `{} & undefined` just get tossed away.



```id
diff- type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;+ type NonNullable<T> = T & {};
```



This is an improvement because intersection types like this can be reduced and assigned to, while conditional types currently cannot.
So `NonNullable >` now simplifies at least to `NonNullable `, whereas it didn’t before.



```id
tsfunction foo<T>(x: NonNullable<T>, y: NonNullable<NonNullable<T>>) {    x = y; // always worked    y = x; // used to error, now works}
```



These changes also allowed us to bring in sensible improvements in control flow analysis and type narrowing.
For example, `unknown` is now narrowed just like `{} | null | undefined` in truthy branches.



```id
tsfunction narrowUnknownishUnion(x: {} | null | undefined) {    if (x) {        x;  // {}    }    else {        x;  // {} | null | undefined    }}function narrowUnknown(x: unknown) {    if (x) {        x;  // used to be 'unknown', now '{}'    }    else {        x;  // unknown    }}
```



Generic values also get narrowed similarly.
When checking that a value isn’t `null` or `undefined`, TypeScript now just intersects it with `{}` - which again, is the same as saying it’s `NonNullable`.
Putting many of the changes here together, we can now define the following function without any type assertions.



```id
tsfunction throwIfNullable<T>(value: T): NonNullable<T> {    if (value === undefined || value === null) {        throw Error("Nullable value!");    }    // Used to fail because 'T' was not assignable to 'NonNullable<T>'.    // Now narrows to 'T & {}' and succeeds because that's just 'NonNullable<T>'.    return value;}
```



`value` now gets narrowed to `T & {}`, and is now identical with `NonNullable ` - so the body of the function just works with no TypeScript-specific syntax.

On their own, these changes may appear small - but they represent fixes for many many paper cuts that have been reported over several years.

For more specifics on these improvements, you can read more here .

## Improved Inference for `infer` Types in Template String Types

TypeScript recently introduced a way to add `extends` constraints to `infer` type variables in conditional types.



```id
ts// Grabs the first element of a tuple if it's assignable to 'number',// and returns 'never' if it can't find one.type TryGetNumberIfFirst<T> =    T extends [infer U extends number, ...unknown[]] ? U : never;
```



If these `infer` types appear in a template string type and are constrained to a primitive type, TypeScript will now try to parse out a literal type.



```id
ts// SomeNum used to be 'number'; now it's '100'.type SomeNum = "100" extends `${infer U extends number}` ? U : never;// SomeBigInt used to be 'bigint'; now it's '100n'.type SomeBigInt = "100" extends `${infer U extends bigint}` ? U : never;// SomeBool used to be 'boolean'; now it's 'true'.type SomeBool = "true" extends `${infer U extends boolean}` ? U : never;
```



This can now better convey what a library will do at runtime, and give more precise types.

One note on this is that when TypeScript parses these literal types out it will greedily try to parse out as much of what looks like of the appropriate primitive type;
however it then checks to see if the print-back of that primitive matches up with the string contents.
In other words, TypeScript checks whether the going from the string, to the primitive, and back matches.
If it doesn’t see that the string can be “round-tripped”, then it will fall back to the base primitive type.



```id
ts// JustNumber is `number` here because TypeScript parses out `"1.0"`, but `String(Number("1.0"))` is `"1"` and doesn't match.type JustNumber = "1.0" extends `${infer T extends number}` ? T : never;
```

## `--build`, `--watch`, and `--incremental` Performance Improvements

TypeScript 4.8 introduces several optimizations that should speed up scenarios around `--watch` and `--incremental`, along with project references builds using `--build`.
For example, TypeScript is now able to avoid spending time updating timestamps during no-op changes in `--watch` mode, which makes rebuilds faster and avoids messing with other build tools that might be watching for TypeScript’s output.
Many other optimizations where we’re able to reuse information across `--build`, `--watch`, and `--incremental` have been introduced as well.

How big are these improvements?
Well, on a fairly large internal codebase, we’ve seen time reductions on the order of 10%-25% on many simple common operations, with around 40% time reductions in no-change scenarios.
We’ve seen similar results on the TypeScript codebase as well.

You can see the changes, along with the performance results on GitHub .

## Errors When Comparing Object and Array Literals

In many languages, operators like `==` perform what’s called “value” equality on objects.
For example, in Python it’s valid to check whether a list is empty by checking whether a value is equal to the empty list using `==`.



```id
pyif people_at_home == []:    print("here's where I lie, broken inside. </3")    adopt_animals()
```



This is not the case in JavaScript, where `==` and `===` between objects (and therefore, arrays) check whether both references point to the same value.
We believe that similar code in JavaScript is at best an early foot-gun for JavaScript developers, and at worst a bug in production code.
That’s why TypeScript now disallows code like the following.



```id
tsif (peopleAtHome === []) {//  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// This condition will always return 'false' since JavaScript compares objects by reference, not value.    console.log("here's where I lie, broken inside. </3")    adoptAnimals();}
```



We’d like to extend our gratitude to Jack Works who contributed this check.

## Improved Inference from Binding Patterns

In some cases, TypeScript will pick up a type from a binding pattern to make better inferences.



```id
tsdeclare function chooseRandomly<T>(x: T, y: T): T;let [a, b, c] = chooseRandomly([42, true, "hi!"], [0, false, "bye!"]);//   ^  ^  ^//   |  |  |//   |  |  string//   |  |//   |  boolean//   |//   number
```



When `chooseRandomly` needs to figure out a type for `T`, it will primarily look at `[42, true, "hi!"]` and `[0, false, "bye!"]`;
but TypeScript needs to figure out whether those two types should be `Array ` or the tuple type `[number, boolean, string]`.
To do that, it will look for existing candidates as a hint to see whether there are any tuple types.
When TypeScript sees the binding pattern `[a, b, c]`, it creates the type `[any, any, any]`, and that type gets picked up as a low-priority candidate for `T` which also gets used as a hint for the types of `[42, true, "hi!"]` and `[0, false, "bye!"]`.

You can see how this was good for `chooseRandomly`, but it fell short in other cases.
For example, take the following code



```id
tsdeclare function f<T>(x?: T): T;let [x, y, z] = f();
```



The binding pattern `[x, y, z]` hinted that `f` should produce an `[any, any, any]` tuple;
but `f` really shouldn’t change its type argument based on a binding pattern.
It can’t suddenly conjure up a new array-like value based on what it’s being assigned to, so the binding pattern type has way too much influence on the produced type.
On top of that, because the binding pattern type is full of `any`s, we’re left with `x`, `y`, and `z` being typed as `any`.

In TypeScript 4.8, these binding patterns are never used as candidates for type arguments.
Instead, they’re just consulted in case a parameter needs a more specific type like in our `chooseRandomly` example.
If you need to revert to the old behavior, you can always provide explicit type arguments.

You can look at the change on GitHub if you’re curious to learn more.

## File-Watching Fixes (Especially Across `git checkout`s)

We’ve had a long-standing bug where TypeScript has a very hard time with certain file changes in `--watch` mode and editor scenarios.
Sometimes the symptoms are stale or inaccurate errors that might show up that require restarting `tsc` or VS Code.
Frequently these occur on Unix systems, and you might have seen these after saving a file with vim or swapping branches in git.

This was caused by assumptions of how Node.js handles rename events across file systems.
File systems used by Linux and macOS utilize inodes , and Node.js will attach file watchers to inodes rather than file paths .
So when Node.js returns a watcher object , it might be watching a path or an inode depending on the platform and file system.

To be a bit more efficient, TypeScript tries to reuse the same watcher objects if it detects a path still exists on disk.
This is where things went wrong, because even if a file still exists at that path, a distinct file might have been created, and that file will have a different inode.
So TypeScript would end up reusing the watcher object instead of installing a new watcher at the original location, and watch for changes at what might be a totally irrelevant file.
So TypeScript 4.8 now handles these cases on inode systems and properly installs a new watcher and fixes this.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Marc Celani and his team at Airtable who invested lots of time in investigating the issues they were experiencing and pointing out the root cause.
You can view the specific fixes around file-watching here .

## Find-All-References Performance Improvements

When running find-all-references in your editor, TypeScript is now able to act a little smarter as it aggregates references.
This reduced the amount of time TypeScript took to search a widely-used identifier in its own codebase by about 20%.

 You can read up more on the improvement here .

## Exclude Specific Files from Auto-Imports

TypeScript 4.8 introduces an editor preference for excluding files from auto-imports.
In Visual Studio Code, file names or globs can be added under “Auto Import File Exclude Patterns” in the Settings UI, or in a `.vscode/settings.json` file:



```id
jsonc{    // Note that `javascript.preferences.autoImportFileExcludePatterns` can be specified for JavaScript too.    "typescript.preferences.autoImportFileExcludePatterns": [      "**/node_modules/@types/node"    ]}
```



This can be useful in cases where you can’t avoid having certain modules or libraries in your compilation but you rarely want to import from them.
These modules might have lots of exports that can pollute the auto-imports list and make it harder to navigate, and this option can help in those situations.

You can see more specifics about the implementation here .

## Correctness Fixes and Breaking Changes

Due to the nature of type system changes, there are very few changes that can be made that don’t affect some code;
however, there are a few changes that are more likely to require adapting existing code.

### `lib.d.ts` Updates

While TypeScript strives to avoid major breaks, even small changes in the built-in libraries can cause issues.
We don’t expect major breaks as a result of DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates, but one notable change is that the `cause` property on `Error`s now has the type `unknown` instead of `Error`.

### Unconstrained Generics No Longer Assignable to `{}`

In TypeScript 4.8, for projects with `strictNullChecks` enabled, TypeScript will now correctly issue an error when an unconstrained type parameter is used in a position where `null` or `undefined` are not legal values.
That will include any type that expects `{}`, `object`, or an object type with all-optional properties.

A simple example can be seen in the following.



```id
ts// Accepts any non-null non-undefined valuefunction bar(value: {}) {  Object.keys(value); // This call throws on null/undefined at runtime.}// Unconstrained type parameter T...function foo<T>(x: T) {    bar(x); // Used to be allowed, now is an error in 4.8.    //  ~    // error: Argument of type 'T' is not assignable to parameter of type '{}'.}foo(undefined);
```



As demonstrated above, code like this has a potential bug - the values `null` and `undefined` can be indirectly passed through these unconstrained type parameters to code that is not supposed to observe those values.

This behavior will also be visible in type positions. One example would be:



```id
tsinterface Foo<T> {  x: Bar<T>;}interface Bar<T extends {}> { }
```



Existing code that didn’t want to handle `null` and `undefined` can be fixed by propagating the appropriate constraints through.



```id
diff- function foo<T>(x: T) {+ function foo<T extends {}>(x: T) {
```



Another work-around would be to check for `null` and `undefined` at runtime.



```id
diff  function foo<T>(x: T) {+     if (x !== null && x !== undefined) {          bar(x);+     }  }
```



And if you know that for some reason, your generic value can’t be `null` or `undefined`, you can just use a non-null assertion.



```id
diff  function foo<T>(x: T) {-     bar(x);+     bar(x!);  }
```



When it comes to types, you’ll often either need to propagate constraints, or intersect your types with `{}`.

For more information, you can see the change that introduced this along with the specific discussion issue regarding how unconstrained generics now work .

### Decorators are placed on `modifiers` on TypeScript’s Syntax Trees

The current direction of decorators in TC39 means that TypeScript will have to handle a break in terms of placement of decorators.
Previously, TypeScript assumed decorators would always be placed prior to all keywords/modifiers.
For example



```id
ts@decoratorexport class Foo {  // ...}
```



Decorators as currently proposed do not support this syntax.
Instead, the `export` keyword must precede the decorator.



```id
tsexport @decorator class Foo {  // ...}
```



Unfortunately, TypeScript’s trees are concrete rather than abstract , and our architecture expects syntax tree node fields to be entirely ordered before or after each other.
To support both legacy decorators and decorators as proposed, TypeScript will have to gracefully parse, and intersperse, modifiers and decorators.

To do this, it exposes a new type alias called `ModifierLike` which is a `Modifier` or a `Decorator`.



```id
tsexport type ModifierLike = Modifier | Decorator;
```



Decorators are now placed in the same field as `modifiers` which is now a `NodeArray ` when set, and the entire field is deprecated.



```id
diff- readonly modifiers?: NodeArray<Modifier> | undefined;+ /**+  * @deprecated ...+  * Use `ts.canHaveModifiers()` to test whether a `Node` can have modifiers.+  * Use `ts.getModifiers()` to get the modifiers of a `Node`.+  * ...+  */+ readonly modifiers?: NodeArray<ModifierLike> | undefined;
```



All existing `decorators` properties have been marked as deprecated and will always be `undefined` if read.
The type has also been changed to `undefined` so that existing tools know to handle them correctly.



```id
diff- readonly decorators?: NodeArray<Decorator> | undefined;+ /**+  * @deprecated ...+  * Use `ts.canHaveDecorators()` to test whether a `Node` can have decorators.+  * Use `ts.getDecorators()` to get the decorators of a `Node`.+  * ...+  */+ readonly decorators?: undefined;
```



To avoid new deprecation warnings and other issues, TypeScript now exposes four new functions to use in place of the `decorators` and `modifiers` properties.
There are individual predicates for testing whether a node has support modifiers and decorators, along with respective accessor functions for grabbing them.



```id
tsfunction canHaveModifiers(node: Node): node is HasModifiers;function getModifiers(node: HasModifiers): readonly Modifier[] | undefined;function canHaveDecorators(node: Node): node is HasDecorators;function getDecorators(node: HasDecorators): readonly Decorator[] | undefined;
```



As an example of how to access modifiers off of a node, you can write



```id
tsconst modifiers = canHaveModifiers(myNode) ? getModifiers(myNode) : undefined;
```



With the note that each call to `getModifiers` and `getDecorators` may allocate a new array.

### Types Cannot Be Imported/Exported in JavaScript Files

TypeScript previously allowed JavaScript files to import and export entities declared with a type, but no value, in `import` and `export` statements.
This behavior was incorrect, because named imports and exports for values that don’t exist will cause a runtime error under ECMAScript modules.
When a JavaScript file is type-checked under `--checkJs` or through a `// @ts-check` comment, TypeScript will now issue an error.



```id
ts// @ts-check// Will fail at runtime because 'SomeType' is not a value.import { someValue, SomeType } from "some-module";/** * @type {SomeType} */export const myValue = someValue;/** * @typedef {string | number} MyType */// Will fail at runtime because 'MyType' is not a value.export { MyType as MyExportedType };
```



To reference a type from another module, you can instead directly qualify the import.



```id
diff- import { someValue, SomeType } from "some-module";+ import { someValue } from "some-module";    /**-  * @type {SomeType}+  * @type {import("some-module").SomeType}   */  export const myValue = someValue;
```



To export a type, you can just use a `/** @typedef */` comment in JSDoc.
`@typedef` comments already automatically export types from their containing modules.



```id
diff  /**   * @typedef {string | number} MyType   */+ /**+  * @typedef {MyType} MyExportedType+  */- export { MyType as MyExportedType };
```



You can read more about the change here .

### Binding Patterns Do Not Directly Contribute to Inference Candidates

As mentioned above, binding patterns no longer change the type of inference results in function calls.
You can read more about the original change here .

### Unused Renames in Binding Patterns are Now Errors in Type Signatures

TypeScript’s type annotation syntax often looks like it can be used when destructuring values.
For example, take the following function.



```id
tsdeclare function makePerson({ name: string, age: number }): Person;
```



You might read this signature and think that `makePerson` obviously takes an object with a `name` property with the type `string` and an `age` property with the type `number`;
however, JavaScript’s destructuring syntax is actually taking precedence here.
`makePerson` does say that it’s going to take an object with a `name` and an `age` property, but instead of specifying a type for them, it’s just saying that it renames `name` and `age` to `string` and `number` respectively.

In a pure type construct, writing code like this is useless, and typically a mistake since developers usually assume they’re writing a type annotation.

TypeScript 4.8 makes these an error unless they’re referenced later in the signature.
The correct way to write the above signature would be as follows:



```id
tsdeclare function makePerson(options: { name: string, age: number }): Person;// ordeclare function makePerson({ name, age }: { name: string, age: number }): Person;
```



This change can catch bugs in declarations, and has been helpful for improving existing code.
We’d like to extend our thanks to GitHub user uhyo for providing this check.

# TypeScript 5.5

 

## Inferred Type Predicates

 This section was written by Dan Vanderkam , who implemented this feature in TypeScript 5.5 . Thanks Dan! 

TypeScript’s control flow analysis does a great job of tracking how the type of a variable changes as it moves through your code:



```id
tsxinterface Bird {    commonName: string;    scientificName: string;    sing(): void;}// Maps country names -> national bird.// Not all nations have official birds (looking at you, Canada!)declare const nationalBirds: Map<string, Bird>;function makeNationalBirdCall(country: string) {  const bird = nationalBirds.get(country);  // bird has a declared type of Bird | undefined  if (bird) {    bird.sing();  // bird has type Bird inside the if statement  } else {    // bird has type undefined here.  }}
```



By making you handle the `undefined` case, TypeScript pushes you to write more robust code.

In the past, this sort of type refinement was more difficult to apply to arrays. This would have been an error in all previous versions of TypeScript:



```id
tsxfunction makeBirdCalls(countries: string[]) {  // birds: (Bird | undefined)[]  const birds = countries    .map(country => nationalBirds.get(country))    .filter(bird => bird !== undefined);  for (const bird of birds) {    bird.sing();  // error: 'bird' is possibly 'undefined'.  }}
```



This code is perfectly fine: we’ve filtered all the `undefined` values out of the list.
But TypeScript hasn’t been able to follow along.

With TypeScript 5.5, the type checker is fine with this code:



```id
tsxfunction makeBirdCalls(countries: string[]) {  // birds: Bird[]  const birds = countries    .map(country => nationalBirds.get(country))    .filter(bird => bird !== undefined);  for (const bird of birds) {    bird.sing();  // ok!  }}
```



Note the more precise type for `birds`.

This works because TypeScript now infers a type predicate for the `filter` function.
You can see what’s going on more clearly by pulling it out into a standalone function:



```id
tsx// function isBirdReal(bird: Bird | undefined): bird is Birdfunction isBirdReal(bird: Bird | undefined) {  return bird !== undefined;}
```



`bird is Bird` is the type predicate.
It means that, if the function returns `true`, then it’s a `Bird` (if the function returns `false` then it’s `undefined`).
The type declarations for `Array.prototype.filter` know about type predicates, so the net result is that you get a more precise type and the code passes the type checker.

TypeScript will infer that a function returns a type predicate if these conditions hold:

 The function does not have an explicit return type or type predicate annotation.

- The function has a single `return` statement and no implicit returns.

- The function does not mutate its parameter.

- The function returns a `boolean` expression that’s tied to a refinement on the parameter.

Generally this works how you’d expect.
Here’s a few more examples of inferred type predicates:



```id
tsx// const isNumber: (x: unknown) => x is numberconst isNumber = (x: unknown) => typeof x === 'number';// const isNonNullish: <T>(x: T) => x is NonNullable<T>const isNonNullish = <T,>(x: T) => x != null;
```



Previously, TypeScript would have just inferred that these functions return `boolean`.
It now infers signatures with type predicates like `x is number` or `x is NonNullable `.

Type predicates have “if and only if” semantics.
If a function returns `x is T`, then it means that:

- If the function returns `true` then `x` has the type `T`.

- If the function returns `false` then `x` does not have type `T`.

If you’re expecting a type predicate to be inferred but it’s not, then you may be running afoul of the second rule. This often comes up with “truthiness” checks:



```id
tsxfunction getClassroomAverage(students: string[], allScores: Map<string, number>) {  const studentScores = students    .map(student => allScores.get(student))    .filter(score => !!score);  return studentScores.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / studentScores.length;  //     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  // error: Object is possibly 'undefined'.}
```



TypeScript did not infer a type predicate for `score => !!score`, and rightly so: if this returns `true` then `score` is a `number`.
But if it returns `false`, then `score` could be either `undefined` or a `number` (specifically, `0`).
This is a real bug: if any student got a zero on the test, then filtering out their score will skew the average upwards.
Fewer will be above average and more will be sad!

As with the first example, it’s better to explicitly filter out `undefined` values:



```id
tsxfunction getClassroomAverage(students: string[], allScores: Map<string, number>) {  const studentScores = students    .map(student => allScores.get(student))    .filter(score => score !== undefined);  return studentScores.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / studentScores.length;  // ok!}
```



A truthiness check will infer a type predicate for object types, where there’s no ambiguity.
Remember that functions must return a `boolean` to be a candidate for an inferred type predicate: `x => !!x` might infer a type predicate, but `x => x` definitely won’t.

Explicit type predicates continue to work exactly as before.
TypeScript will not check whether it would infer the same type predicate.
Explicit type predicates (“is”) are no safer than a type assertion (“as”).

It’s possible that this feature will break existing code if TypeScript now infers a more precise type than you want. For example:



```id
tsx// Previously, nums: (number | null)[]// Now, nums: number[]const nums = [1, 2, 3, null, 5].filter(x => x !== null);nums.push(null);  // ok in TS 5.4, error in TS 5.5
```



The fix is to tell TypeScript the type that you want using an explicit type annotation:



```id
tsxconst nums: (number | null)[] = [1, 2, 3, null, 5].filter(x => x !== null);nums.push(null);  // ok in all versions
```



For more information, check out the implementing pull request and Dan’s blog post about implementing this feature .

## Control Flow Narrowing for Constant Indexed Accesses

TypeScript is now able to narrow expressions of the form `obj[key]` when both `obj` and `key` are effectively constant.



```id
tsfunction f1(obj: Record<string, unknown>, key: string) {    if (typeof obj[key] === "string") {        // Now okay, previously was error        obj[key].toUpperCase();    }}
```



In the above, neither `obj` nor `key` are ever mutated, so TypeScript can narrow the type of `obj[key]` to `string` after the `typeof` check.
For more information, see the implementing pull request here .

## The JSDoc `@import` Tag

Today, if you want to import something only for type-checking in a JavaScript file, it is cumbersome.
JavaScript developers can’t simply import a type named `SomeType` if it’s not there at runtime.



```id
js// ./some-module.d.tsexport interface SomeType {    // ...}// ./index.jsimport { SomeType } from "./some-module"; // ❌ runtime error!/** * @param {SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



`SomeType` won’t exist at runtime, so the import will fail.
Developers can instead use a namespace import instead.



```id
jsimport * as someModule from "./some-module";/** * @param {someModule.SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



But `./some-module` is still imported at runtime - which might also not be desirable.

To avoid this, developers typically had to use `import(...)` types in JSDoc comments.



```id
js/** * @param {import("./some-module").SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



If you wanted to reuse the same type in multiple places, you could use a `typedef` to avoid repeating the import.



```id
js/** * @typedef {import("./some-module").SomeType} SomeType *//** * @param {SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



This helps with local uses of `SomeType`, but it gets repetitive for many imports and can be a bit verbose.

That’s why TypeScript now supports a new `@import` comment tag that has the same syntax as ECMAScript imports.



```id
js/** @import { SomeType } from "some-module" *//** * @param {SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



Here, we used named imports.
We could also have written our import as a namespace import.



```id
js/** @import * as someModule from "some-module" *//** * @param {someModule.SomeType} myValue */function doSomething(myValue) {    // ...}
```



Because these are just JSDoc comments, they don’t affect runtime behavior at all.

We would like to extend a big thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk who contributed this change !

## Regular Expression Syntax Checking

Until now, TypeScript has typically skipped over most regular expressions in code.
This is because regular expressions technically have an extensible grammar and TypeScript never made any effort to compile regular expressions to earlier versions of JavaScript.
Still, this meant that lots of common problems would go undiscovered in regular expressions, and they would either turn into errors at runtime, or silently fail.

But TypeScript now does basic syntax checking on regular expressions!



```id
tslet myRegex = /@robot(\s+(please|immediately)))? do some task/;//                                            ~// error!// Unexpected ')'. Did you mean to escape it with backslash?
```



This is a simple example, but this checking can catch a lot of common mistakes.
In fact, TypeScript’s checking goes slightly beyond syntactic checks.
For instance, TypeScript can now catch issues around backreferences that don’t exist.



```id
tslet myRegex = /@typedef \{import\((.+)\)\.([a-zA-Z_]+)\} \3/u;//                                                        ~// error!// This backreference refers to a group that does not exist.// There are only 2 capturing groups in this regular expression.
```



The same applies to named capturing groups.



```id
tslet myRegex = /@typedef \{import\((?<importPath>.+)\)\.(?<importedEntity>[a-zA-Z_]+)\} \k<namedImport>/;//                                                                                        ~~~~~~~~~~~// error!// There is no capturing group named 'namedImport' in this regular expression.
```



TypeScript’s checking is now also aware of when certain RegExp features are used when newer than your target version of ECMAScript.
For example, if we use named capturing groups like the above in an ES5 target, we’ll get an error.



```id
tslet myRegex = /@typedef \{import\((?<importPath>.+)\)\.(?<importedEntity>[a-zA-Z_]+)\} \k<importedEntity>/;//                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// error!// Named capturing groups are only available when targeting 'ES2018' or later.
```



The same is true for certain regular expression flags as well.

Note that TypeScript’s regular expression support is limited to regular expression literals .
If you try calling `new RegExp` with a string literal, TypeScript will not check the provided string.

We would like to thank GitHub user graphemecluster who iterated a ton with us to get this feature into TypeScript .

## Support for New ECMAScript `Set` Methods

TypeScript 5.5 declares new proposed methods for the ECMAScript `Set` type .

Some of these methods, like `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, and `symmetricDifference`, take another `Set` and return a new `Set` as the result.
The other methods, `isSubsetOf`, `isSupersetOf`, and `isDisjointFrom`, take another `Set` and return a `boolean`.
None of these methods mutate the original `Set`s.

Here’s a quick example of how you might use these methods and how they behave:



```id
tslet fruits = new Set(["apples", "bananas", "pears", "oranges"]);let applesAndBananas = new Set(["apples", "bananas"]);let applesAndOranges = new Set(["apples", "oranges"]);let oranges = new Set(["oranges"]);let emptySet = new Set();////// union////// Set(4) {'apples', 'bananas', 'pears', 'oranges'}console.log(fruits.union(oranges));// Set(3) {'apples', 'bananas', 'oranges'}console.log(applesAndBananas.union(oranges));////// intersection////// Set(2) {'apples', 'bananas'}console.log(fruits.intersection(applesAndBananas));// Set(0) {}console.log(applesAndBananas.intersection(oranges));// Set(1) {'apples'}console.log(applesAndBananas.intersection(applesAndOranges));////// difference////// Set(3) {'apples', 'bananas', 'pears'}console.log(fruits.difference(oranges));// Set(2) {'pears', 'oranges'}console.log(fruits.difference(applesAndBananas));// Set(1) {'bananas'}console.log(applesAndBananas.difference(applesAndOranges));////// symmetricDifference////// Set(2) {'bananas', 'oranges'}console.log(applesAndBananas.symmetricDifference(applesAndOranges)); // no apples////// isDisjointFrom////// trueconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isDisjointFrom(oranges));// falseconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isDisjointFrom(applesAndOranges));// trueconsole.log(fruits.isDisjointFrom(emptySet));// trueconsole.log(emptySet.isDisjointFrom(emptySet));////// isSubsetOf////// trueconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isSubsetOf(fruits));// falseconsole.log(fruits.isSubsetOf(applesAndBananas));// falseconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isSubsetOf(oranges));// trueconsole.log(fruits.isSubsetOf(fruits));// trueconsole.log(emptySet.isSubsetOf(fruits));////// isSupersetOf////// trueconsole.log(fruits.isSupersetOf(applesAndBananas));// falseconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isSupersetOf(fruits));// falseconsole.log(applesAndBananas.isSupersetOf(oranges));// trueconsole.log(fruits.isSupersetOf(fruits));// falseconsole.log(emptySet.isSupersetOf(fruits));
```



We’d like to thank Kevin Gibbons who not only co-championed the feature in ECMAScript, but also provided the declarations for `Set`, `ReadonlySet`, and `ReadonlySetLike` in TypeScript !

## Isolated Declarations

 This section was co-authored by Rob Palmer who supported the design of isolated declarations. 

Declaration files (a.k.a. `.d.ts` files) describe the shape of existing libraries and modules to TypeScript.
This lightweight description includes the library’s type signatures and excludes implementation details such as the function bodies.
They are published so that TypeScript can efficiently check your usage of a library without needing to analyse the library itself.
Whilst it is possible to handwrite declaration files, if you are authoring typed code, it’s much safer and simpler to let TypeScript generate them automatically from source files using `--declaration`.

The TypeScript compiler and its APIs have always had the job of generating declaration files;
however, there are some use-cases where you might want to use other tools, or where the traditional build process doesn’t scale.

### Use-case: Faster Declaration Emit Tools

Imagine if you wanted to create a faster tool to generate declaration files, perhaps as part of a publishing service or a new bundler.
Whilst there is a thriving ecosystem of blazing fast tools that can turn TypeScript into JavaScript, the same is not true for turning TypeScript into declaration files.
The reason is that TypeScript’s inference allows us to write code without explicitly declaring types, meaning declaration emit can be complex.

Let’s consider a simple example of a function that adds two imported variables.



```id
ts// util.tsexport let one = "1";export let two = "2";// add.tsimport { one, two } from "./util";export function add() { return one + two; }
```



Even if the only thing we want to do is generate `add.d.ts`, TypeScript needs to crawl into another imported file (`util.ts`), infer that the type of `one` and `two` are strings, and then calculate that the `+` operator on two strings will lead to a `string` return type.



```id
ts// add.d.tsexport declare function add(): string;
```



While this inference is important for the developer experience, it means that tools that want to generate declaration files would need to replicate parts of the type-checker including inference and the ability to resolve module specifiers to follow the imports.

### Use-case: Parallel Declaration Emit and Parallel Checking

Imagine if you had a monorepo containing many projects and a multi-core CPU that just wished it could help you check your code faster.
Wouldn’t it be great if we could check all those projects at the same time by running each project on a different core?

Unfortunately we don’t have the freedom to do all the work in parallel.
The reason is that we have to build those projects in dependency order, because each project is checking against the declaration files of their dependencies.
So we must build the dependency first to generate the declaration files.
TypeScript’s project references feature works the same way, building the set of projects in “topological” dependency order.

As an example, if we have two projects called `backend` and `frontend`, and they both depend on a project called `core`, TypeScript can’t start type-checking either `frontend` or `backend` until `core` has been built and its declaration files have been generated.

 

In the above graph, you can see that we have a bottleneck.
Whilst we can build `frontend` and `backend` in parallel, we need to first wait for `core` to finish building before either can start.

How could we improve upon this?
Well, if a fast tool could generate all those declaration files for `core` in parallel , TypeScript then could immediately follow that by type-checking `core`, `frontend`, and `backend` also in parallel .

### Solution: Explicit Types!

The common requirement in both use-cases is that we need a cross-file type-checker to generate declaration files.
Which is a lot to ask from the tooling community.

As a more complex example, if we want a declaration file for the following code…



```id
tsimport { add } from "./add";const x = add();export function foo() {    return x;}
```



…we would need to generate a signature for `foo`.
Well that requires looking at the implementation of `foo`.
`foo` just returns `x`, so getting the type of `x` requires looking at the implementation of `add`.
But that might require looking at the implementation of `add`’s dependencies, and so on.
What we’re seeing here is that generating declaration files requires a whole lot of logic to figure out the types of different places that might not even be local to the current file.

Still, for developers looking for fast iteration time and fully parallel builds, there is another way of thinking about this problem.
A declaration file only requires the types of the public API of a module - in other words, the types of the things that are exported.
If, controversially, developers are willing to explicitly write out the types of the things they export, tools could generate declaration files without needing to look at the implementation of the module - and without reimplementing a full type-checker.

This is where the new `--isolatedDeclarations` option comes in.
`--isolatedDeclarations` reports errors when a module can’t be reliably transformed without a type-checker.
More plainly, it makes TypeScript report errors if you have a file that isn’t sufficiently annotated on its exports.

That means in the above example, we would see an error like the following:



```id
tsexport function foo() {//              ~~~// error! Function must have an explicit// return type annotation with --isolatedDeclarations.    return x;}
```



### Why are errors desirable?

Because it means that TypeScript can

- Tell us up-front whether other tools will have issues with generating declaration files

- Provide a quick fix to help add these missing annotations.

This mode doesn’t require annotations everywhere though.
For locals, these can be ignored, since they don’t affect the public API.
For example, the following code would not produce an error:



```id
tsimport { add } from "./add";const x = add("1", "2"); // no error on 'x', it's not exported.export function foo(): string {    return x;}
```



There are also certain expressions where the type is “trivial” to calculate.



```id
ts// No error on 'x'.// It's trivial to calculate the type is 'number'export let x = 10;// No error on 'y'.// We can get the type from the return expression.export function y() {    return 20;}// No error on 'z'.// The type assertion makes it clear what the type is.export function z() {    return Math.max(x, y()) as number;}
```



### Using `isolatedDeclarations`

`isolatedDeclarations` requires that either the `declaration` or `composite` flags are also set.

Note that `isolatedDeclarations` does not change how TypeScript performs emit - just how it reports errors.
Importantly, and similar to `isolatedModules`, enabling the feature in TypeScript won’t immediately bring about the potential benefits discussed here.
So please be patient and look forward to future developments in this space.
Keeping tool authors in mind, we should also recognize that today, not all of TypeScript’s declaration emit can be easily replicated by other tools wanting to use it as a guide.
That’s something we’re actively working on improving.

On top of this, isolated declarations are still a new feature, and we’re actively working on improving the experience.
Some scenarios, like using computed property declarations in classes and object literals, are not yet supported under `isolatedDeclarations`.
Keep an eye on this space, and feel free to provide us with feedback.

We also feel it is worth calling out that `isolatedDeclarations` should be adopted on a case-by-case basis.
There are some developer ergonomics that are lost when using `isolatedDeclarations`, and thus it may not be the right choice if your setup is not leveraging the two scenarios mentioned earlier.
For others, the work on `isolatedDeclarations` has already uncovered many optimizations and opportunities to unlock different parallel build strategies.
In the meantime, if you’re willing to make the trade-offs, we believe `isolatedDeclarations` can be a powerful tool to speed up your build process as external tooling becomes more widely available.

For more information, read up on the Isolated Declarations: State of the Feature discussion on the TypeScript issue tracker.

### Credit

Work on `isolatedDeclarations` has been a long-time collaborative effort between the TypeScript team and the infrastructure and tooling teams within Bloomberg and Google.
Individuals like Hana Joo from Google who implemented the quick fix for isolated declaration errors (more on that soon), as well as Ashley Claymore, Jan Kühle, Lisa Velden, Rob Palmer, and Thomas Chetwin have been involved in discussion, specification, and implementation for many months.
But we feel it is specifically worth calling out the tremendous amount of work provided by Titian Cernicova-Dragomir from Bloomberg.
Titian has been instrumental in driving the implementation of `isolatedDeclarations` and has been a contributor to the TypeScript project for years prior.

While the feature involved many changes, you can see the core work for Isolated Declarations here .

## The `${configDir}` Template Variable for Configuration Files

It’s common in many codebases to reuse a shared `tsconfig.json` file that acts as a “base” for other configuration files.
This is done by using the `extends` field in a `tsconfig.json` file.



```id
json{    "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "./dist"    }}
```



One of the issues with this is that all paths in the `tsconfig.json` file are relative to the location of the file itself.
This means that if you have a shared `tsconfig.base.json` file that is used by multiple projects, relative paths often won’t be useful in the derived projects.
For example, imagine the following `tsconfig.base.json`:



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "typeRoots": [            "./node_modules/@types",            "./custom-types"        ],        "outDir": "dist"    }}
```



If author’s intent was that every `tsconfig.json` that extends this file should

- output to a `dist` directory relative to the derived `tsconfig.json` , and

- have a `custom-types` directory relative to the derived `tsconfig.json`,

then this would not work.
The `typeRoots` paths would be relative to the location of the shared `tsconfig.base.json` file, not the project that extends it.
Each project that extends this shared file would need to declare its own `outDir` and `typeRoots` with identical contents.
This could be frustrating and hard to keep in sync between projects, and while the example above is using `typeRoots`, this is a common problem for `paths` and other options.

To solve this, TypeScript 5.5 introduces a new template variable `${configDir}`.
When `${configDir}` is written in certain path fields of a `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` files, this variable is substituted with the containing directory of the configuration file in a given compilation.
This means that the above `tsconfig.base.json` could be rewritten as:



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "typeRoots": [            "${configDir}/node_modules/@types",            "${configDir}/custom-types"        ],        "outDir": "${configDir}/dist"    }}
```



Now, when a project extends this file, the paths will be relative to the derived `tsconfig.json`, not the shared `tsconfig.base.json` file.
This makes it easier to share configuration files across projects and ensures that the configuration files are more portable.

If you intend to make a `tsconfig.json` file extendable, consider if a `./` should instead be written with `${configDir}`.

For more information, see the proposal issue and the implementing pull request .

## Consulting `package.json` Dependencies for Declaration File Generation

Previously, TypeScript would often issue an error message like



```
The inferred type of "X" cannot be named without a reference to "Y". This is likely not portable. A type annotation is necessary.
```



This was often due to TypeScript’s declaration file generation finding itself in the contents of files that were never explicitly imported in a program.
Generating an import to such a file could be risky if the path ended up being relative.
Still, for codebases with explicit dependencies in the `dependencies` (or `peerDependencies` and `optionalDependencies`) of a `package.json`, generating such an import should be safe under certain resolution modes.
So in TypeScript 5.5, we’re more lenient when that’s the case, and many occurrences of this error should disappear.

 See this pull request for more details on the change.

## Editor and Watch-Mode Reliability Improvements

TypeScript has either added some new functionality or fixed existing logic that makes `--watch` mode and TypeScript’s editor integration feel more reliable.
That should hopefully translate to fewer TSServer/editor restarts.

### Correctly Refresh Editor Errors in Configuration Files

TypeScript can generate errors for `tsconfig.json` files;
however, those errors are actually generated from loading a project, and editors typically don’t directly request those errors for `tsconfig.json` files.
While this sounds like a technical detail, it means that when all errors issued in a `tsconfig.json` are fixed, TypeScript doesn’t issue a new fresh empty set of errors, and users are left with stale errors unless they reload their editor.

TypeScript 5.5 now intentionally issues an event to clear these out.
 See more here .

### Better Handling for Deletes Followed by Immediate Writes

Instead of overwriting files, some tools will opt to delete them and then create new files from scratch.
This is the case when running `npm ci`, for instance.

While this can be efficient for those tools, it can be problematic for TypeScript’s editor scenarios where deleting a watched might dispose of it and all of its transitive dependencies.
Deleting and creating a file in quick succession could lead to TypeScript tearing down an entire project and then rebuilding it from scratch.

TypeScript 5.5 now has a more nuanced approach by keeping parts of a deleted project around until it picks up on a new creation event.
This should make operations like `npm ci` work a lot better with TypeScript.
See more information on the approach here .

### Symlinks are Tracked in Failed Resolutions

When TypeScript fails to resolve a module, it will still need to watch for any failed lookup paths in case the module is added later.
Previously this was not done for symlinked directories, which could cause reliability issues in monorepo-like scenarios when a build occurred in one project but was not witnessed in the other.
This should be fixed in TypeScript 5.5, and means you won’t need to restart your editor as often.

 See more information here .

### Project References Contribute to Auto-Imports

Auto-imports no longer requires at least one explicit import to dependent projects in a project reference setup.
Instead, auto-import completions should just work across anything you’ve listed in the `references` field of your `tsconfig.json`.

 See more on the implementing pull request .

## Performance and Size Optimizations

### Monomorphized Objects in Language Service and Public API

In TypeScript 5.0, we ensured that our `Node` and `Symbol` objects had a consistent set of properties with a consistent initialization order.
Doing so helps reduce polymorphism in different operations, which allows runtimes to fetch properties more quickly.

By making this change, we witnessed impressive speed wins in the compiler;
however, most of these changes were performed on internal allocators for our data structures.
The language service, along with TypeScript’s public API, uses a different set of allocators for certain objects.
This allowed the TypeScript compiler to be a bit leaner, as data used only for the language service would never be used in the compiler.

In TypeScript 5.5, the same monomorphization work has been done for the language service and public API.
What this means is that your editor experience, and any build tools that use the TypeScript API, will get a decent amount faster.
In fact, in our benchmarks, we’ve seen a 5-8% speedup in build times when using the public TypeScript API’s allocators, and language service operations getting 10-20% faster .
While this does imply an increase in memory, we believe that tradeoff is worth it and hope to find ways to reduce that memory overhead.
Things should feel a lot snappier now.

For more information, see the change here .

### Monomorphized Control Flow Nodes

In TypeScript 5.5, nodes of the control flow graph have been monomorphized so that they always hold a consistent shape.
By doing so, check times will often be reduced by about 1%.

 See this change here .

### Optimizations on our Control Flow Graph

In many cases, control flow analysis will traverse nodes that don’t provide any new information.
We observed that in the absence of any early termination or effects in the antecedents (or “dominators”) of certain nodes meant that those nodes could always be skipped over.
As such, TypeScript now constructs its control flow graphs to take advantage of this by linking to an earlier node that does provide interesting information for control flow analysis.
This yields a flatter control flow graph, which can be more efficient to traverse.
This optimization has yielded modest gains, but with up to 2% reductions in build time on certain codebases.

You can read more here .

### Skipped Checking in `transpileModule` and `transpileDeclaration`

TypeScript’s `transpileModule` API can be used for compiling a single TypeScript file’s contents into JavaScript.
Similarly, the `transpileDeclaration` API (see below) can be used to generate a declaration file for a single TypeScript file.
One of the issues with these APIs is that TypeScript internally would perform a full type-checking pass over the entire contents of the file before emitting the output.
This was necessary to collect certain information which would later be used for the emit phase.

In TypeScript 5.5, we’ve found a way to avoid performing a full check, only lazily collecting this information as necessary, and `transpileModule` and `transpileDeclaration` both enable this functionality by default.
As a result, tools that integrate with these APIs, like ts-loader with `transpileOnly` and ts-jest , should see a noticeable speedup.
In our testing, we generally witness around a 2x speed-up in build time using `transpileModule` .

### TypeScript Package Size Reduction

Further leveraging our transition to modules in 5.0 , we’ve significantly reduced TypeScript’s overall package size by making `tsserver.js` and `typingsInstaller.js` import from a common API library instead of having each of them produce standalone bundles .

This reduces TypeScript’s size on disk from 30.2 MB to 20.4 MB, and reduces its packed size from 5.5 MB to 3.7 MB!

### Node Reuse in Declaration Emit

As part of the work to enable `isolatedDeclarations`, we’ve substantially improved how often TypeScript can directly copy your input source code when producing declaration files.

For example, let’s say you wrote



```id
tsexport const strBool: string | boolean = "hello";export const boolStr: boolean | string = "world";
```



Note that the union types are equivalent, but the order of the union is different.
When emitting the declaration file, TypeScript has two equivalent output possibilities.

The first is to use a consistent canonical representation for each type:



```id
tsexport const strBool: string | boolean;export const boolStr: string | boolean;
```



The second is to re-use the type annotations exactly as written:



```id
tsexport const strBool: string | boolean;export const boolStr: boolean | string;
```



The second approach is generally preferable for a few reasons:

- Many equivalent representations still encode some level of intent that is better to preserve in the declaration file

- Producing a fresh representation of a type can be somewhat expensive, so avoiding is better

- User-written types are usually shorter than generated type representations

In 5.5, we’ve greatly improved the number of places where TypeScript can correctly identify places where it’s safe and correct to print back types exactly as they were written in the input file.
Many of these cases are invisible performance improvements - TypeScript would generate fresh sets of syntax nodes and serialize them into a string.
Instead, TypeScript can now operate over the original syntax nodes directly, which is much cheaper and faster.

### Caching Contextual Types from Discriminated Unions

When TypeScript asks for the contextual type of an expression like an object literal, it will often encounter a union type.
In those cases, TypeScript tries to filter out members of the union based on known properties with well known values (i.e. discriminant properties).
This work can be fairly expensive, especially if you end up with an object consisting of many many properties.
In TypeScript 5.5, much of the computation is cached once so that TypeScript doesn’t need to recompute it for every property in the object literal .
Performing this optimization shaved 250ms off of compiling the TypeScript compiler itself.

## Easier API Consumption from ECMAScript Modules

Previously, if you were writing an ECMAScript module in Node.js, named imports were not available from the `typescript` package.



```id
tsimport { createSourceFile } from "typescript"; // ❌ errorimport * as ts from "typescript";ts.createSourceFile // ❌ undefined???ts.default.createSourceFile // ✅ works - but ugh!
```



This is because cjs-module-lexer did not recognize the pattern of TypeScript’s generated CommonJS code.
This has been fixed, and users can now use named imports from the TypeScript npm package with ECMAScript modules in Node.js.



```id
tsimport { createSourceFile } from "typescript"; // ✅ works now!import * as ts from "typescript";ts.createSourceFile // ✅ works now!
```



For more information, see the change here .

## The `transpileDeclaration` API

TypeScript’s API exposes a function called `transpileModule`.
It’s intended to make it easy to compile a single file of TypeScript code.
Because it doesn’t have access to an entire program , the caveat is that it may not produce the right output if the code violates any errors under the `isolatedModules` option.

In TypeScript 5.5, we’ve added a new similar API called `transpileDeclaration`.
This API is similar to `transpileModule`, but it’s specifically designed to generate a single declaration file based on some input source text.
Just like `transpileModule`, it doesn’t have access to a full program, and a similar caveat applies: it only generates an accurate declaration file if the input code is free of errors under the new `isolatedDeclarations` option.

If desired, this function can be used to parallelize declaration emit across all files under `isolatedDeclarations` mode.

For more information, see the implementation here .

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### Disabling Features Deprecated in TypeScript 5.0

TypeScript 5.0 deprecated the following options and behaviors:

- `charset`

- `target: ES3`

- `importsNotUsedAsValues`

- `noImplicitUseStrict`

- `noStrictGenericChecks`

- `keyofStringsOnly`

- `suppressExcessPropertyErrors`

- `suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors`

- `out`

- `preserveValueImports`

- `prepend` in project references

- implicitly OS-specific `newLine`

To continue using the deprecated options above, developers using TypeScript 5.0 and other more recent versions have had to specify a new option called `ignoreDeprecations` with the value `"5.0"`.

In TypeScript 5.5, these options no longer have any effect.
To help with a smooth upgrade path, you may still specify them in your tsconfig, but these will be an error to specify in TypeScript 6.0.
See also the Flag Deprecation Plan which outlines our deprecation strategy.

 More information around these deprecation plans is available on GitHub , which contains suggestions in how to best adapt your codebase.

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see the DOM updates for TypeScript 5.5 .

### Stricter Parsing for Decorators

Since TypeScript originally introduced support for decorators, the specified grammar for the proposal has been tightened up.
TypeScript is now stricter about what forms it allows.
While rare, existing decorators may need to be parenthesized to avoid errors.



```id
tsclass DecoratorProvider {    decorate(...args: any[]) { }}class D extends DecoratorProvider {    m() {        class C {            @super.decorate // ❌ error            method1() { }            @(super.decorate) // ✅ okay            method2() { }        }    }}
```



See more information on the change here .

### `undefined` is No Longer a Definable Type Name

TypeScript has always disallowed type alias names that conflict with built-in types:



```id
ts// Illegaltype null = any;// Illegaltype number = any;// Illegaltype object = any;// Illegaltype any = any;
```



Due to a bug, this logic didn’t also apply to the built-in type `undefined`.
In 5.5, this is now correctly identified as an error:



```id
ts// Now also illegaltype undefined = any;
```



Bare references to type aliases named `undefined` never actually worked in the first place.
You could define them, but you couldn’t use them as an unqualified type name.



```id
tsexport type undefined = string;export const m: undefined = "";//           ^// Errors in 5.4 and earlier - the local definition of 'undefined' was not even consulted.
```



For more information, see the change here .

### Simplified Reference Directive Declaration Emit

When producing a declaration file, TypeScript would synthesize a reference directive when it believed one was required.
For example, all Node.js modules are declared ambiently, so cannot be loaded by module resolution alone.
A file like:



```id
tsximport path from "path";export const myPath = path.parse(__filename);
```



Would emit a declaration file like:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="node" />import path from "path";export declare const myPath: path.ParsedPath;
```



Even though the reference directive never appeared in the original source.

Similarly, TypeScript also removed reference directives that it did not believe needed to be a part of the output.
For example, let’s imagine we had a reference directive to `jest`;
however, imagine the reference directive isn’t necessary to generate the declaration file.
TypeScript would simply drop it.
So in the following example:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="jest" />import path from "path";export const myPath = path.parse(__filename);
```



TypeScript would still emit:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="node" />import path from "path";export declare const myPath: path.ParsedPath;
```



In the course of working on `isolatedDeclarations`, we realized that this logic was untenable for anyone attempting to implement a declaration emitter without type checking or using more than a single file’s context.
This behavior is also hard to understand from a user’s perspective; whether or not a reference directive appeared in the emitted file seems inconsistent and difficult to predict unless you understand exactly what’s going on during typechecking.
To prevent declaration emit from being different when `isolatedDeclarations` was enabled, we knew that our emit needed to change.

Through experimentation , we found that nearly all cases where TypeScript synthesized reference directives were just to pull in `node` or `react`.
These are cases where the expectation is that a downstream user already references those types through tsconfig.json `"types"` or library imports, so no longer synthesizing these reference directives would be unlikely to break anyone.
It’s worth noting that this is already how it works for `lib.d.ts`; TypeScript doesn’t synthesize a reference to `lib="es2015"` when a module exports a `WeakMap`, instead assuming that a downstream user will have included that as part of their environment.

For reference directives that had been written by library authors (not synthesized), further experimentation showed that nearly all were removed, never showing up in the output.
Most reference directives that were preserved were broken and likely not intended to be preserved.

Given those results, we decided to greatly simplfy reference directives in declaration emit in TypeScript 5.5.
A more consistent strategy will help library authors and consumers have better control of their declaration files.

Reference directives are no longer synthesized.
User-written reference directives are no longer preserved, unless annotated with a new `preserve="true"` attribute.
Concretely, an input file like:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="some-lib" preserve="true" />/// <reference types="jest" />import path from "path";export const myPath = path.parse(__filename);
```



will emit:



```id
tsx/// <reference types="some-lib" preserve="true" />import path from "path";export declare const myPath: path.ParsedPath;
```



Adding `preserve="true"` is backwards compatible with older versions of TypeScript as unknown attributes are ignored.

This change also improved performance; in our benchmarks, the emit stage saw a 1-4% improvement in projects with declaration emit enabled.

# TypeScript 4.7

 

## ECMAScript Module Support in Node.js

For the last few years, Node.js has been working to support ECMAScript modules (ESM).
This has been a very difficult feature, since the Node.js ecosystem is built on a different module system called CommonJS (CJS).
Interoperating between the two brings large challenges, with many new features to juggle;
however, support for ESM in Node.js was largely implemented in Node.js 12 and later.
Around TypeScript 4.5 we rolled out nightly-only support for ESM in Node.js to get some feedback from users and let library authors ready themselves for broader support.

TypeScript 4.7 adds this functionality with two new `module` settings: `node16` and `nodenext`.



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "module": "node16",    }}
```



These new modes bring a few high-level features which we’ll explore here.

### `type` in `package.json` and New Extensions

Node.js supports a new setting in `package.json` called `type`.
`"type"` can be set to either `"module"` or `"commonjs"`.



```id
jsonc{    "name": "my-package",    "type": "module",    "//": "...",    "dependencies": {    }}
```



This setting controls whether `.js` and `.d.ts` files are interpreted as ES modules or CommonJS modules, and defaults to CommonJS when not set.
When a file is considered an ES module, a few different rules come into play compared to CommonJS:

 `import`/`export` statements can be used.

- Top-level `await` can be used

- Relative import paths need full extensions (we have to write `import "./foo.js"` instead of `import "./foo"`).

- Imports might resolve differently from dependencies in `node_modules`.

- Certain global-like values like `require` and `module` cannot be used directly.

- CommonJS modules get imported under certain special rules.

We’ll come back to some of these.

To overlay the way TypeScript works in this system, `.ts` and `.tsx` files now work the same way.
When TypeScript finds a `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, or `.jsx` file, it will walk up looking for a `package.json` to see whether that file is an ES module, and use that to determine:

- how to find other modules which that file imports

- and how to transform that file if producing outputs

When a `.ts` file is compiled as an ES module, ECMAScript `import`/`export` statements are left alone in the `.js` output;
when it’s compiled as a CommonJS module, it will produce the same output you get today under `--module commonjs`.

This also means paths resolve differently between `.ts` files that are ES modules and ones that are CJS modules.
For example, let’s say you have the following code today:



```id
ts// ./foo.tsexport function helper() {    // ...}// ./bar.tsimport { helper } from "./foo"; // only works in CJShelper();
```



This code works in CommonJS modules, but will fail in ES modules because relative import paths need to use extensions.
As a result, it will have to be rewritten to use the extension of the output of `foo.ts` - so `bar.ts` will instead have to import from `./foo.js`.



```id
ts// ./bar.tsimport { helper } from "./foo.js"; // works in ESM & CJShelper();
```



This might feel a bit cumbersome at first, but TypeScript tooling like auto-imports and path completion will typically just do this for you.

One other thing to mention is the fact that this applies to `.d.ts` files too.
When TypeScript finds a `.d.ts` file in a package, it is interpreted based on the containing package.

### New File Extensions

The `type` field in `package.json` is nice because it allows us to continue using the `.ts` and `.js` file extensions which can be convenient;
however, you will occasionally need to write a file that differs from what `type` specifies.
You might also just prefer to always be explicit.

Node.js supports two extensions to help with this: `.mjs` and `.cjs`.
`.mjs` files are always ES modules, and `.cjs` files are always CommonJS modules, and there’s no way to override these.

In turn, TypeScript supports two new source file extensions: `.mts` and `.cts`.
When TypeScript emits these to JavaScript files, it will emit them to `.mjs` and `.cjs` respectively.

Furthermore, TypeScript also supports two new declaration file extensions: `.d.mts` and `.d.cts`.
When TypeScript generates declaration files for `.mts` and `.cts`, their corresponding extensions will be `.d.mts` and `.d.cts`.

Using these extensions is entirely optional, but will often be useful even if you choose not to use them as part of your primary workflow.

### CommonJS Interoperability

Node.js allows ES modules to import CommonJS modules as if they were ES modules with a default export.



```id
ts// ./foo.ctsexport function helper() {    console.log("hello world!");}// ./bar.mtsimport foo from "./foo.cjs";// prints "hello world!"foo.helper();
```



In some cases, Node.js also synthesizes named exports from CommonJS modules, which can be more convenient.
In these cases, ES modules can use a “namespace-style” import (i.e. `import * as foo from "..."`), or named imports (i.e. `import { helper } from "..."`).



```id
ts// ./foo.ctsexport function helper() {    console.log("hello world!");}// ./bar.mtsimport { helper } from "./foo.cjs";// prints "hello world!"helper();
```



There isn’t always a way for TypeScript to know whether these named imports will be synthesized, but TypeScript will err on being permissive and use some heuristics when importing from a file that is definitely a CommonJS module.

One TypeScript-specific note about interop is the following syntax:



```id
tsimport foo = require("foo");
```



In a CommonJS module, this just boils down to a `require()` call, and in an ES module, this imports `createRequire` to achieve the same thing.
This will make code less portable on runtimes like the browser (which don’t support `require()`), but will often be useful for interoperability.
In turn, you can write the above example using this syntax as follows:



```id
ts// ./foo.ctsexport function helper() {    console.log("hello world!");}// ./bar.mtsimport foo = require("./foo.cjs");foo.helper()
```



Finally, it’s worth noting that the only way to import ESM files from a CJS module is using dynamic `import()` calls.
This can present challenges, but is the behavior in Node.js today.

You can read more about ESM/CommonJS interop in Node.js here .

### `package.json` Exports, Imports, and Self-Referencing

Node.js supports a new field for defining entry points in `package.json` called `"exports"` .
This field is a more powerful alternative to defining `"main"` in `package.json`, and can control what parts of your package are exposed to consumers.

Here’s a `package.json` that supports separate entry-points for CommonJS and ESM:



```id
jsonc// package.json{    "name": "my-package",    "type": "module",    "exports": {        ".": {            // Entry-point for `import "my-package"` in ESM            "import": "./esm/index.js",            // Entry-point for `require("my-package") in CJS            "require": "./commonjs/index.cjs",        },    },    // CJS fall-back for older versions of Node.js    "main": "./commonjs/index.cjs",}
```



There’s a lot to this feature, which you can read more about on the Node.js documentation .
Here we’ll try to focus on how TypeScript supports it.

With TypeScript’s original Node support, it would look for a `"main"` field, and then look for declaration files that corresponded to that entry.
For example, if `"main"` pointed to `./lib/index.js`, TypeScript would look for a file called `./lib/index.d.ts`.
A package author could override this by specifying a separate field called `"types"` (e.g. `"types": "./types/index.d.ts"`).

The new support works similarly with import conditions .
By default, TypeScript overlays the same rules with import conditions - if you write an `import` from an ES module, it will look up the `import` field, and from a CommonJS module, it will look at the `require` field.
If it finds them, it will look for a corresponding declaration file.
If you need to point to a different location for your type declarations, you can add a `"types"` import condition.



```id
jsonc// package.json{    "name": "my-package",    "type": "module",    "exports": {        ".": {            // Entry-point for `import "my-package"` in ESM            "import": {                // Where TypeScript will look.                "types": "./types/esm/index.d.ts",                // Where Node.js will look.                "default": "./esm/index.js"            },            // Entry-point for `require("my-package") in CJS            "require": {                // Where TypeScript will look.                "types": "./types/commonjs/index.d.cts",                // Where Node.js will look.                "default": "./commonjs/index.cjs"            },        }    },    // Fall-back for older versions of TypeScript    "types": "./types/index.d.ts",    // CJS fall-back for older versions of Node.js    "main": "./commonjs/index.cjs"}
```


 

The `"types"` condition should always come first in `"exports"`.

 

It’s important to note that the CommonJS entrypoint and the ES module entrypoint each needs its own declaration file, even if the contents are the same between them.
Every declaration file is interpreted either as a CommonJS module or as an ES module, based on its file extension and the `"type"` field of the `package.json`, and this detected module kind must match the module kind that Node will detect for the corresponding JavaScript file for type checking to be correct.
Attempting to use a single `.d.ts` file to type both an ES module entrypoint and a CommonJS entrypoint will cause TypeScript to think only one of those entrypoints exists, causing compiler errors for users of the package.

TypeScript also supports the `"imports"` field of `package.json` in a similar manner by looking for declaration files alongside corresponding files, and supports packages self-referencing themselves .
These features are generally not as involved to set up, but are supported.

### Your Feedback Wanted!

As we continue working on TypeScript 4.7, we expect to see more documentation and polish go into this functionality.
Supporting these new features has been an ambitious under-taking, and that’s why we’re looking for early feedback on it!
Please try it out and let us know how it works for you.

For more information, you can see the implementing PR here .

## Control over Module Detection

One issue with the introduction of modules to JavaScript was the ambiguity between existing “script” code and the new module code.
JavaScript code in a module runs slightly differently, and has different scoping rules, so tools have to make decisions as to how each file runs.
For example, Node.js requires module entry-points to be written in a `.mjs`, or have a nearby `package.json` with `"type": "module"`.
TypeScript treats a file as a module whenever it finds any `import` or `export` statement in a file, but otherwise, will assume a `.ts` or `.js` file is a script file acting on the global scope.

This doesn’t quite match up with the behavior of Node.js where the `package.json` can change the format of a file, or the `--jsx` setting `react-jsx`, where any JSX file contains an implicit import to a JSX factory.
It also doesn’t match modern expectations where most new TypeScript code is written with modules in mind.

That’s why TypeScript 4.7 introduces a new option called `moduleDetection`.
`moduleDetection` can take on 3 values: `"auto"` (the default), `"legacy"` (the same behavior as 4.6 and prior), and `"force"`.

Under the mode `"auto"`, TypeScript will not only look for `import` and `export` statements, but it will also check whether

- the `"type"` field in `package.json` is set to `"module"` when running under `--module nodenext`/`--module node16`, and

- check whether the current file is a JSX file when running under `--jsx react-jsx`

In cases where you want every file to be treated as a module, the `"force"` setting ensures that every non-declaration file is treated as a module.
This will be true regardless of how `module`, `moduleResolution`, and `jsx` are configured.

Meanwhile, the `"legacy"` option simply goes back to the old behavior of only seeking out `import` and `export` statements to determine whether a file is a module.

You can read up more about this change on the pull request .

## Control-Flow Analysis for Bracketed Element Access

TypeScript 4.7 now narrows the types of element accesses when the indexed keys are literal types and unique symbols.
For example, take the following code:



```id
tsconst key = Symbol();const numberOrString = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 42 : "hello";const obj = {    [key]: numberOrString,};if (typeof obj[key] === "string") {    let str = obj[key].toUpperCase();}
```



Previously, TypeScript would not consider any type guards on `obj[key]`, and would have no idea that `obj[key]` was really a `string`.
Instead, it would think that `obj[key]` was still a `string | number` and accessing `toUpperCase()` would trigger an error.

TypeScript 4.7 now knows that `obj[key]` is a string.

This also means that under `--strictPropertyInitialization`, TypeScript can correctly check that computed properties are initialized by the end of a constructor body.



```id
ts// 'key' has type 'unique symbol'const key = Symbol();class C {    [key]: string;    constructor(str: string) {        // oops, forgot to set 'this[key]'    }    screamString() {        return this[key].toUpperCase();    }}
```



Under TypeScript 4.7, `--strictPropertyInitialization` reports an error telling us that the `[key]` property wasn’t definitely assigned by the end of the constructor.

We’d like to extend our gratitude to Oleksandr Tarasiuk who provided this change !

## Improved Function Inference in Objects and Methods

TypeScript 4.7 can now perform more granular inferences from functions within objects and arrays.
This allows the types of these functions to consistently flow in a left-to-right manner just like for plain arguments.



```id
tsdeclare function f<T>(arg: {    produce: (n: string) => T,    consume: (x: T) => void }): void;// Worksf({    produce: () => "hello",    consume: x => x.toLowerCase()});// Worksf({    produce: (n: string) => n,    consume: x => x.toLowerCase(),});// Was an error, now works.f({    produce: n => n,    consume: x => x.toLowerCase(),});// Was an error, now works.f({    produce: function () { return "hello"; },    consume: x => x.toLowerCase(),});// Was an error, now works.f({    produce() { return "hello" },    consume: x => x.toLowerCase(),});
```



Inference failed in some of these examples because knowing the type of their `produce` functions would indirectly request the type of `arg` before finding a good type for `T`.
TypeScript now gathers functions that could contribute to the inferred type of `T` and infers from them lazily.

For more information, you can take a look at the specific modifications to our inference process .

## Instantiation Expressions

Occasionally functions can be a bit more general than we want.
For example, let’s say we had a `makeBox` function.



```id
tsinterface Box<T> {    value: T;}function makeBox<T>(value: T) {    return { value };}
```



Maybe we want to create a more specialized set of functions for making `Box`es of `Wrench`es and `Hammer`s.
To do that today, we’d have to wrap `makeBox` in other functions, or use an explicit type for an alias of `makeBox`.



```id
tsfunction makeHammerBox(hammer: Hammer) {    return makeBox(hammer);}// or...const makeWrenchBox: (wrench: Wrench) => Box<Wrench> = makeBox;
```



These work, but wrapping a call to `makeBox` is a bit wasteful, and writing the full signature of `makeWrenchBox` could get unwieldy.
Ideally, we would be able to say that we just want to alias `makeBox` while replacing all of the generics in its signature.

TypeScript 4.7 allows exactly that!
We can now take functions and constructors and feed them type arguments directly.



```id
tsconst makeHammerBox = makeBox<Hammer>;const makeWrenchBox = makeBox<Wrench>;
```



So with this, we can specialize `makeBox` to accept more specific types and reject anything else.



```id
tsconst makeStringBox = makeBox<string>;// TypeScript correctly rejects this.makeStringBox(42);
```



This logic also works for constructor functions such as `Array`, `Map`, and `Set`.



```id
ts// Has type `new () => Map<string, Error>`const ErrorMap = Map<string, Error>;// Has type `// Map<string, Error>`const errorMap = new ErrorMap();
```



When a function or constructor is given type arguments, it will produce a new type that keeps all signatures with compatible type parameter lists, and replaces the corresponding type parameters with the given type arguments.
Any other signatures are dropped, as TypeScript will assume that they aren’t meant to be used.

For more information on this feature, check out the pull request .

## `extends` Constraints on `infer` Type Variables

Conditional types are a bit of a power-user feature.
They allow us to match and infer against the shape of types, and make decisions based on them.
For example, we can write a conditional type that returns the first element of a tuple type if it’s a `string`-like type.



```id
tstype FirstIfString<T> =    T extends [infer S, ...unknown[]]        ? S extends string ? S : never        : never; // stringtype A = FirstIfString<[string, number, number]>;// "hello"type B = FirstIfString<["hello", number, number]>;// "hello" | "world"type C = FirstIfString<["hello" | "world", boolean]>;// nevertype D = FirstIfString<[boolean, number, string]>;
```



`FirstIfString` matches against any tuple with at least one element and grabs the type of the first element as `S`.
Then it checks if `S` is compatible with `string` and returns that type if it is.

Note that we had to use two conditional types to write this.
We could have written `FirstIfString` as follows:



```id
tstype FirstIfString<T> =    T extends [string, ...unknown[]]        // Grab the first type out of `T`        ? T[0]        : never;
```



This works, but it’s slightly more “manual” and less declarative.
Instead of just pattern-matching on the type and giving the first element a name, we have to fetch out the `0`th element of `T` with `T[0]`.
If we were dealing with types more complex than tuples, this could get a lot trickier, so `infer` can simplify things.

Using nested conditionals to infer a type and then match against that inferred type is pretty common.
To avoid that second level of nesting, TypeScript 4.7 now allows you to place a constraint on any `infer` type.



```id
tstype FirstIfString<T> =    T extends [infer S extends string, ...unknown[]]        ? S        : never;
```



This way, when TypeScript matches against `S`, it also ensures that `S` has to be a `string`.
If `S` isn’t a `string`, it takes the false path, which in these cases is `never`.

For more details, you can read up on the change on GitHub .

## Optional Variance Annotations for Type Parameters

Let’s take the following types.



```id
tsinterface Animal {    animalStuff: any;}interface Dog extends Animal {    dogStuff: any;}// ...type Getter<T> = () => T;type Setter<T> = (value: T) => void;
```



Imagine we had two different instances of `Getter`s.
Figuring out whether any two different `Getter`s are substitutable for one another depends entirely on `T`.
In the case of whether an assignment of `Getter ` → `Getter ` is valid, we have to check whether `Dog` → `Animal` is valid.
Because each type for `T` just gets related in the same “direction”, we say that the `Getter` type is covariant on `T`.
On the other hand, checking whether `Setter ` → `Setter ` is valid involves checking whether `Animal` → `Dog` is valid.
That “flip” in direction is kind of like how in math, checking whether − x  <  −y is the same as checking whether y  <  x .
When we have to flip directions like this to compare `T`, we say that `Setter` is contravariant on `T`.

With TypeScript 4.7, we’re now able to explicitly specify variance on type parameters.

So now, if we want to make it explicit that `Getter` is covariant on `T`, we can now give it an `out` modifier.



```id
tstype Getter<out T> = () => T;
```



And similarly, if we also want to make it explicit that `Setter` is contravariant on `T`, we can give it an `in` modifier.



```id
tstype Setter<in T> = (value: T) => void;
```



`out` and `in` are used here because a type parameter’s variance depends on whether it’s used in an output or an input .
Instead of thinking about variance, you can just think about if `T` is used in output and input positions.

There are also cases for using both `in` and `out`.



```id
tsinterface State<in out T> {    get: () => T;    set: (value: T) => void;}
```



When a `T` is used in both an output and input position, it becomes invariant .
Two different `State `s can’t be interchanged unless their `T`s are the same.
In other words, `State ` and `State ` aren’t substitutable for the other.

Now technically speaking, in a purely structural type system, type parameters and their variance don’t really matter - you can just plug in types in place of each type parameter and check whether each matching member is structurally compatible.
So if TypeScript uses a structural type system, why are we interested in the variance of type parameters?
And why might we ever want to annotate them?

One reason is that it can be useful for a reader to explicitly see how a type parameter is used at a glance.
For much more complex types, it can be difficult to tell whether a type is meant to be read, written, or both.
TypeScript will also help us out if we forget to mention how that type parameter is used.
As an example, if we forgot to specify both `in` and `out` on `State`, we’d get an error.



```id
tsinterface State<out T> {    //          ~~~~~    // error!    // Type 'State<sub-T>' is not assignable to type 'State<super-T>' as implied by variance annotation.    //   Types of property 'set' are incompatible.    //     Type '(value: sub-T) => void' is not assignable to type '(value: super-T) => void'.    //       Types of parameters 'value' and 'value' are incompatible.    //         Type 'super-T' is not assignable to type 'sub-T'.    get: () => T;    set: (value: T) => void;}
```



Another reason is precision and speed!
TypeScript already tries to infer the variance of type parameters as an optimization.
By doing this, it can type-check larger structural types in a reasonable amount of time.
Calculating variance ahead of time allows the type-checker to skip deeper comparisons and just compare type arguments which can be much faster than comparing the full structure of a type over and over again.
But often there are cases where this calculation is still fairly expensive, and the calculation may find circularities that can’t be accurately resolved, meaning there’s no clear answer for the variance of a type.



```id
tstype Foo<T> = {    x: T;    f: Bar<T>;}type Bar<U> = (x: Baz<U[]>) => void;type Baz<V> = {    value: Foo<V[]>;}declare let foo1: Foo<unknown>;declare let foo2: Foo<string>;foo1 = foo2;  // Should be an error but isn't ❌foo2 = foo1;  // Error - correct ✅
```



Providing an explicit annotation can speed up type-checking at these circularities and provide better accuracy.
For instance, marking `T` as invariant in the above example can help stop the problematic assignment.



```id
diff- type Foo<T> = {+ type Foo<in out T> = {      x: T;      f: Bar<T>;  }
```



We don’t necessarily recommend annotating every type parameter with its variance;
For example, it’s possible (but not recommended) to make variance a little stricter than is necessary, so TypeScript won’t stop you from marking something as invariant if it’s really just covariant, contravariant, or even independent.
So if you do choose to add explicit variance markers, we would encourage thoughtful and precise use of them.

But if you’re working with deeply recursive types, especially if you’re a library author, you may be interested in using these annotations to the benefit of your users.
Those annotations can provide wins in both accuracy and type-checking speed, which can even affect their code editing experience.
Determining when variance calculation is a bottleneck on type-checking time can be done experimentally, and determined using tooling like our analyze-trace utility.

For more details on this feature, you can read up on the pull request .

## Resolution Customization with `moduleSuffixes`

TypeScript 4.7 now supports a `moduleSuffixes` option to customize how module specifiers are looked up.



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "moduleSuffixes": [".ios", ".native", ""]    }}
```



Given the above configuration, an import like the following…



```id
tsimport * as foo from "./foo";
```



will try to look at the relative files `./foo.ios.ts`, `./foo.native.ts`, and finally `./foo.ts`.

This feature can be useful for React Native projects where each target platform can use a separate `tsconfig.json` with differing `moduleSuffixes`.

 The `moduleSuffixes` option was contributed thanks to Adam Foxman !

## resolution-mode

With Node’s ECMAScript resolution, the mode of the containing file and the syntax you use determines how imports are resolved;
however it would be useful to reference the types of a CommonJS module from an ECMAScript module, or vice-versa.

TypeScript now allows `/// ` directives.



```id
ts/// <reference types="pkg" resolution-mode="require" />// or/// <reference types="pkg" resolution-mode="import" />
```



Additionally, in nightly versions of TypeScript, `import type` can specify an import assertion to achieve something similar.



```id
ts// Resolve `pkg` as if we were importing with a `require()`import type { TypeFromRequire } from "pkg" assert {    "resolution-mode": "require"};// Resolve `pkg` as if we were importing with an `import`import type { TypeFromImport } from "pkg" assert {    "resolution-mode": "import"};export interface MergedType extends TypeFromRequire, TypeFromImport {}
```



These import assertions can also be used on `import()` types.



```id
tsexport type TypeFromRequire =    import("pkg", { assert: { "resolution-mode": "require" } }).TypeFromRequire;export type TypeFromImport =    import("pkg", { assert: { "resolution-mode": "import" } }).TypeFromImport;export interface MergedType extends TypeFromRequire, TypeFromImport {}
```



The `import type` and `import()` syntaxes only support `resolution-mode` in nightly builds of TypeScript .
You’ll likely get an error like



```
Resolution mode assertions are unstable. Use nightly TypeScript to silence this error. Try updating with 'npm install -D typescript@next'.
```



If you do find yourself using this feature in nightly versions of TypeScript, consider providing feedback on this issue .

You can see the respective changes for reference directives and for type import assertions .

## Go to Source Definition

TypeScript 4.7 contains support for a new experimental editor command called Go To Source Definition .
It’s similar to Go To Definition , but it never returns results inside declaration files.
Instead, it tries to find corresponding implementation files (like `.js` or `.ts` files), and find definitions there — even if those files are normally shadowed by `.d.ts` files.

This comes in handy most often when you need to peek at the implementation of a function you’re importing from a library instead of its type declaration in a `.d.ts` file.

 

You can try this new command in the latest versions of Visual Studio Code.
Note, though, that this functionality is still in preview, and there are some known limitations.
In some cases TypeScript uses heuristics to guess which `.js` file corresponds to the given result of a definition, so these results might be inaccurate.
Visual Studio Code also doesn’t yet indicate whether a result was a guess, but it’s something we’re collaborating on.

You can leave feedback about the feature, read about known limitations, or learn more at our dedicated feedback issue .

## Group-Aware Organize Imports

TypeScript has an Organize Imports editor feature for both JavaScript and TypeScript.
Unfortunately, it could be a bit of a blunt instrument, and would often naively sort your import statements.

For instance, if you ran Organize Imports on the following file…



```id
ts// local codeimport * as bbb from "./bbb";import * as ccc from "./ccc";import * as aaa from "./aaa";// built-insimport * as path from "path";import * as child_process from "child_process"import * as fs from "fs";// some code...
```



You would get something like the following



```id
ts// local codeimport * as child_process from "child_process";import * as fs from "fs";// built-insimport * as path from "path";import * as aaa from "./aaa";import * as bbb from "./bbb";import * as ccc from "./ccc";// some code...
```



This is… not ideal.
Sure, our imports are sorted by their paths, and our comments and newlines are preserved, but not in a way we expected.
Much of the time, if we have our imports grouped in a specific way, then we want to keep them that way.

TypeScript 4.7 performs Organize Imports in a group-aware manner.
Running it on the above code looks a little bit more like what you’d expect:



```id
ts// local codeimport * as aaa from "./aaa";import * as bbb from "./bbb";import * as ccc from "./ccc";// built-insimport * as child_process from "child_process";import * as fs from "fs";import * as path from "path";// some code...
```



We’d like to extend our thanks to Minh Quy who provided this feature .

## Object Method Snippet Completions

TypeScript now provides snippet completions for object literal methods.
When completing members in an object, TypeScript will provide a typical completion entry for just the name of a method, along with a separate completion entry for the full method definition!

 

For more details, see the implementing pull request .

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Updates

While TypeScript strives to avoid major breaks, even small changes in the built-in libraries can cause issues.
We don’t expect major breaks as a result of DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates, but there may be some small ones.

### Stricter Spread Checks in JSX

When writing a `...spread` in JSX, TypeScript now enforces stricter checks that the given type is actually an object.
As a result, values with the types `unknown` and `never` (and more rarely, just bare `null` and `undefined`) can no longer be spread into JSX elements.

So for the following example:



```id
tsximport * as React from "react";interface Props {    stuff?: string;}function MyComponent(props: unknown) {    return <div {...props} />;}
```



you’ll now receive an error like the following:



```
Spread types may only be created from object types.
```



This makes this behavior more consistent with spreads in object literals.

For more details, see the change on GitHub .

### Stricter Checks with Template String Expressions

When a `symbol` value is used in a template string, it will trigger a runtime error in JavaScript.



```id
jslet str = `hello ${Symbol()}`;// TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string
```



As a result, TypeScript will issue an error as well;
however, TypeScript now also checks if a generic value that is constrained to a symbol in some way is used in a template string.



```id
tsfunction logKey<S extends string | symbol>(key: S): S {    // Now an error.    console.log(`${key} is the key`);    return key;}function get<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {    // Now an error.    console.log(`Grabbing property '${key}'.`);    return obj[key];}
```



TypeScript will now issue the following error:



```
Implicit conversion of a 'symbol' to a 'string' will fail at runtime. Consider wrapping this expression in 'String(...)'.
```



In some cases, you can get around this by wrapping the expression in a call to `String`, just like the error message suggests.



```id
tsfunction logKey<S extends string | symbol>(key: S): S {    // No longer an error.    console.log(`${String(key)} is the key`);    return key;}
```



In others, this error is too pedantic, and you might not ever care to even allow `symbol` keys when using `keyof`.
In such cases, you can switch to `string & keyof ...`:



```id
tsfunction get<T, K extends string & keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {    // No longer an error.    console.log(`Grabbing property '${key}'.`);    return obj[key];}
```



For more information, you can see the implementing pull request .

### `readFile` Method is No Longer Optional on `LanguageServiceHost`

If you’re creating `LanguageService` instances, then provided `LanguageServiceHost`s will need to provide a `readFile` method.
This change was necessary to support the new `moduleDetection` compiler option.

You can read more on the change here .

### `readonly` Tuples Have a `readonly` `length` Property

A `readonly` tuple will now treat its `length` property as `readonly`.
This was almost never witnessable for fixed-length tuples, but was an oversight which could be observed for tuples with trailing optional and rest element types.

As a result, the following code will now fail:



```id
tsfunction overwriteLength(tuple: readonly [string, string, string]) {    // Now errors.    tuple.length = 7;}
```

# TypeScript 5.4

 

## Preserved Narrowing in Closures Following Last Assignments

TypeScript can usually figure out a more specific type for a variable based on checks that you might perform.
This process is called narrowing.



```id
tsfunction uppercaseStrings(x: string | number) {    if (typeof x === "string") {        // TypeScript knows 'x' is a 'string' here.        return x.toUpperCase();    }}
```



One common pain point was that these narrowed types weren’t always preserved within function closures.



```id
tsfunction getUrls(url: string | URL, names: string[]) {    if (typeof url === "string") {        url = new URL(url);    }    return names.map(name => {        url.searchParams.set("name", name)        //  ~~~~~~~~~~~~        // error!        // Property 'searchParams' does not exist on type 'string | URL'.        return url.toString();    });}
```



Here, TypeScript decided that it wasn’t “safe” to assume that `url` was actually a `URL` object in our callback function because it was mutated elsewhere;
however, in this instance, that arrow function is always created after that assignment to `url`, and it’s also the last assignment to `url`.

TypeScript 5.4 takes advantage of this to make narrowing a little smarter.
When parameters and `let` variables are used in non- hoisted functions, the type-checker will look for a last assignment point.
If one is found, TypeScript can safely narrow from outside the containing function.
What that means is the above example just works now.

Note that narrowing analysis doesn’t kick in if the variable is assigned anywhere in a nested function.
This is because there’s no way to know for sure whether the function will be called later.



```id
tsfunction printValueLater(value: string | undefined) {    if (value === undefined) {        value = "missing!";    }    setTimeout(() => {        // Modifying 'value', even in a way that shouldn't affect        // its type, will invalidate type refinements in closures.        value = value;    }, 500);    setTimeout(() => {        console.log(value.toUpperCase());        //          ~~~~~        // error! 'value' is possibly 'undefined'.    }, 1000);}
```



This should make lots of typical JavaScript code easier to express.
You can read more about the change on GitHub .

## The `NoInfer` Utility Type

When calling generic functions, TypeScript is able to infer type arguments from whatever you pass in.



```id
tsfunction doSomething<T>(arg: T) {    // ...}// We can explicitly say that 'T' should be 'string'.doSomething<string>("hello!");// We can also just let the type of 'T' get inferred.doSomething("hello!");
```



One challenge, however, is that it is not always clear what the “best” type is to infer.
This might lead to TypeScript rejecting valid calls, accepting questionable calls, or just reporting worse error messages when it catches a bug.

For example, let’s imagine a `createStreetLight` function that takes a list of color names, along with an optional default color.



```id
tsfunction createStreetLight<C extends string>(colors: C[], defaultColor?: C) {    // ...}createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "red");
```



What happens when we pass in a `defaultColor` that wasn’t in the original `colors` array?
In this function, `colors` is supposed to be the “source of truth” and describe what can be passed to `defaultColor`.



```id
ts// Oops! This is undesirable, but is allowed!createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "blue");
```



In this call, type inference decided that `"blue"` was just as valid of a type as `"red"` or `"yellow"` or `"green"`.
So instead of rejecting the call, TypeScript infers the type of `C` as `"red" | "yellow" | "green" | "blue"`.
You might say that inference just blue up in our faces!

One way people currently deal with this is to add a separate type parameter that’s bounded by the existing type parameter.



```id
tsfunction createStreetLight<C extends string, D extends C>(colors: C[], defaultColor?: D) {}createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "blue");//                                            ~~~~~~// error!// Argument of type '"blue"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"red" | "yellow" | "green" | undefined'.
```



This works, but is a little bit awkward because `D` probably won’t be used anywhere else in the signature for `createStreetLight`.
While not bad in this case , using a type parameter only once in a signature is often a code smell.

That’s why TypeScript 5.4 introduces a new `NoInfer ` utility type.
Surrounding a type in `NoInfer ` gives a signal to TypeScript not to dig in and match against the inner types to find candidates for type inference.

Using `NoInfer`, we can rewrite `createStreetLight` as something like this:



```id
tsfunction createStreetLight<C extends string>(colors: C[], defaultColor?: NoInfer<C>) {    // ...}createStreetLight(["red", "yellow", "green"], "blue");//                                            ~~~~~~// error!// Argument of type '"blue"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"red" | "yellow" | "green" | undefined'.
```



Excluding the type of `defaultColor` from being explored for inference means that `"blue"` never ends up as an inference candidate, and the type-checker can reject it.

You can see the specific changes in the implementing pull request , along with the initial implementation provided thanks to Mateusz Burzyński !

## `Object.groupBy` and `Map.groupBy`

TypeScript 5.4 adds declarations for JavaScript’s new `Object.groupBy` and `Map.groupBy` static methods.

`Object.groupBy` takes an iterable, and a function that decides which “group” each element should be placed in.
The function needs to make a “key” for each distinct group, and `Object.groupBy` uses that key to make an object where every key maps to an array with the original element in it.

So the following JavaScript:



```id
jsconst array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];const myObj = Object.groupBy(array, (num, index) => {    return num % 2 === 0 ? "even": "odd";});
```



is basically equivalent to writing this:



```id
jsconst myObj = {    even: [0, 2, 4],    odd: [1, 3, 5],};
```



`Map.groupBy` is similar, but produces a `Map` instead of a plain object.
This might be more desirable if you need the guarantees of `Map`s, you’re dealing with APIs that expect `Map`s, or you need to use any kind of key for grouping - not just keys that can be used as property names in JavaScript.



```id
jsconst myObj = Map.groupBy(array, (num, index) => {    return num % 2 === 0 ? "even" : "odd";});
```



and just as before, you could have created `myObj` in an equivalent way:



```id
jsconst myObj = new Map();myObj.set("even", [0, 2, 4]);myObj.set("odd", [1, 3, 5]);
```



Note that in the above example of `Object.groupBy`, the object produced uses all optional properties.



```id
tsinterface EvenOdds {    even?: number[];    odd?: number[];}const myObj: EvenOdds = Object.groupBy(...);myObj.even;//    ~~~~// Error to access this under 'strictNullChecks'.
```



This is because there’s no way to guarantee in a general way that all the keys were produced by `groupBy`.

Note also that these methods are only accessible by configuring your `target` to `esnext` or adjusting your `lib` settings.
We expect they will eventually be available under a stable `es2024` target.

We’d like to extend a thanks to Kevin Gibbons for adding the declarations to these `groupBy` methods .

## Support for `require()` calls in `--moduleResolution bundler` and `--module preserve`

TypeScript has a `moduleResolution` option called `bundler` that is meant to model the way modern bundlers figure out which file an import path refers to.
One of the limitations of the option is that it had to be paired with `--module esnext`, making it impossible to use the `import ... = require(...)` syntax.



```id
ts// previously erroredimport myModule = require("module/path");
```



That might not seem like a big deal if you’re planning on just writing standard ECMAScript `import`s, but there’s a difference when using a package with conditional exports .

In TypeScript 5.4, `require()` can now be used when setting the `module` setting to a new option called `preserve`.

Between `--module preserve` and `--moduleResolution bundler`, the two more accurately model what bundlers and runtimes like Bun will allow, and how they’ll perform module lookups.
In fact, when using `--module preserve`, the `bundler` option will be implicitly set for `--moduleResolution` (along with `--esModuleInterop` and `--resolveJsonModule`)



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "module": "preserve",        // ^ also implies:        // "moduleResolution": "bundler",        // "esModuleInterop": true,        // "resolveJsonModule": true,        // ...    }}
```



Under `--module preserve`, an ECMAScript `import` will always be emitted as-is, and `import ... = require(...)` will be emitted as a `require()` call (though in practice you may not even use TypeScript for emit, since it’s likely you’ll be using a bundler for your code).
This holds true regardless of the file extension of the containing file.
So the output of this code:



```id
tsimport * as foo from "some-package/foo";import bar = require("some-package/bar");
```



should look something like this:



```id
jsimport * as foo from "some-package/foo";var bar = require("some-package/bar");
```



What this also means is that the syntax you choose directs how conditional exports are matched.
So in the above example, if the `package.json` of `some-package` looks like this:



```id
json{  "name": "some-package",  "version": "0.0.1",  "exports": {    "./foo": {        "import": "./esm/foo-from-import.mjs",        "require": "./cjs/foo-from-require.cjs"    },    "./bar": {        "import": "./esm/bar-from-import.mjs",        "require": "./cjs/bar-from-require.cjs"    }  }}
```



TypeScript will resolve these paths to `[...]/some-package/esm/foo-from-import.mjs` and `[...]/some-package/cjs/bar-from-require.cjs`.

For more information, you can read up on these new settings here .

## Checked Import Attributes and Assertions

Import attributes and assertions are now checked against the global `ImportAttributes` type.
This means that runtimes can now more accurately describe the import attributes



```id
ts// In some global file.interface ImportAttributes {    type: "json";}// In some other moduleimport * as ns from "foo" with { type: "not-json" };//                                     ~~~~~~~~~~// error!//// Type '{ type: "not-json"; }' is not assignable to type 'ImportAttributes'.//  Types of property 'type' are incompatible.//    Type '"not-json"' is not assignable to type '"json"'.
```



 This change was provided thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk .

## Quick Fix for Adding Missing Parameters

TypeScript now has a quick fix to add a new parameter to functions that are called with too many arguments.

 

 

This can be useful when threading a new argument through several existing functions, which can be cumbersome today.

 This quick fix was provided courtsey of Oleksandr Tarasiuk .

## Upcoming Changes from TypeScript 5.0 Deprecations

TypeScript 5.0 deprecated the following options and behaviors:

 `charset`

- `target: ES3`

- `importsNotUsedAsValues`

- `noImplicitUseStrict`

- `noStrictGenericChecks`

- `keyofStringsOnly`

- `suppressExcessPropertyErrors`

- `suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors`

- `out`

- `preserveValueImports`

- `prepend` in project references

- implicitly OS-specific `newLine`

To continue using them, developers using TypeScript 5.0 and other more recent versions have had to specify a new option called `ignoreDeprecations` with the value `"5.0"`.

However, TypScript 5.4 will be the last version in which these will continue to function as normal.
By TypeScript 5.5 (likely June 2024), these will become hard errors, and code using them will need to be migrated away.

For more information, you can read up on this plan on GitHub , which contains suggestions in how to best adapt your codebase.

## Notable Behavioral Changes

This section highlights a set of noteworthy changes that should be acknowledged and understood as part of any upgrade.
Sometimes it will highlight deprecations, removals, and new restrictions.
It can also contain bug fixes that are functionally improvements, but which can also affect an existing build by introducing new errors.

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on type-checking your codebase.
For more information, see the DOM updates for TypeScript 5.4 .

### More Accurate Conditional Type Constraints

The following code no longer allows the second variable declaration in the function `foo`.



```id
tstype IsArray<T> = T extends any[] ? true : false;function foo<U extends object>(x: IsArray<U>) {    let first: true = x;    // Error    let second: false = x;  // Error, but previously wasn't}
```



Previously, when TypeScript checked the initializer for `second`, it needed to determine whether `IsArray ` was assignable to the unit type `false`.
While `IsArray ` isn’t compatible any obvious way, TypeScript looks at the constraint of that type as well.
In a conditional type like `T extends Foo ? TrueBranch : FalseBranch`, where `T` is generic, the type system would look at the constraint of `T`, substitute it in for `T` itself, and decide on either the true or false branch.

But this behavior was inaccurate because it was overly eager.
Even if the constraint of `T` isn’t assignable to `Foo`, that doesn’t mean that it won’t be instantiated with something that is.
And so the more correct behavior is to produce a union type for the constraint of the conditional type in cases where it can’t be proven that `T` never or always extends `Foo.`

TypeScript 5.4 adopts this more accurate behavior.
What this means in practice is that you may begin to find that some conditional type instances are no longer compatible with their branches.

 You can read about the specific changes here .

### More Aggressive Reduction of Intersections Between Type Variables and Primitive Types

TypeScript now reduces intersections with type variables and primitives more aggressively, depending on how the type variable’s constraint overlaps with those primitives.



```id
tsdeclare function intersect<T, U>(x: T, y: U): T & U;function foo<T extends "abc" | "def">(x: T, str: string, num: number) {    // Was 'T & string', now is just 'T'    let a = intersect(x, str);    // Was 'T & number', now is just 'never'    let b = intersect(x, num)    // Was '(T & "abc") | (T & "def")', now is just 'T'    let c = Math.random() < 0.5 ?        intersect(x, "abc") :        intersect(x, "def");}
```



For more information, see the change here .

### Improved Checking Against Template Strings with Interpolations

TypeScript now more accurately checks whether or not strings are assignable to the placeholder slots of a template string type.



```id
tsfunction a<T extends {id: string}>() {    let x: `-${keyof T & string}`;        // Used to error, now doesn't.    x = "-id";}
```



This behavior is more desirable, but may cause breaks in code using constructs like conditional types, where these rule changes are easy to witness.

 See this change for more details.

### Errors When Type-Only Imports Conflict with Local Values

Previously, TypeScript would permit the following code under `isolatedModules` if the import to `Something` only referred to a type.



```id
tsimport { Something } from "./some/path";let Something = 123;
```



However, it’s not safe for single-file compilers to assume whether it’s “safe” to drop the `import`, even if the code is guaranteed to fail at runtime.
In TypeScript 5.4, this code will trigger an error like the following:



```
Import 'Something' conflicts with local value, so must be declared with a type-only import when 'isolatedModules' is enabled.
```



The fix should be to either make a local rename, or, as the error states, add the `type` modifier to the import:



```id
tsimport type { Something } from "./some/path";// orimport { type Something } from "./some/path";
```



 See more information on the change itself .

### New Enum Assignability Restrictions

When two enums have the same declared names and enum member names, they were previously always considered compatible;
however, when the values were known, TypeScript would silently allow them to have differing values.

TypeScript 5.4 tightens this restriction by requiring the values to be identical when they are known.



```id
tsnamespace First {    export enum SomeEnum {        A = 0,        B = 1,    }}namespace Second {    export enum SomeEnum {        A = 0,        B = 2,    }}function foo(x: First.SomeEnum, y: Second.SomeEnum) {    // Both used to be compatible - no longer the case,    // TypeScript errors with something like:    //    //  Each declaration of 'SomeEnum.B' differs in its value, where '1' was expected but '2' was given.    x = y;    y = x;}
```



Additionally, there are new restrictions for when one of the enum members does not have a statically known value.
In these cases, the other enum must at least be implicitly numeric (e.g. it has no statically resolved initializer), or it is explicitly numeric (meaning TypeScript could resolve the value to something numeric).
Practically speaking, what this means is that string enum members are only ever compatible with other string enums of the same value.



```id
tsnamespace First {    export declare enum SomeEnum {        A,        B,    }}namespace Second {    export declare enum SomeEnum {        A,        B = "some known string",    }}function foo(x: First.SomeEnum, y: Second.SomeEnum) {    // Both used to be compatible - no longer the case,    // TypeScript errors with something like:    //    //  One value of 'SomeEnum.B' is the string '"some known string"', and the other is assumed to be an unknown numeric value.    x = y;    y = x;}
```



For more information, see the pull request that introduced this change .

### Name Restrictions on Enum Members

TypeScript no longer allows enum members to use the names `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, or `NaN`.



```id
ts// Errors on all of these:////  An enum member cannot have a numeric name.enum E {    Infinity = 0,    "-Infinity" = 1,    NaN = 2,}
```



 See more details here .

### Better Mapped Type Preservation Over Tuples with `any` Rest Elements

Previously, applying a mapped type with `any` into a tuple would create an `any` element type.
This is undesirable and is now fixed.



```id
tsPromise.all(["", ...([] as any)])    .then((result) => {        const head = result[0];       // 5.3: any, 5.4: string        const tail = result.slice(1); // 5.3 any, 5.4: any[]    });
```



For more information, see the fix along with the follow-on discussion around behavioral changes and further tweaks .

### Emit Changes

While not a breaking change per se, developers may have implicitly taken dependencies on TypeScript’s JavaScript or declaration emit outputs.
The following are notable changes.

- Preserve type parameter names more often when shadowed 

- Move complex parameter lists of async function into downlevel generator body 

- Do not remove binding alias in function declarations 

- ImportAttributes should go through the same emit phases when in an ImportTypeNode

TypeScript: Documentation - TypeScript 4.6

# TypeScript 4.6

 

## Allowing Code in Constructors Before `super()`

In JavaScript classes it’s mandatory to call `super()` before referring to `this`.
TypeScript enforces this as well, though it was a bit too strict in how it ensured this.
In TypeScript, it was previously an error to contain any code at the beginning of a constructor if its containing class had any property initializers.



```id
tsclass Base {  // ...}class Derived extends Base {  someProperty = true;  constructor() {    // error!    // have to call 'super()' first because it needs to initialize 'someProperty'.    doSomeStuff();    super();  }}
```



This made it cheap to check that `super()` gets called before `this` is referenced, but it ended up rejecting a lot of valid code.
TypeScript 4.6 is now much more lenient in that check and permits other code to run before `super()`., all while still ensuring that `super()` occurs at the top-level before any references to `this`.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Joshua Goldberg for patiently working with us to land this change !

## Control Flow Analysis for Destructured Discriminated Unions

TypeScript is able to narrow types based on what’s called a discriminant property.
For example, in the following code snippet, TypeScript is able to narrow the type of `action` based on every time we check against the value of `kind`.



```id
tstype Action =  | { kind: "NumberContents"; payload: number }  | { kind: "StringContents"; payload: string };function processAction(action: Action) {  if (action.kind === "NumberContents") {    // `action.payload` is a number here.    let num = action.payload * 2;    // ...  } else if (action.kind === "StringContents") {    // `action.payload` is a string here.    const str = action.payload.trim();    // ...  }}
```



This lets us work with objects that can hold different data, but a common field tells us which data those objects have.

This is very common in TypeScript; however, depending on your preferences, you might have wanted to destructure `kind` and `payload` in the example above.
Perhaps something like the following:



```id
tstype Action =  | { kind: "NumberContents"; payload: number }  | { kind: "StringContents"; payload: string };function processAction(action: Action) {  const { kind, payload } = action;  if (kind === "NumberContents") {    let num = payload * 2;    // ...  } else if (kind === "StringContents") {    const str = payload.trim();    // ...  }}
```



Previously TypeScript would error on these - once `kind` and `payload` were extracted from the same object into variables, they were considered totally independent.

In TypeScript 4.6, this just works!

When destructuring individual properties into a `const` declaration, or when destructuring a parameter into variables that are never assigned to, TypeScript will check for if the destructured type is a discriminated union.
If it is, TypeScript can now narrow the types of variables depending on checks of other variables
So in our example, a check on `kind` narrows the type of `payload`.

For more information, see the pull request that implemented this analysis .

## Improved Recursion Depth Checks

TypeScript has some interesting challenges due to the fact that it’s built on a structural type system that also provides generics.

In a structural type system, object types are compatible based on the members they have.



```id
tsinterface Source {  prop: string;}interface Target {  prop: number;}function check(source: Source, target: Target) {  target = source;  // error!  // Type 'Source' is not assignable to type 'Target'.  //   Types of property 'prop' are incompatible.  //     Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.}
```



Notice that whether or not `Source` is compatible with `Target` has to do with whether their properties are assignable.
In this case, that’s just `prop`.

When you introduce generics into this, there are some harder questions to answer.
For instance, is a `Source ` assignable to a `Target ` in the following case?



```id
tsinterface Source<T> {  prop: Source<Source<T>>;}interface Target<T> {  prop: Target<Target<T>>;}function check(source: Source<string>, target: Target<number>) {  target = source;}
```



In order to answer that, TypeScript needs to check whether the types of `prop` are compatible.
That leads to the another question: is a `Source >` assignable to a `Target >`?
To answer that, TypeScript checks whether `prop` is compatible for those types, and ends up checking whether `Source >>` is assignable to `Target >>`.
Keep going for a bit, and you might notice that the type infinitely expands the more you dig in.

TypeScript has a few heuristics here - if a type appears to be infinitely expanding after encountering a certain depth check, then it considers that the types could be compatible.
This is usually enough, but embarrassingly there were some false-negatives that this wouldn’t catch.



```id
tsinterface Foo<T> {  prop: T;}declare let x: Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<string>>>>>>;declare let y: Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<string>>>>>;x = y;
```



A human reader can see that `x` and `y` should be incompatible in the above example.
While the types are deeply nested, that’s just a consequence of how they were declared.
The heuristic was meant to capture cases where deeply-nested types were generated through exploring the types, not from when a developer wrote that type out themselves.

TypeScript 4.6 is now able to distinguish these cases, and correctly errors on the last example.
Additionally, because the language is no longer concerned with false-positives from explicitly-written types, TypeScript can conclude that a type is infinitely expanding much earlier, and save a bunch of work in checking for type compatibility.
As a result, libraries on DefinitelyTyped like `redux-immutable`, `react-lazylog`, and `yup` saw a 50% reduction in check-time.

You may already have this change because it was cherry-picked into TypeScript 4.5.3, but it is a notable feature of TypeScript 4.6 which you can read up more about here .

## Indexed Access Inference Improvements

TypeScript now can correctly infer to indexed access types which immediately index into a mapped object type.



```id
tsinterface TypeMap {  number: number;  string: string;  boolean: boolean;}type UnionRecord<P extends keyof TypeMap> = {  [K in P]: {    kind: K;    v: TypeMap[K];    f: (p: TypeMap[K]) => void;  };}[P];function processRecord<K extends keyof TypeMap>(record: UnionRecord<K>) {  record.f(record.v);}// This call used to have issues - now works!processRecord({  kind: "string",  v: "hello!",  // 'val' used to implicitly have the type 'string | number | boolean',  // but now is correctly inferred to just 'string'.  f: (val) => {    console.log(val.toUpperCase());  },});
```



This pattern was already supported and allowed TypeScript to understand that the call to `record.f(record.v)` is valid, but previously the call to `processRecord` would give poor inference results for `val`

TypeScript 4.6 improves this so that no type assertions are necessary within the call to `processRecord`.

For more information, you can read up on the pull request .

## Control Flow Analysis for Dependent Parameters

A signature can be declared with a rest parameter whose type is a discriminated union of tuples.



```id
tsfunction func(...args: ["str", string] | ["num", number]) {  // ...}
```



What this says is that the arguments to `func` depends entirely on the first argument.
When the first argument is the string `"str"`, then its second argument has to be a `string`.
When its first argument is the string `"num"`, its second argument has to be a `number`.

In cases where TypeScript infers the type of a function from a signature like this, TypeScript can now narrow parameters that depend on each other.



```id
tstype Func = (...args: ["a", number] | ["b", string]) => void;const f1: Func = (kind, payload) => {  if (kind === "a") {    payload.toFixed(); // 'payload' narrowed to 'number'  }  if (kind === "b") {    payload.toUpperCase(); // 'payload' narrowed to 'string'  }};f1("a", 42);f1("b", "hello");
```



For more information, see the change on GitHub .

## `--target es2022`

TypeScript’s `--target` option now supports `es2022`.
This means features like class fields now have a stable output target where they can be preserved.
It also means that new built-in functionality like the `at()` method on `Array`s , `Object.hasOwn` , or the `cause` option on `new Error` can be used either with this new `--target` setting, or with `--lib es2022`.

This functionality was implemented by Kagami Sascha Rosylight (saschanaz) over several PRs, and we’re grateful for that contribution!

## Removed Unnecessary Arguments in `react-jsx`

Previously, when compiling code like the following in `--jsx react-jsx`



```id
tsxexport const el = <div>foo</div>;
```



TypeScript would produce the following JavaScript code:



```id
jsximport { jsx as _jsx } from "react/jsx-runtime";export const el = _jsx("div", { children: "foo" }, void 0);
```



That last `void 0` argument is unnecessary in this emit mode, and removing it can improve bundle sizes.



```id
diff- export const el = _jsx("div", { children: "foo" }, void 0);+ export const el = _jsx("div", { children: "foo" });
```



Thanks to a pull request from Alexander Tarasyuk , TypeScript 4.6 now drops the `void 0` argument.

## JSDoc Name Suggestions

In JSDoc, you can document parameters using an `@param` tag.



```id
js/** * @param x The first operand * @param y The second operand */function add(x, y) {  return x + y;}
```



But what happens when these comments fall out of date?
What if we rename `x` and `y` to `a` and `b`?



```id
js/** * @param x {number} The first operand * @param y {number} The second operand */function add(a, b) {  return a + b;}
```



Previously TypeScript would only tell you about this when performing type-checking on JavaScript files - when using either the `checkJs` option, or adding a `// @ts-check` comment to the top of your file.

You can now get similar information for TypeScript files in your editor!
TypeScript now provides suggestions for when parameter names don’t match between your function and its JSDoc comment.

## More Syntax and Binding Errors in JavaScript

TypeScript has expanded its set of syntax and binding errors in JavaScript files.
You’ll see these new errors if you open JavaScript files in an editor like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, or if you run JavaScript code through the TypeScript compiler - even if you don’t turn on `checkJs` or add a `// @ts-check` comment to the top of your files.

As one example, if you have two declarations of a `const` in the same scope of a JavaScript file, TypeScript will now issue an error on those declarations.



```id
tsconst foo = 1234;//    ~~~// error: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'foo'.// ...const foo = 5678;//    ~~~// error: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'foo'.
```



As another example, TypeScript will let you know if a modifier is being incorrectly used.



```id
tsfunction container() {    export function foo() {//  ~~~~~~// error: Modifiers cannot appear here.    }}
```



These errors can be disabled by adding a `// @ts-nocheck` at the top of your file, but we’re interested in hearing some early feedback about how it works for your JavaScript workflow.
You can easily try it out for Visual Studio Code by installing the TypeScript and JavaScript Nightly Extension , and read up more on the first and second pull requests.

## TypeScript Trace Analyzer

Occasionally, teams may encounter types that are computationally expensive to create and compare against other types.
 TypeScript has a `--generateTrace` flag to help identify some of those expensive types, or sometimes help diagnose issues in the TypeScript compiler.
While the information generated by `--generateTrace` can be useful (especially with some information added in TypeScript 4.6), it can often be hard to read in existing trace visualizers.

We recently published a tool called @typescript/analyze-trace to get a more digestible view of this information.
While we don’t expect everyone to need `analyze-trace`, we think it can come in handy for any team that is running into build performance issues with TypeScript .

For more information, see the `analyze-trace` tool’s repo .

## Breaking Changes

### Object Rests Drop Unspreadable Members from Generic Objects

Object rest expressions now drop members that appear to be unspreadable on generic objects.
In the following example…



```id
tsclass Thing {  someProperty = 42;  someMethod() {    // ...  }}function foo<T extends Thing>(x: T) {  let { someProperty, ...rest } = x;  // Used to work, is now an error!  // Property 'someMethod' does not exist on type 'Omit<T, "someProperty" | "someMethod">'.  rest.someMethod();}
```



the variable `rest` used to have the type `Omit ` because TypeScript would strictly analyze which other properties were destructured.
This doesn’t model how `...rest` would work in a destructuring from a non-generic type because `someMethod` would typically be dropped as well.
In TypeScript 4.6, the type of `rest` is `Omit `.

This can also come up in cases when destructuring from `this`.
When destructuring `this` using a `...rest` element, unspreadable and non-public members are now dropped, which is consistent with destructuring instances of a class in other places.



```id
tsclass Thing {  someProperty = 42;  someMethod() {    // ...  }  someOtherMethod() {    let { someProperty, ...rest } = this;    // Used to work, is now an error!    // Property 'someMethod' does not exist on type 'Omit<T, "someProperty" | "someMethod">'.    rest.someMethod();  }}
```



For more details, see the corresponding change here .

### JavaScript Files Always Receive Grammar and Binding Errors

Previously, TypeScript would ignore most grammar errors in JavaScript apart from accidentally using TypeScript syntax in a JavaScript file.
TypeScript now shows JavaScript syntax and binding errors in your file, such as using incorrect modifiers, duplicate declarations, and more.
These will typically be most apparent in Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio, but can also occur when running JavaScript code through the TypeScript compiler.

You can explicitly turn these errors off by inserting a `// @ts-nocheck` comment at the top of your file.

# TypeScript 5.3

 

## Import Attributes

TypeScript 5.3 supports the latest updates to the import attributes proposal.

One use-case of import attributes is to provide information about the expected format of a module to the runtime.



```id
ts// We only want this to be interpreted as JSON,// not a runnable/malicious JavaScript file with a `.json` extension.import obj from "./something.json" with { type: "json" };
```



The contents of these attributes are not checked by TypeScript since they’re host-specific, and are simply left alone so that browsers and runtimes can handle them (and possibly error).



```id
ts// TypeScript is fine with this.// But your browser? Probably not.import * as foo from "./foo.js" with { type: "fluffy bunny" };
```



Dynamic `import()` calls can also use import attributes through a second argument.



```id
tsconst obj = await import("./something.json", {    with: { type: "json" }});
```



The expected type of that second argument is defined by a type called `ImportCallOptions`, which by default just expects a property called `with`.

Note that import attributes are an evolution of an earlier proposal called “import assertions”, which were implemented in TypeScript 4.5 .
The most obvious difference is the use of the `with` keyword over the `assert` keyword.
But the less-visible difference is that runtimes are now free to use attributes to guide the resolution and interpretation of import paths, whereas import assertions could only assert some characteristics after loading a module.

Over time, TypeScript will be deprecating the old syntax for import assertions in favor of the proposed syntax for import attributes.
Existing code using `assert` should migrate towards the `with` keyword.
New code that needs an import attribute should use `with` exclusively.

We’d like to thank Oleksandr Tarasiuk for implementing this proposal !
And we’d also like to call out Wenlu Wang for their implementation of import assertions !

## Stable Support `resolution-mode` in Import Types

In TypeScript 4.7, TypeScript added support for a `resolution-mode` attribute in `/// ` to control whether a specifier should be resolved via `import` or `require` semantics.



```id
ts/// <reference types="pkg" resolution-mode="require" />// or/// <reference types="pkg" resolution-mode="import" />
```



A corresponding field was added to import assertions on type-only imports as well;
however, it was only supported in nightly versions of TypeScript.
The rationale was that in spirit, import assertions were not intended to guide module resolution.
So this feature was shipped experimentally in a nightly-only mode to get more feedback.

But given that import attributes can guide resolution, and that we’ve seen reasonable use-cases, TypeScript 5.3 now supports the `resolution-mode` attribute for `import type`.



```id
ts// Resolve `pkg` as if we were importing with a `require()`import type { TypeFromRequire } from "pkg" with {    "resolution-mode": "require"};// Resolve `pkg` as if we were importing with an `import`import type { TypeFromImport } from "pkg" with {    "resolution-mode": "import"};export interface MergedType extends TypeFromRequire, TypeFromImport {}
```



These import attributes can also be used on `import()` types.



```id
tsexport type TypeFromRequire =    import("pkg", { with: { "resolution-mode": "require" } }).TypeFromRequire;export type TypeFromImport =    import("pkg", { with: { "resolution-mode": "import" } }).TypeFromImport;export interface MergedType extends TypeFromRequire, TypeFromImport {}
```



For more information, check out the change here 

## `resolution-mode` Supported in All Module Modes

Previously, using `resolution-mode` was only allowed under the `moduleResolution` options `node16` and `nodenext`.
To make it easier to look up modules specifically for type purposes, `resolution-mode` now works appropriately in all other `moduleResolution` options like `bundler`, `node10`, and simply doesn’t error under `classic`.

For more information, see the implementing pull request .

## `switch (true)` Narrowing

TypeScript 5.3 now can perform narrowing based on conditions in each `case` clause within a `switch (true)`.



```id
tsfunction f(x: unknown) {    switch (true) {        case typeof x === "string":            // 'x' is a 'string' here            console.log(x.toUpperCase());            // falls through...        case Array.isArray(x):            // 'x' is a 'string | any[]' here.            console.log(x.length);            // falls through...        default:          // 'x' is 'unknown' here.          // ...    }}
```



 This feature was spearheaded initial work by Mateusz Burzyński 
We’d like to extend a “thank you!” for this contribution.

## Narrowing On Comparisons to Booleans

Occasionally you may find yourself performing a direct comparison with `true` or `false` in a condition.
Usually these are unnecessary comparisons, but you might prefer it as a point of style, or to avoid certain issues around JavaScript truthiness.
Regardless, previously TypeScript just didn’t recognize such forms when performing narrowing.

TypeScript 5.3 now keeps up and understands these expressions when narrowing variables.



```id
tsinterface A {    a: string;}interface B {    b: string;}type MyType = A | B;function isA(x: MyType): x is A {    return "a" in x;}function someFn(x: MyType) {    if (isA(x) === true) {        console.log(x.a); // works!    }}
```



We’d like to thank Mateusz Burzyński for the pull request that implemented this.

## `instanceof` Narrowing Through `Symbol.hasInstance`

A slightly esoteric feature of JavaScript is that it is possible to override the behavior of the `instanceof` operator.
To do so, the value on the right side of the `instanceof` operator needs to have a specific method named by `Symbol.hasInstance`.



```id
jsclass Weirdo {    static [Symbol.hasInstance](testedValue) {        // wait, what?        return testedValue === undefined;    }}// falseconsole.log(new Thing() instanceof Weirdo);// trueconsole.log(undefined instanceof Weirdo);
```



To better model this behavior in `instanceof`, TypeScript now checks if such a `[Symbol.hasInstance]` method exists and is declared as a type predicate function.
If it does, the tested value on the left side of the `instanceof` operator will be narrowed appropriately by that type predicate.



```id
tsinterface PointLike {    x: number;    y: number;}class Point implements PointLike {    x: number;    y: number;    constructor(x: number, y: number) {        this.x = x;        this.y = y;    }    distanceFromOrigin() {        return Math.sqrt(this.x ** 2 + this.y ** 2);    }    static [Symbol.hasInstance](val: unknown): val is PointLike {        return !!val && typeof val === "object" &&            "x" in val && "y" in val &&            typeof val.x === "number" &&            typeof val.y === "number";    }}function f(value: unknown) {    if (value instanceof Point) {        // Can access both of these - correct!        value.x;        value.y;        // Can't access this - we have a 'PointLike',        // but we don't *actually* have a 'Point'.        value.distanceFromOrigin();    }}
```



As you can see in this example, `Point` defines its own `[Symbol.hasInstance]` method.
It actually acts as a custom type guard over a separate type called `PointLike`.
In the function `f`, we were able to narrow `value` down to a `PointLike` with `instanceof`, but not a `Point`.
That means that we can access the properties `x` and `y`, but not the method `distanceFromOrigin`.

For more information, you can read up on this change here .

## Checks for `super` Property Accesses on Instance Fields

In JavaScript, it’s possible to access a declaration in a base class through the `super` keyword.



```id
jsclass Base {    someMethod() {        console.log("Base method called!");    }}class Derived extends Base {    someMethod() {        console.log("Derived method called!");        super.someMethod();    }}new Derived().someMethod();// Prints://   Derived method called!//   Base method called!
```



This is different from writing something like `this.someMethod()`, since that could invoke an overridden method.
This is a subtle distinction, made more subtle by the fact that often the two can be interchangeable if a declaration is never overridden at all.



```id
jsclass Base {    someMethod() {        console.log("someMethod called!");    }}class Derived extends Base {    someOtherMethod() {        // These act identically.        this.someMethod();        super.someMethod();    }}new Derived().someOtherMethod();// Prints://   someMethod called!//   someMethod called!
```



The problem is using them interchangeably is that `super` only works on members declared on the prototype — not instance properties.
That means that if you wrote `super.someMethod()`, but `someMethod` was defined as a field, you’d get a runtime error!



```id
tsclass Base {    someMethod = () => {        console.log("someMethod called!");    }}class Derived extends Base {    someOtherMethod() {        super.someMethod();    }}new Derived().someOtherMethod();// 💥// Doesn't work because 'super.someMethod' is 'undefined'.
```



TypeScript 5.3 now more-closely inspects `super` property accesses/method calls to see if they correspond to class fields.
If they do, we’ll now get a type-checking error.

 This check was contributed thanks to Jack Works !

## Interactive Inlay Hints for Types

TypeScript’s inlay hints now support jumping to the definition of types!
This makes it easier to casually navigate your code.

 

See more at the implementation here .

## Settings to Prefer `type` Auto-Imports

Previously when TypeScript generated auto-imports for something in a type position, it would add a `type` modifier based on your settings.
For example, when getting an auto-import on `Person` in the following:



```id
tsexport let p: Person
```



TypeScript’s editing experience would usually add an import for `Person` as:



```id
tsimport { Person } from "./types";export let p: Person
```



and under certain settings like `verbatimModuleSyntax`, it would add the `type` modifier:



```id
tsimport { type Person } from "./types";export let p: Person
```



However, maybe your codebase isn’t able to use some of these options; or you just have a preference for explicit `type` imports when possible.

 With a recent change , TypeScript now enables this to be an editor-specific option.
In Visual Studio Code, you can enable it in the UI under “TypeScript › Preferences: Prefer Type Only Auto Imports”, or as the JSON configuration option `typescript.preferences.preferTypeOnlyAutoImports`

 

## Optimizations by Skipping JSDoc Parsing

When running TypeScript via `tsc`, the compiler will now avoid parsing JSDoc.
This drops parsing time on its own, but also reduces memory usage to store comments along with time spent in garbage collection.
All-in-all, you should see slightly faster compiles and quicker feedback in `--watch` mode.

 The specific changes can be viewed here .

Because not every tool using TypeScript will need to store JSDoc (e.g. typescript-eslint and Prettier), this parsing strategy has been surfaced as part of the API itself.
This can enable these tools to gain the same memory and speed improvements we’ve brought to the TypeScript compiler.
The new options for comment parsing strategy are described in `JSDocParsingMode`.
More information is available on this pull request .

## Optimizations by Comparing Non-Normalized Intersections

In TypeScript, unions and intersections always follow a specific form, where intersections can’t contain union types.
That means that when we create an intersection over a union like `A & (B | C)`, that intersection will be normalized into `(A & B) | (A & C)`.
Still, in some cases the type system will maintain the original form for display purposes.

It turns out that the original form can be used for some clever fast-path comparisons between types.

For example, let’s say we have 

```
SomeType & (Type1 | Type2 | ... | Type99999NINE)
```

 and we want to see if that’s assignable to `SomeType`.
Recall that we don’t really have an intersection as our source type — we have a union that looks like 

```
(SomeType & Type1) | (SomeType & Type2) | ... |(SomeType & Type99999NINE)
```

.
When checking if a union is assignable to some target type, we have to check if every member of the union is assignable to the target type, and that can be very slow.

In TypeScript 5.3, we peek at the original intersection form that we were able to tuck away.
When we compare the types, we do a quick check to see if the target exists in any constituent of the source intersection.

For more information, see this pull request .

## Consolidation Between `tsserverlibrary.js` and `typescript.js`

TypeScript itself ships two library files: `tsserverlibrary.js` and `typescript.js`.
There are certain APIs available only in `tsserverlibrary.js` (like the `ProjectService` API), which may be useful to some importers.
Still, the two are distinct bundles with a lot of overlap, duplicating code in the package.
What’s more, it can be challenging to consistently use one over the other due to auto-imports or muscle memory.
Accidentally loading both modules is far too easy, and code may not work properly on a different instance of the API.
Even if it does work, loading a second bundle increases resource usage.

Given this, we’ve decided to consolidate the two.
`typescript.js` now contains what `tsserverlibrary.js` used to contain, and `tsserverlibrary.js` now simply re-exports `typescript.js`.
Comparing the before/after of this consolidation, we saw the following reduction in package size:

# TypeScript 4.5

 

## Supporting `lib` from `node_modules`

To ensure that TypeScript and JavaScript support works well out of the box, TypeScript bundles a series of declaration files (`.d.ts` files).
These declaration files represent the available APIs in the JavaScript language, and the standard browser DOM APIs.
While there are some reasonable defaults based on your `target` , you can pick and choose which declaration files your program uses by configuring the `lib` setting in the `tsconfig.json`.

There are two occasional downsides to including these declaration files with TypeScript though:

 When you upgrade TypeScript, you’re also forced to handle changes to TypeScript’s built-in declaration files, and this can be a challenge when the DOM APIs change as frequently as they do.

- It is hard to customize these files to match your needs with the needs of your project’s dependencies (e.g. if your dependencies declare that they use the DOM APIs, you might also be forced into using the DOM APIs).

TypeScript 4.5 introduces a way to override a specific built-in `lib` in a manner similar to how `@types/` support works.
When deciding which `lib` files TypeScript should include, it will first look for a scoped `@typescript/lib-*` package in `node_modules`.
For example, when including `dom` as an option in `lib`, TypeScript will use the types in `node_modules/@typescript/lib-dom` if available.

You can then use your package manager to install a specific package to take over for a given `lib`
For example, today TypeScript publishes versions of the DOM APIs on `@types/web`.
If you wanted to lock your project to a specific version of the DOM APIs, you could add this to your `package.json`:



```id
json{  "dependencies": {    "@typescript/lib-dom": "npm:@types/web"  }}
```



Then from 4.5 onwards, you can update TypeScript and your dependency manager’s lockfile will ensure that it uses the exact same version of the DOM types.
That means you get to update your types on your own terms.

We’d like to give a shout-out to saschanaz who has been extremely helpful and patient as we’ve been building out and experimenting with this feature.

For more information, you can see the implementation of this change .

## The `Awaited` Type and `Promise` Improvements

TypeScript 4.5 introduces a new utility type called the `Awaited` type.
This type is meant to model operations like `await` in `async` functions, or the `.then()` method on `Promise`s - specifically, the way that they recursively unwrap `Promise`s.



```id
ts// A = stringtype A = Awaited<Promise<string>>;// B = numbertype B = Awaited<Promise<Promise<number>>>;// C = boolean | numbertype C = Awaited<boolean | Promise<number>>;
```



The `Awaited` type can be helpful for modeling existing APIs, including JavaScript built-ins like `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, etc.
In fact, some of the problems around inference with `Promise.all` served as motivations for `Awaited`.
Here’s an example that fails in TypeScript 4.4 and earlier.



```id
tsdeclare function MaybePromise<T>(value: T): T | Promise<T> | PromiseLike<T>;async function doSomething(): Promise<[number, number]> {  const result = await Promise.all([MaybePromise(100), MaybePromise(200)]);  // Error!  //  //    [number | Promise<100>, number | Promise<200>]  //  // is not assignable to type  //  //    [number, number]  return result;}
```



Now `Promise.all` leverages the combination of certain features with `Awaited` to give much better inference results, and the above example works.

For more information, you can read about this change on GitHub .

## Template String Types as Discriminants

TypeScript 4.5 now can narrow values that have template string types, and also recognizes template string types as discriminants.

As an example, the following used to fail, but now successfully type-checks in TypeScript 4.5.



```id
tsexport interface Success {    type: `${string}Success`;    body: string;} export interface Error {    type: `${string}Error`;    message: string} export function handler(r: Success | Error) {    if (r.type === "HttpSuccess") {        const token = r.body;                     (parameter) r: Success    }}Try
```



For more information, see the change that enables this feature .

## `module es2022`

Thanks to Kagami S. Rosylight , TypeScript now supports a new `module` setting: `es2022`.
The main feature in `module es2022` is top-level `await`, meaning you can use `await` outside of `async` functions.
This was already supported in `--module esnext` (and now `--module nodenext` ), but `es2022` is the first stable target for this feature.

## Tail-Recursion Elimination on Conditional Types

TypeScript often needs to gracefully fail when it detects possibly infinite recursion, or any type expansions that can take a long time and affect your editor experience.
As a result, TypeScript has heuristics to make sure it doesn’t go off the rails when trying to pick apart an infinitely-deep type, or working with types that generate a lot of intermediate results.



```id
tstype InfiniteBox<T> = { item: InfiniteBox<T> };type Unpack<T> = T extends { item: infer U } ? Unpack<U> : T;// error: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.type Test = Unpack<InfiniteBox<number>>;
```



The above example is intentionally simple and useless, but there are plenty of types that are actually useful, and unfortunately trigger our heuristics.
As an example, the following `TrimLeft` type removes spaces from the beginning of a string-like type.
If given a string type that has a space at the beginning, it immediately feeds the remainder of the string back into `TrimLeft`.



```id
tstype TrimLeft<T extends string> =    T extends ` ${infer Rest}` ? TrimLeft<Rest> : T;// Test = "hello" | "world"type Test = TrimLeft<"   hello" | " world">;
```



This type can be useful, but if a string has 50 leading spaces, you’ll get an error.



```id
tstype TrimLeft<T extends string> =    T extends ` ${infer Rest}` ? TrimLeft<Rest> : T;// error: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.type Test = TrimLeft<"                                                oops">;
```



That’s unfortunate, because these kinds of types tend to be extremely useful in modeling operations on strings - for example, parsers for URL routers.
To make matters worse, a more useful type typically creates more type instantiations, and in turn has even more limitations on input length.

But there’s a saving grace: `TrimLeft` is written in a way that is tail-recursive in one branch.
When it calls itself again, it immediately returns the result and doesn’t do anything with it.
Because these types don’t need to create any intermediate results, they can be implemented more quickly and in a way that avoids triggering many of type recursion heuristics that are built into TypeScript.

That’s why TypeScript 4.5 performs some tail-recursion elimination on conditional types.
As long as one branch of a conditional type is simply another conditional type, TypeScript can avoid intermediate instantiations.
There are still heuristics to ensure that these types don’t go off the rails, but they are much more generous.

Keep in mind, the following type won’t be optimized, since it uses the result of a conditional type by adding it to a union.



```id
tstype GetChars<S> =    S extends `${infer Char}${infer Rest}` ? Char | GetChars<Rest> : never;
```



If you would like to make it tail-recursive, you can introduce a helper that takes an “accumulator” type parameter, just like with tail-recursive functions.



```id
tstype GetChars<S> = GetCharsHelper<S, never>;type GetCharsHelper<S, Acc> =    S extends `${infer Char}${infer Rest}` ? GetCharsHelper<Rest, Char | Acc> : Acc;
```



You can read up more on the implementation here .

## Disabling Import Elision

There are some cases where TypeScript can’t detect that you’re using an import.
For example, take the following code:



```id
tsimport { Animal } from "./animal.js";eval("console.log(new Animal().isDangerous())");
```



By default, TypeScript always removes this import because it appears to be unused.
In TypeScript 4.5, you can enable a new flag called `preserveValueImports` to prevent TypeScript from stripping out any imported values from your JavaScript outputs.
Good reasons to use `eval` are few and far between, but something very similar to this happens in Svelte:



```id
html<!-- A .svelte File --><script>  import { someFunc } from "./some-module.js";</script><button on:click="{someFunc}">Click me!</button>
```


 along with in Vue.js, using its `

## `using` Declarations and Explicit Resource Management

TypeScript 5.2 adds support for the upcoming Explicit Resource Management feature in ECMAScript.
Let’s explore some of the motivations and understand what the feature brings us.

It’s common to need to do some sort of “clean-up” after creating an object.
For example, you might need to close network connections, delete temporary files, or just free up some memory.

Let’s imagine a function that creates a temporary file, reads and writes to it for various operations, and then closes and deletes it.



```id
tsimport * as fs from "fs";export function doSomeWork() {    const path = ".some_temp_file";    const file = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    // use file...    // Close the file and delete it.    fs.closeSync(file);    fs.unlinkSync(path);}
```



This is fine, but what happens if we need to perform an early exit?



```id
tsexport function doSomeWork() {    const path = ".some_temp_file";    const file = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    // use file...    if (someCondition()) {        // do some more work...        // Close the file and delete it.        fs.closeSync(file);        fs.unlinkSync(path);        return;    }    // Close the file and delete it.    fs.closeSync(file);    fs.unlinkSync(path);}
```



We’re starting to see some duplication of clean-up which can be easy to forget.
We’re also not guaranteed to close and delete the file if an error gets thrown.
This could be solved by wrapping this all in a `try`/`finally` block.



```id
tsexport function doSomeWork() {    const path = ".some_temp_file";    const file = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    try {        // use file...        if (someCondition()) {            // do some more work...            return;        }    }    finally {        // Close the file and delete it.        fs.closeSync(file);        fs.unlinkSync(path);    }}
```



While this is more robust, it’s added quite a bit of “noise” to our code.
There are also other foot-guns we can run into if we start adding more clean-up logic to our `finally` block — for example, exceptions preventing other resources from being disposed.
This is what the explicit resource management proposal aims to solve.
The key idea of the proposal is to support resource disposal — this clean-up work we’re trying to deal with — as a first class idea in JavaScript.

This starts by adding a new built-in `symbol` called `Symbol.dispose`, and we can create objects with methods named by `Symbol.dispose`.
For convenience, TypeScript defines a new global type called `Disposable` which describes these.



```id
tsclass TempFile implements Disposable {    #path: string;    #handle: number;    constructor(path: string) {        this.#path = path;        this.#handle = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    }    // other methods    [Symbol.dispose]() {        // Close the file and delete it.        fs.closeSync(this.#handle);        fs.unlinkSync(this.#path);    }}
```



Later on we can call those methods.



```id
tsexport function doSomeWork() {    const file = new TempFile(".some_temp_file");    try {        // ...    }    finally {        file[Symbol.dispose]();    }}
```



Moving the clean-up logic to `TempFile` itself doesn’t buy us much;
we’ve basically just moved all the clean-up work from the `finally` block into a method, and that’s always been possible.
But having a well-known “name” for this method means that JavaScript can build other features on top of it.

That brings us to the first star of the feature: `using` declarations!
`using` is a new keyword that lets us declare new fixed bindings, kind of like `const`.
The key difference is that variables declared with `using` get their `Symbol.dispose` method called at the end of the scope!

So we could simply have written our code like this:



```id
tsexport function doSomeWork() {    using file = new TempFile(".some_temp_file");    // use file...    if (someCondition()) {        // do some more work...        return;    }}
```



Check it out — no `try`/`finally` blocks!
At least, none that we see.
Functionally, that’s exactly what `using` declarations will do for us, but we don’t have to deal with that.

You might be familiar with `using` declarations in C# , `with` statements in Python , or `try`-with-resource declarations in Java .
These are all similar to JavaScript’s new `using` keyword, and provide a similar explicit way to perform a “tear-down” of an object at the end of a scope.

`using` declarations do this clean-up at the very end of their containing scope or right before an “early return” like a `return` or a `throw`n error.
They also dispose in a first-in-last-out order like a stack.



```id
tsfunction loggy(id: string): Disposable {    console.log(`Creating ${id}`);    return {        [Symbol.dispose]() {            console.log(`Disposing ${id}`);        }    }}function func() {    using a = loggy("a");    using b = loggy("b");    {        using c = loggy("c");        using d = loggy("d");    }    using e = loggy("e");    return;    // Unreachable.    // Never created, never disposed.    using f = loggy("f");}func();// Creating a// Creating b// Creating c// Creating d// Disposing d// Disposing c// Creating e// Disposing e// Disposing b// Disposing a
```



`using` declarations are supposed to be resilient to exceptions;
if an error is thrown, it’s rethrown after disposal.
On the other hand, the body of your function might execute as expected, but the `Symbol.dispose` might throw.
In that case, that exception is rethrown as well.

But what happens if both the logic before and during disposal throws an error?
For those cases, `SuppressedError` has been introduced as a new subtype of `Error`.
It features a `suppressed` property that holds the last-thrown error, and an `error` property for the most-recently thrown error.



```id
tsclass ErrorA extends Error {    name = "ErrorA";}class ErrorB extends Error {    name = "ErrorB";}function throwy(id: string) {    return {        [Symbol.dispose]() {            throw new ErrorA(`Error from ${id}`);        }    };}function func() {    using a = throwy("a");    throw new ErrorB("oops!")}try {    func();}catch (e: any) {    console.log(e.name); // SuppressedError    console.log(e.message); // An error was suppressed during disposal.    console.log(e.error.name); // ErrorA    console.log(e.error.message); // Error from a    console.log(e.suppressed.name); // ErrorB    console.log(e.suppressed.message); // oops!}
```



You might have noticed that we’re using synchronous methods in these examples.
However, lots of resource disposal involves asynchronous operations, and we need to wait for those to complete before we continue running any other code.

That’s why there is also a new `Symbol.asyncDispose`, and it brings us to the next star of the show — `await using` declarations.
These are similar to `using` declarations, but the key is that they look up whose disposal must be `await`ed.
They use a different method named by `Symbol.asyncDispose`, though they can operate on anything with a `Symbol.dispose` as well.
For convenience, TypeScript also introduces a global type called `AsyncDisposable` that describes any object with an asynchronous dispose method.



```id
tsasync function doWork() {    // Do fake work for half a second.    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));}function loggy(id: string): AsyncDisposable {    console.log(`Constructing ${id}`);    return {        async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {            console.log(`Disposing (async) ${id}`);            await doWork();        },    }}async function func() {    await using a = loggy("a");    await using b = loggy("b");    {        await using c = loggy("c");        await using d = loggy("d");    }    await using e = loggy("e");    return;    // Unreachable.    // Never created, never disposed.    await using f = loggy("f");}func();// Constructing a// Constructing b// Constructing c// Constructing d// Disposing (async) d// Disposing (async) c// Constructing e// Disposing (async) e// Disposing (async) b// Disposing (async) a
```



Defining types in terms of `Disposable` and `AsyncDisposable` can make your code much easier to work with if you expect others to do tear-down logic consistently.
In fact, lots of existing types exist in the wild which have a `dispose()` or `close()` method.
For example, the Visual Studio Code APIs even define their own `Disposable` interface .
APIs in the browser and in runtimes like Node.js, Deno, and Bun might also choose to use `Symbol.dispose` and `Symbol.asyncDispose` for objects which already have clean-up methods, like file handles, connections, and more.

Now maybe this all sounds great for libraries, but a little bit heavy-weight for your scenarios.
If you’re doing a lot of ad-hoc clean-up, creating a new type might introduce a lot of over-abstraction and questions about best-practices.
For example, take our `TempFile` example again.



```id
tsclass TempFile implements Disposable {    #path: string;    #handle: number;    constructor(path: string) {        this.#path = path;        this.#handle = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    }    // other methods    [Symbol.dispose]() {        // Close the file and delete it.        fs.closeSync(this.#handle);        fs.unlinkSync(this.#path);    }}export function doSomeWork() {    using file = new TempFile(".some_temp_file");    // use file...    if (someCondition()) {        // do some more work...        return;    }}
```



All we wanted was to remember to call two functions — but was this the best way to write it?
Should we be calling `openSync` in the constructor, create an `open()` method, or pass in the handle ourselves?
Should we expose a method for every possible operation we need to perform, or should we just make the properties public?

That brings us to the final stars of the feature: `DisposableStack` and `AsyncDisposableStack`.
These objects are useful for doing both one-off clean-up, along with arbitrary amounts of cleanup.
A `DisposableStack` is an object that has several methods for keeping track of `Disposable` objects, and can be given functions for doing arbitrary clean-up work.
We can also assign them to `using` variables because — get this — they’re also `Disposable` !
So here’s how we could’ve written the original example.



```id
tsfunction doSomeWork() {    const path = ".some_temp_file";    const file = fs.openSync(path, "w+");    using cleanup = new DisposableStack();    cleanup.defer(() => {        fs.closeSync(file);        fs.unlinkSync(path);    });    // use file...    if (someCondition()) {        // do some more work...        return;    }    // ...}
```



Here, the `defer()` method just takes a callback, and that callback will be run once `cleanup` is disposed of.
Typically, `defer` (and other `DisposableStack` methods like `use` and `adopt`)
should be called immediately after creating a resource.
As the name suggests, `DisposableStack` disposes of everything it keeps track of like a stack, in a first-in-last-out order, so `defer`ing immediately after creating a value helps avoid odd dependency issues.
`AsyncDisposableStack` works similarly, but can keep track of `async` functions and `AsyncDisposable`s, and is itself an `AsyncDisposable.`

The `defer` method is similar in many ways to the `defer` keyword in Go , Swift , Zig , Odin , and others, where the conventions should be similar.

Because this feature is so recent, most runtimes will not support it natively.
To use it, you will need runtime polyfills for the following:

 `Symbol.dispose`

- `Symbol.asyncDispose`

- `DisposableStack`

- `AsyncDisposableStack`

- `SuppressedError`

However, if all you’re interested in is `using` and `await using`, you should be able to get away with only polyfilling the built-in `symbol`s.
Something as simple as the following should work for most cases:



```id
tsSymbol.dispose ??= Symbol("Symbol.dispose");Symbol.asyncDispose ??= Symbol("Symbol.asyncDispose");
```



You will also need to set your compilation `target` to `es2022` or below, and configure your `lib` setting to either include `"esnext"` or `"esnext.disposable"`.



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "target": "es2022",        "lib": ["es2022", "esnext.disposable", "dom"]    }}
```

## Decorator Metadata

TypeScript 5.2 implements an upcoming ECMAScript feature called decorator metadata .

The key idea of this feature is to make it easy for decorators to create and consume metadata on any class they’re used on or within.

Whenever decorator functions are used, they now have access to a new `metadata` property on their context object.
The `metadata` property just holds a simple object.
Since JavaScript lets us add properties arbitrarily, it can be used as a dictionary that is updated by each decorator.
Alternatively, since every `metadata` object will be identical for each decorated portion of a class, it can be used as a key into a `Map`.
After all decorators on or in a class get run, that object can be accessed on the class via `Symbol.metadata`.



```id
tsinterface Context {    name: string;    metadata: Record<PropertyKey, unknown>;}function setMetadata(_target: any, context: Context) {    context.metadata[context.name] = true;}class SomeClass {    @setMetadata    foo = 123;    @setMetadata    accessor bar = "hello!";    @setMetadata    baz() { }}const ourMetadata = SomeClass[Symbol.metadata];console.log(JSON.stringify(ourMetadata));// { "bar": true, "baz": true, "foo": true }
```



This can be useful in a number of different scenarios.
Metadata could possibly be attached for lots of uses like debugging, serialization, or performing dependency injection with decorators.
Since metadata objects are created per decorated class, frameworks can either privately use them as keys into a `Map` or `WeakMap`, or tack properties on as necessary.

For example, let’s say we wanted to use decorators to keep track of which properties and accessors are serializable when using `JSON.stringify` like so:



```id
tsimport { serialize, jsonify } from "./serializer";class Person {    firstName: string;    lastName: string;    @serialize    age: number    @serialize    get fullName() {        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;    }    toJSON() {        return jsonify(this)    }    constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string, age: number) {        // ...    }}
```



Here, the intent is that only `age` and `fullName` should be serialized because they are marked with the `@serialize` decorator.
We define a `toJSON` method for this purpose, but it just calls out to `jsonify` which uses the metadata that `@serialize` created.

Here’s an example of how the module `./serialize.ts` might be defined:



```id
tsconst serializables = Symbol();type Context =    | ClassAccessorDecoratorContext    | ClassGetterDecoratorContext    | ClassFieldDecoratorContext    ;export function serialize(_target: any, context: Context): void {    if (context.static || context.private) {        throw new Error("Can only serialize public instance members.")    }    if (typeof context.name === "symbol") {        throw new Error("Cannot serialize symbol-named properties.");    }    const propNames =        (context.metadata[serializables] as string[] | undefined) ??= [];    propNames.push(context.name);}export function jsonify(instance: object): string {    const metadata = instance.constructor[Symbol.metadata];    const propNames = metadata?.[serializables] as string[] | undefined;    if (!propNames) {        throw new Error("No members marked with @serialize.");    }    const pairStrings = propNames.map(key => {        const strKey = JSON.stringify(key);        const strValue = JSON.stringify((instance as any)[key]);        return `${strKey}: ${strValue}`;    });    return `{ ${pairStrings.join(", ")} }`;}
```



This module has a local `symbol` called `serializables` to store and retrieve the names of properties marked `@serializable`.
It stores a list of these property names on the metadata on each invocation of `@serializable`.
When `jsonify` is called, the list of properties is fetched off of the metadata and used to retrieve the actual values from the instance, eventually serializing those names and values.

Using a `symbol` technically makes this data accessible to others.
An alternative might be to use a `WeakMap` using the metadata object as a key.
This keeps data private and happens to use fewer type assertions in this case, but is otherwise similar.



```id
tsconst serializables = new WeakMap<object, string[]>();type Context =    | ClassAccessorDecoratorContext    | ClassGetterDecoratorContext    | ClassFieldDecoratorContext    ;export function serialize(_target: any, context: Context): void {    if (context.static || context.private) {        throw new Error("Can only serialize public instance members.")    }    if (typeof context.name !== "string") {        throw new Error("Can only serialize string properties.");    }    let propNames = serializables.get(context.metadata);    if (propNames === undefined) {        serializables.set(context.metadata, propNames = []);    }    propNames.push(context.name);}export function jsonify(instance: object): string {    const metadata = instance.constructor[Symbol.metadata];    const propNames = metadata && serializables.get(metadata);    if (!propNames) {        throw new Error("No members marked with @serialize.");    }    const pairStrings = propNames.map(key => {        const strKey = JSON.stringify(key);        const strValue = JSON.stringify((instance as any)[key]);        return `${strKey}: ${strValue}`;    });    return `{ ${pairStrings.join(", ")} }`;}
```



As a note, these implementations don’t handle subclassing and inheritance.
That’s left as an exercise to you (and you might find that it is easier in one version of the file than the other!).

Because this feature is still fresh, most runtimes will not support it natively.
To use it, you will need a polyfill for `Symbol.metadata`.
Something as simple as the following should work for most cases:



```id
tsSymbol.metadata ??= Symbol("Symbol.metadata");
```



You will also need to set your compilation `target` to `es2022` or below, and configure your `lib` setting to either include `"esnext"` or `"esnext.decorators"`.



```id
json{    "compilerOptions": {        "target": "es2022",        "lib": ["es2022", "esnext.decorators", "dom"]    }}
```



We’d like to thank Oleksandr Tarasiuk for contributing the implementation of decorator metadata for TypeScript 5.2!

 

## Named and Anonymous Tuple Elements

Tuple types have supported optional labels or names for each element.



```id
tstype Pair<T> = [first: T, second: T];
```



These labels don’t change what you’re allowed to do with them — they’re solely to help with readability and tooling.

However, TypeScript previously had a rule that tuples could not mix and match between labeled and unlabeled elements.
In other words, either no element could have a label in a tuple, or all elements needed one.



```id
ts// ✅ fine - no labelstype Pair1<T> = [T, T];// ✅ fine - all fully labeledtype Pair2<T> = [first: T, second: T];// ❌ previously an errortype Pair3<T> = [first: T, T];//                         ~// Tuple members must all have names// or all not have names.
```



This could be annoying for rest elements where we’d be forced to just add a label like `rest` or `tail`.



```id
ts// ❌ previously an errortype TwoOrMore_A<T> = [first: T, second: T, ...T[]];//                                          ~~~~~~// Tuple members must all have names// or all not have names.// ✅type TwoOrMore_B<T> = [first: T, second: T, rest: ...T[]];
```



It also meant that this restriction had to be enforced internally in the type system, meaning TypeScript would lose labels.



```id
tstype HasLabels = [a: string, b: string];type HasNoLabels = [number, number];type Merged = [...HasNoLabels, ...HasLabels];//   ^ [number, number, string, string]////     'a' and 'b' were lost in 'Merged'
```



In TypeScript 5.2, the all-or-nothing restriction on tuple labels has been lifted.
The language can now also preserve labels when spreading into an unlabeled tuple.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Josh Goldberg and Mateusz Burzyński who collaborated to lift this restriction .

## Easier Method Usage for Unions of Arrays

In previous versions of TypeScript, calling a method on a union of arrays could end in pain.



```id
tsdeclare let array: string[] | number[];array.filter(x => !!x);//    ~~~~~~ error!// This expression is not callable.//   Each member of the union type '...' has signatures,//   but none of those signatures are compatible//   with each other.
```



In this example, TypeScript would try to see if each version of `filter` is compatible across `string[]` and `number[]`.
Without a coherent strategy, TypeScript threw its hands in the air and said “I can’t make it work”.

In TypeScript 5.2, before giving up in these cases, unions of arrays are treated as a special case.
A new array type is constructed out of each member’s element type, and then the method is invoked on that.

Taking the above example, `string[] | number[]` is transformed into `(string | number)[]` (or `Array `), and `filter` is invoked on that type.
There is a slight caveat which is that `filter` will produce an `Array ` instead of a `string[] | number[]`;
but for a freshly produced value there is less risk of something “going wrong”.

This means lots of methods like `filter`, `find`, `some`, `every`, and `reduce` should all be invokable on unions of arrays in cases where they were not previously.

You can read up more details on the implementing pull request .

## Type-Only Import Paths with TypeScript Implementation File Extensions

TypeScript now allows both declaration and implementation file extensions to be included in type-only import paths, regardless of whether `allowImportingTsExtensions` is enabled.

This means that you can now write `import type` statements that use `.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`, and `.tsx` file extensions.



```id
tsimport type { JustAType } from "./justTypes.ts";export function f(param: JustAType) {    // ...}
```



It also means that `import()` types, which can be used in both TypeScript and JavaScript with JSDoc, can use those file extensions.



```id
js/** * @param {import("./justTypes.ts").JustAType} param */export function f(param) {    // ...}
```



For more information, see the change here .

## Comma Completions for Object Members

It can be easy to forget to add a comma when adding a new property to an object.
Previously, if you forgot a comma and requested auto-completion, TypeScript would confusingly give poor unrelated completion results.

TypeScript 5.2 now gracefully provides object member completions when you’re missing a comma.
But to just skip past hitting you with a syntax error, it will also auto-insert the missing comma.

 

For more information, see the implementation here .

## Inline Variable Refactoring

TypeScript 5.2 now has a refactoring to inline the contents of a variable to all usage sites.

 .

Using the “inline variable” refactoring will eliminate the variable and replace all the variable’s usages with its initializer.
Note that this may cause that initializer’s side-effects to run at a different time, and as many times as the variable has been used.

For more details, see the implementing pull request .

 

## Optimized Checks for Ongoing Type Compatibility

Because TypeScript is a structural type system, types occasionally need to be compared in a member-wise fashion;
however, recursive types add some issues here.
For example:



```id
tsinterface A {    value: A;    other: string;}interface B {    value: B;    other: number;}
```



When checking whether the type `A` is compatible with the type `B`, TypeScript will end up checking whether the types of `value` in `A` and `B` are respectively compatible.
At this point, the type system needs to stop checking any further and proceed to check other members.
To do this, the type system has to track when any two types are already being related.

Previously TypeScript already kept a stack of type pairs, and iterated through that to determine whether those types are being related.
When this stack is shallow that’s not a problem; but when the stack isn’t shallow, that, uh, is a problem .

In TypeScript 5.3, a simple `Set` helps track this information.
This reduced the time spent on a reported test case that used the drizzle library by over 33%!



```
Benchmark 1: old  Time (mean ± σ):      3.115 s ±  0.067 s    [User: 4.403 s, System: 0.124 s]  Range (min … max):    3.018 s …  3.196 s    10 runs Benchmark 2: new  Time (mean ± σ):      2.072 s ±  0.050 s    [User: 3.355 s, System: 0.135 s]  Range (min … max):    1.985 s …  2.150 s    10 runs Summary  'new' ran    1.50 ± 0.05 times faster than 'old'
```

## Breaking Changes and Correctness Fixes

TypeScript strives not to unnecessarily introduce breaks;
however, occasionally we must make corrections and improvements so that code can be better-analyzed.

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Types generated for the DOM may have an impact on your codebase.
For more information, see the DOM updates for TypeScript 5.2 .

### `labeledElementDeclarations` May Hold `undefined` Elements

In order to support a mixture of labeled and unlabeled elements , TypeScript’s API has changed slightly.
The `labeledElementDeclarations` property of `TupleType` may hold `undefined` for at each position where an element is unlabeled.



```id
diff  interface TupleType {-     labeledElementDeclarations?: readonly (NamedTupleMember | ParameterDeclaration)[];+     labeledElementDeclarations?: readonly (NamedTupleMember | ParameterDeclaration | undefined)[];  }
```



### `module` and `moduleResolution` Must Match Under Recent Node.js settings

The `--module` and `--moduleResolution` options each support a `node16` and `nodenext` setting.
These are effectively “modern Node.js” settings that should be used on any recent Node.js project.
What we’ve found is that when these two options don’t agree on whether they are using Node.js-related settings, projects are effectively misconfigured.

In TypeScript 5.2, when using `node16` or `nodenext` for either of the `--module` and `--moduleResolution` options, TypeScript now requires the other to have a similar Node.js-related setting.
In cases where the settings diverge, you’ll likely get an error message like either



```
Option 'moduleResolution' must be set to 'NodeNext' (or left unspecified) when option 'module' is set to 'NodeNext'.
```



or



```
Option 'module' must be set to 'Node16' when option 'moduleResolution' is set to 'Node16'.
```



So for example `--module esnext --moduleResolution node16` will be rejected — but you may be better off just using `--module nodenext` alone, or `--module esnext --moduleResolution bundler`.

For more information, see the change here .

### Consistent Export Checking for Merged Symbols

When two declarations merge, they must agree on whether they are both exported.
Due to a bug, TypeScript missed specific cases in ambient contexts, like in declaration files or `declare module` blocks.
For example, it would not issue an error on a case like the following, where `replaceInFile` is declared once as an exported function, and one as an un-exported namespace.



```id
tsdeclare module 'replace-in-file' {    export function replaceInFile(config: unknown): Promise<unknown[]>;    export {};    namespace replaceInFile {        export function sync(config: unknown): unknown[];  }}
```



In an ambient module, adding an `export { ... }` or a similar construct like `export default ...` implicitly changes whether all declarations are automatically exported.
TypeScript now recognizes these unfortunately confusing semantics more consistently, and issues an error on the fact that all declarations of `replaceInFile` need to agree in their modifiers, and will issue the following error:



```
Individual declarations in merged declaration 'replaceInFile' must be all exported or all local.
```



For more information, see the change here .

# TypeScript 4.4

 

## Control Flow Analysis of Aliased Conditions and Discriminants

In JavaScript, we often have to probe a value in different ways, and do something different once we know more about its type.
TypeScript understands these checks and calls them type guards .
Instead of having to convince TypeScript of a variable’s type whenever we use it, the type-checker leverages something called control flow analysis to see if we’ve used a type guard before a given piece of code.

For example, we can write something like



```id
tsfunction foo(arg: unknown) {  if (typeof arg === "string") {    console.log(arg.toUpperCase());                (parameter) arg: string  }}Try
```



In this example, we checked whether `arg` was a `string`.
TypeScript recognized the `typeof arg === "string"` check, which it considered a type guard, and knew that `arg` was a `string` inside the body of the `if` block.
That let us access `string` methods like `toUpperCase()` without getting an error.

However, what would happen if we moved the condition out to a constant called `argIsString`?



```id
ts// In TS 4.3 and belowfunction foo(arg: unknown) {  const argIsString = typeof arg === "string";  if (argIsString) {    console.log(arg.toUpperCase());    //              ~~~~~~~~~~~    // Error! Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'unknown'.  }}
```



In previous versions of TypeScript, this would be an error - even though `argIsString` was assigned the value of a type guard, TypeScript simply lost that information.
That’s unfortunate since we might want to re-use the same check in several places.
To get around that, users often have to repeat themselves or use type assertions (a.k.a. casts).

In TypeScript 4.4, that is no longer the case.
The above example works with no errors!
When TypeScript sees that we are testing a constant value, it will do a little bit of extra work to see if it contains a type guard.
If that type guard operates on a `const`, a `readonly` property, or an un-modified parameter, then TypeScript is able to narrow that value appropriately.

Different sorts of type guard conditions are preserved - not just `typeof` checks.
For example, checks on discriminated unions work like a charm.



```id
tstype Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; sideLength: number }; function area(shape: Shape): number {  const isCircle = shape.kind === "circle";  if (isCircle) {    // We know we have a circle here!    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;  } else {    // We know we&apos;re left with a square here!    return shape.sideLength ** 2;  }}Try
```



Analysis on discriminants in 4.4 also goes a little bit deeper - we can now extract out discriminants and TypeScript can narrow the original object.



```id
tstype Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; sideLength: number }; function area(shape: Shape): number {  // Extract out the &apos;kind&apos; field first.  const { kind } = shape;   if (kind === "circle") {    // We know we have a circle here!    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;  } else {    // We know we&apos;re left with a square here!    return shape.sideLength ** 2;  }}Try
```



As another example, here’s a function that checks whether two of its inputs have contents.



```id
tsfunction doSomeChecks(  inputA: string | undefined,  inputB: string | undefined,  shouldDoExtraWork: boolean) {  const mustDoWork = inputA && inputB && shouldDoExtraWork;  if (mustDoWork) {    // We can access &apos;string&apos; properties on both &apos;inputA&apos; and &apos;inputB&apos;!    const upperA = inputA.toUpperCase();    const upperB = inputB.toUpperCase();    // ...  }}Try
```



TypeScript can understand that both `inputA` and `inputB` are both present if `mustDoWork` is `true`.
That means we don’t have to write a non-null assertion like `inputA!` to convince TypeScript that `inputA` isn’t `undefined`.

One neat feature here is that this analysis works transitively.
TypeScript will hop through constants to understand what sorts of checks you’ve already performed.

 


```id
tsfunction f(x: string | number | boolean) {  const isString = typeof x === "string";  const isNumber = typeof x === "number";  const isStringOrNumber = isString || isNumber;  if (isStringOrNumber) {    x;   (parameter) x: string | number  } else {    x;   (parameter) x: boolean  }}Try
```



Note that there’s a cutoff - TypeScript doesn’t go arbitrarily deep when checking these conditions, but its analysis is deep enough for most checks.

This feature should make a lot of intuitive JavaScript code “just work” in TypeScript without it getting in your way.
For more details, check out the implementation on GitHub !

## Symbol and Template String Pattern Index Signatures

TypeScript lets us describe objects where every property has to have a certain type using index signatures .
This allows us to use these objects as dictionary-like types, where we can use string keys to index into them with square brackets.

For example, we can write a type with an index signature that takes `string` keys and maps to `boolean` values.
If we try to assign anything other than a `boolean` value, we’ll get an error.



```id
tsinterface BooleanDictionary {  [key: string]: boolean;} declare let myDict: BooleanDictionary; // Valid to assign boolean valuesmyDict["foo"] = true;myDict["bar"] = false; // Error, "oops" isn&apos;t a booleanmyDict["baz"] = "oops";Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.Try
```



While a `Map` might be a better data structure here (specifically, a `Map `), JavaScript objects are often more convenient to use or just happen to be what we’re given to work with.

Similarly, `Array ` already defines a `number` index signature that lets us insert/retrieve values of type `T`.



```id
ts// @errors: 2322 2375// This is part of TypeScript's definition of the built-in Array type.interface Array<T> {  [index: number]: T;  // ...}let arr = new Array<string>();// Validarr[0] = "hello!";// Error, expecting a 'string' value herearr[1] = 123;
```



Index signatures are very useful to express lots of code out in the wild;
however, until now they’ve been limited to `string` and `number` keys (and `string` index signatures have an intentional quirk where they can accept `number` keys since they’ll be coerced to strings anyway).
That means that TypeScript didn’t allow indexing objects with `symbol` keys.
TypeScript also couldn’t model an index signature of some subset of `string` keys - for example, an index signature which describes just properties whose names start with the text `data-`.

TypeScript 4.4 addresses these limitations, and allows index signatures for `symbol`s and template string patterns.

For example, TypeScript now allows us to declare a type that can be keyed on arbitrary `symbol`s.



```id
tsinterface Colors {  [sym: symbol]: number;} const red =  symbol' >Symbol("red");const green =  symbol' >Symbol("green");const blue =  symbol' >Symbol("blue"); let colors: Colors = {}; // Assignment of a number is allowedcolors[red] = 255;let redVal = colors[red];      let redVal: number colors[blue] = "da ba dee";Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.Try
```



Similarly, we can write an index signature with template string pattern type.
One use of this might be to exempt properties starting with `data-` from TypeScript’s excess property checking.
When we pass an object literal to something with an expected type, TypeScript will look for excess properties that weren’t declared in the expected type.



```id
ts// @errors: 2322 2375interface Options {    width?: number;    height?: number;}let a: Options = {    width: 100,    height: 100,    "data-blah": true,};interface OptionsWithDataProps extends Options {    // Permit any property starting with 'data-'.    [optName: `data-${string}`]: unknown;}let b: OptionsWithDataProps = {    width: 100,    height: 100,    "data-blah": true,    // Fails for a property which is not known, nor    // starts with 'data-'    "unknown-property": true,};
```



A final note on index signatures is that they now permit union types, as long as they’re a union of infinite-domain primitive types - specifically:

 `string`

- `number`

- `symbol`

- template string patterns (e.g. ``hello-${string}``)

An index signature whose argument is a union of these types will de-sugar into several different index signatures.



```id
tsinterface Data {  [optName: string | symbol]: any;}// Equivalent tointerface Data {  [optName: string]: any;  [optName: symbol]: any;}
```

## Defaulting to the `unknown` Type in Catch Variables (`--useUnknownInCatchVariables`)

In JavaScript, any type of value can be thrown with `throw` and caught in a `catch` clause.
Because of this, TypeScript historically typed catch clause variables as `any`, and would not allow any other type annotation:



```id
tstry {  // Who knows what this might throw...  executeSomeThirdPartyCode();} catch (err) {  // err: any  console.error(err.message); // Allowed, because 'any'  err.thisWillProbablyFail(); // Allowed, because 'any' :(}
```



Once TypeScript added the `unknown` type, it became clear that `unknown` was a better choice than `any` in `catch` clause variables for users who want the highest degree of correctness and type-safety, since it narrows better and forces us to test against arbitrary values.
Eventually TypeScript 4.0 allowed users to specify an explicit type annotation of `unknown` (or `any`) on each `catch` clause variable so that we could opt into stricter types on a case-by-case basis;
however, for some, manually specifying `: unknown` on every `catch` clause was a chore.

That’s why TypeScript 4.4 introduces a new flag called `useUnknownInCatchVariables` .
This flag changes the default type of `catch` clause variables from `any` to `unknown`.



```id
tstry {  executeSomeThirdPartyCode();} catch (err) {  // err: unknown   // Error! Property &apos;message&apos; does not exist on type &apos;unknown&apos;.  console.error(err.message);'err' is of type 'unknown'.18046'err' is of type 'unknown'.   // Works! We can narrow &apos;err&apos; from &apos;unknown&apos; to &apos;Error&apos;.  if (err instanceof Error) {    console.error(err.message);  }}Try
```



This flag is enabled under the `strict` family of options.
That means that if you check your code using `strict` , this option will automatically be turned on.
You may end up with errors in TypeScript 4.4 such as



```
Property 'message' does not exist on type 'unknown'.Property 'name' does not exist on type 'unknown'.Property 'stack' does not exist on type 'unknown'.
```



In cases where we don’t want to deal with an `unknown` variable in a `catch` clause, we can always add an explicit `: any` annotation so that we can opt out of stricter types.

 


```id
tstry {  executeSomeThirdPartyCode();} catch (err: any) {  console.error(err.message); // Works again!}Try
```



For more information, take a look at the implementing pull request .

## Exact Optional Property Types (`--exactOptionalPropertyTypes`)

In JavaScript, reading a missing property on an object produces the value `undefined`.
It’s also possible to have an actual property with the value `undefined`.
A lot of code in JavaScript tends to treat these situations the same way, and so initially TypeScript just interpreted every optional property as if a user had written `undefined` in the type.
For example,



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age?: number;}
```



was considered equivalent to



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age?: number | undefined;}
```



What this meant is that a user could explicitly write `undefined` in place of `age`.



```id
tsconst p: Person = {  name: "Daniel",  age: undefined, // This is okay by default.};
```



So by default, TypeScript doesn’t distinguish between a present property with the value `undefined` and a missing property.
While this works most of the time, not all code in JavaScript makes the same assumptions.
Functions and operators like `Object.assign`, `Object.keys`, object spread (`{ ...obj }`), and `for`-`in` loops behave differently depending on whether or not a property actually exists on an object.
In the case of our `Person` example, this could potentially lead to runtime errors if the `age` property was observed in a context where its presence was important.

In TypeScript 4.4, the new flag `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` specifies that optional property types should be interpreted exactly as written, meaning that `| undefined` is not added to the type:



```id
ts// With &apos;exactOptionalPropertyTypes&apos; on:const p: Person = {Type '{ name: string; age: undefined; }' is not assignable to type 'Person' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'. Consider adding 'undefined' to the types of the target's properties.
  Types of property 'age' are incompatible.
    Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.2375Type '{ name: string; age: undefined; }' is not assignable to type 'Person' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'. Consider adding 'undefined' to the types of the target's properties.
  Types of property 'age' are incompatible.
    Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.  name: "Daniel",  age: undefined, // Error! undefined isn&apos;t a number};Try
```



This flag is not part of the `strict` family and needs to be turned on explicitly if you’d like this behavior.
It also requires `strictNullChecks` to be enabled as well.
We’ve been making updates to DefinitelyTyped and other definitions to try to make the transition as straightforward as possible, but you may encounter some friction with this depending on how your code is structured.

For more information, you can take a look at the implementing pull request here .

## `static` Blocks in Classes

TypeScript 4.4 brings support for `static` blocks in classes , an upcoming ECMAScript feature that can help you write more-complex initialization code for static members.



```id
tsclass Foo {    static count = 0;     // This is a static block:    static {        if (someCondition()) {            Foo.count++;        }    }}Try
```



These static blocks allow you to write a sequence of statements with their own scope that can access private fields within the containing class.
That means that we can write initialization code with all the capabilities of writing statements, no leakage of variables, and full access to our class’s internals.



```id
tsclass Foo {    static #count = 0;     get count() {        return Foo.#count;    }     static {        try {            const lastInstances = loadLastInstances();            Foo.#count += lastInstances..length: number' >length;        }        catch {}    }}Try
```



Without `static` blocks, writing the code above was possible, but often involved several different types of hacks that had to compromise in some way.

Note that a class can have multiple `static` blocks, and they’re run in the same order in which they’re written.



```id
ts// Prints://    1//    2//    3class Foo {    static prop = 1    static {        console.log(Foo.prop++);    }    static {        console.log(Foo.prop++);    }    static {        console.log(Foo.prop++);    }}Try
```



We’d like to extend our thanks to Wenlu Wang for TypeScript’s implementation of this feature.
For more details, you can see that pull request here .

## `tsc --help` Updates and Improvements

TypeScript’s `--help` option has gotten a refresh!
Thanks to work in part by Song Gao , we’ve brought in changes to update the descriptions of our compiler options and restyle the `--help` menu with colors and other visual separation.

 

You can read more on the original proposal thread .

## Performance Improvements

### Faster Declaration Emit

TypeScript now caches whether internal symbols are accessible in different contexts, along with how specific types should be printed.
These changes can improve TypeScript’s general performance in code with fairly complex types, and is especially observed when emitting `.d.ts` files under the `declaration` flag.

 See more details here .

### Faster Path Normalization

TypeScript often has to do several types of “normalization” on file paths to get them into a consistent format that the compiler can use everywhere.
This involves things like replacing backslashes with slashes, or removing intermediate `/./` and `/../` segments of paths.
When TypeScript has to operate over millions of these paths, these operations end up being a bit slow.
In TypeScript 4.4, paths first undergo quick checks to see whether they need any normalization in the first place.
These improvements together reduce project load time by 5-10% on bigger projects, and significantly more in massive projects that we’ve tested internally.

For more details, you can view the PR for path segment normalization along with the PR for slash normalization .

### Faster Path Mapping

TypeScript now caches the way it constructs path-mappings (using the `paths` option in `tsconfig.json`).
For projects with several hundred mappings, the reduction is significant.
You can see more on the change itself .

### Faster Incremental Builds with `--strict`

In what was effectively a bug, TypeScript would end up redoing type-checking work under `incremental` compilations if `strict` was on.
This led to many builds being just as slow as if `incremental` was turned off.
TypeScript 4.4 fixes this, though the change has also been back-ported to TypeScript 4.3.

See more here .

### Faster Source Map Generation for Big Outputs

TypeScript 4.4 adds an optimization for source map generation on extremely large output files.
When building an older version of the TypeScript compiler, this results in around an 8% reduction in emit time.

We’d like to extend our thanks to David Michon who provided a simple and clean change to enable this performance win.

### Faster `--force` Builds

When using `--build` mode on project references, TypeScript has to perform up-to-date checks to determine which files need to be rebuilt.
When performing a `--force` build, however, that information is irrelevant since every project dependency will be rebuilt from scratch.
In TypeScript 4.4, `--force` builds avoid those unnecessary steps and start a full build.
See more about the change here .

## Spelling Suggestions for JavaScript

TypeScript powers the JavaScript editing experience in editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
Most of the time, TypeScript tries to stay out of the way in JavaScript files;
however, TypeScript often has a lot of information to make confident suggestions, and ways of surfacing suggestions that aren’t too invasive.

That’s why TypeScript now issues spelling suggestions in plain JavaScript files - ones without `// @ts-check` or in a project with `checkJs` turned off.
These are the same “Did you mean…?” suggestions that TypeScript files already have, and now they’re available in all JavaScript files in some form.

These spelling suggestions can provide a subtle clue that your code is wrong.
We managed to find a few bugs in existing code while testing this feature!

For more details on this new feature, take a look at the pull request !

## Inlay Hints

TypeScript 4.4 provides support for inlay hints which can help display useful information like parameter names and return types in your code.
You can think of it as a sort of friendly “ghost text”.

 

This feature was built by Wenlu Wang whose pull request has more details.

Wenlu also contributed the integration for inlay hints in Visual Studio Code which has shipped as part of the July 2021 (1.59) release .
If you’d like to try inlay hints out, make sure you’re using a recent stable or insiders version of the editor.
You can also modify when and where inlay hints get displayed in Visual Studio Code’s settings.

## Auto-Imports Show True Paths in Completion Lists

When editors like Visual Studio Code show a completion list, completions which include auto-imports are displayed with a path to the given module;
however, this path usually isn’t what TypeScript ends up placing in a module specifier.
The path is usually something relative to the workspace , meaning that if you’re importing from a package like `moment`, you’ll often see a path like `node_modules/moment`.

 

These paths end up being unwieldy and often misleading, especially given that the path that actually gets inserted into your file needs to consider Node’s `node_modules` resolution, path mappings, symlinks, and re-exports.

That’s why with TypeScript 4.4, the completion item label now shows the actual module path that will be used for the import!

 

Since this calculation can be expensive, completion lists containing many auto-imports may fill in the final module specifiers in batches as you type more characters. It’s possible that you’ll still sometimes see the old workspace-relative path labels; however, as your editing experience “warms up”, they should get replaced with the actual path after another keystroke or two.

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes for TypeScript 4.4

As with every TypeScript version, declarations for `lib.d.ts` (especially the declarations generated for web contexts), have changed.
You can consult our list of known `lib.dom.d.ts` changes to understand what is impacted.

### More-Compliant Indirect Calls for Imported Functions

In earlier versions of TypeScript, calling an import from CommonJS, AMD, and other non-ES module systems would set the `this` value of the called function.
Specifically, in the following example, when calling `fooModule.foo()`, the `foo()` method will have `fooModule` set as the value of `this`.



```id
ts// Imagine this is our imported module, and it has an export named 'foo'.let fooModule = {  foo() {    console.log(this);  },};fooModule.foo();
```



This is not the way exported functions in ECMAScript are supposed to work when we call them.
That’s why TypeScript 4.4 intentionally discards the `this` value when calling imported functions, by using the following emit.



```id
ts// Imagine this is our imported module, and it has an export named 'foo'.let fooModule = {  foo() {    console.log(this);  },};// Notice we're actually calling '(0, fooModule.foo)' now, which is subtly different.(0, fooModule.foo)();
```



You can read up more about the changes here .

### Using `unknown` in Catch Variables

Users running with the `strict` flag may see new errors around `catch` variables being `unknown`, especially if the existing code assumes only `Error` values have been caught.
This often results in error messages such as:



```
Property 'message' does not exist on type 'unknown'.Property 'name' does not exist on type 'unknown'.Property 'stack' does not exist on type 'unknown'.
```



To get around this, you can specifically add runtime checks to ensure that the thrown type matches your expected type.
Otherwise, you can just use a type assertion, add an explicit `: any` to your catch variable, or turn off `useUnknownInCatchVariables` .

### Broader Always-Truthy Promise Checks

In prior versions, TypeScript introduced “Always Truthy Promise checks” to catch code where an `await` may have been forgotten;
however, the checks only applied to named declarations.
That meant that while this code would correctly receive an error…



```id
tsasync function foo(): Promise<boolean> {  return false;}async function bar(): Promise<string> {  const fooResult = foo();  if (fooResult) {    // <- error! :D    return "true";  }  return "false";}
```



…the following code would not.



```id
tsasync function foo(): Promise<boolean> {  return false;}async function bar(): Promise<string> {  if (foo()) {    // <- no error :(    return "true";  }  return "false";}
```



TypeScript 4.4 now flags both.
For more information, read up on the original change .

### Abstract Properties Do Not Allow Initializers

The following code is now an error because abstract properties may not have initializers:



```id
tsabstract class C {  abstract prop = 1;  //       ~~~~  // Property 'prop' cannot have an initializer because it is marked abstract.}
```



Instead, you may only specify a type for the property:



```id
tsabstract class C {  abstract prop: number;}
```

## Easier Implicit Returns for `undefined`-Returning Functions

In JavaScript, if a function finishes running without hitting a `return`, it returns the value `undefined`.



```id
tsfunction foo() {    // no return}// x = undefinedlet x = foo();
```



However, in previous versions of TypeScript, the only functions that could have absolutely no return statements were `void`- and `any`-returning functions.
That meant that even if you explicitly said “this function returns `undefined`” you were forced to have at least one return statement.



```id
ts// ✅ fine - we inferred that 'f1' returns 'void'function f1() {    // no returns}// ✅ fine - 'void' doesn't need a return statementfunction f2(): void {    // no returns}// ✅ fine - 'any' doesn't need a return statementfunction f3(): any {    // no returns}// ❌ error!// A function whose declared type is neither 'void' nor 'any' must return a value.function f4(): undefined {    // no returns}
```



This could be a pain if some API expected a function returning `undefined` - you would need to have either at least one explicit return of `undefined` or a `return` statement and an explicit annotation.



```id
tsdeclare function takesFunction(f: () => undefined): undefined;// ❌ error!// Argument of type '() => void' is not assignable to parameter of type '() => undefined'.takesFunction(() => {    // no returns});// ❌ error!// A function whose declared type is neither 'void' nor 'any' must return a value.takesFunction((): undefined => {    // no returns});// ❌ error!// Argument of type '() => void' is not assignable to parameter of type '() => undefined'.takesFunction(() => {    return;});// ✅ workstakesFunction(() => {    return undefined;});// ✅ workstakesFunction((): undefined => {    return;});
```



This behavior was frustrating and confusing, especially when calling functions outside of one’s control.
Understanding the interplay between inferring `void` over `undefined`, whether an `undefined`-returning function needs a `return` statement, etc. seems like a distraction.

First, TypeScript 5.1 now allows `undefined`-returning functions to have no return statement.



```id
ts// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1!function f4(): undefined {    // no returns}// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1!takesFunction((): undefined => {    // no returns});
```



Second, if a function has no return expressions and is being passed to something expecting a function that returns `undefined`, TypeScript infers `undefined` for that function’s return type.



```id
ts// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1!takesFunction(function f() {    //                 ^ return type is undefined    // no returns});// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1!takesFunction(function f() {    //                 ^ return type is undefined    return;});
```



To address another similar pain-point, under TypeScript’s `--noImplicitReturns` option, functions returning only `undefined` now have a similar exception to `void`, in that not every single code path must end in an explicit `return`.



```id
ts// ✅ Works in TypeScript 5.1 under '--noImplicitReturns'!function f(): undefined {    if (Math.random()) {        // do some stuff...        return;    }}
```

## Unrelated Types for Getters and Setters

TypeScript 4.3 made it possible to say that a `get` and `set` accessor pair might specify two different types.



```id
tsinterface Serializer {    set value(v: string | number | boolean);    get value(): string;}declare let box: Serializer;// Allows writing a 'boolean'box.value = true;// Comes out as a 'string'console.log(box.value.toUpperCase());
```



Initially we required that the `get` type had to be a subtype of the `set` type.
This meant that writing



```id
tsbox.value = box.value;
```



would always be valid.

However, there are plenty of existing and proposed APIs that have completely unrelated types between their getters and setters.
For example, consider one of the most common examples - the `style` property in the DOM and `CSSStyleRule` API.
Every style rule has a `style` property that is a `CSSStyleDeclaration` ;
however, if you try to write to that property, it will only work correctly with a string!

TypeScript 5.1 now allows completely unrelated types for `get` and `set` accessor properties, provided that they have explicit type annotations.
And while this version of TypeScript does not yet change the types for these built-in interfaces, `CSSStyleRule` can now be defined in the following way:



```id
tsinterface CSSStyleRule {    // ...    /** Always reads as a `CSSStyleDeclaration` */    get style(): CSSStyleDeclaration;    /** Can only write a `string` here. */    set style(newValue: string);    // ...}
```



This also allows other patterns like requiring `set` accessors to accept only “valid” data, but specifying that `get` accessors may return `undefined` if some underlying state hasn’t been initialized yet.



```id
tsclass SafeBox {    #value: string | undefined;    // Only accepts strings!    set value(newValue: string) {    }    // Must check for 'undefined'!    get value(): string | undefined {        return this.#value;    }}
```



In fact, this is similar to how optional properties are checked under `--exactOptionalProperties`.

You can read up more on the implementing pull request .

## Decoupled Type-Checking Between JSX Elements and JSX Tag Types

One pain point TypeScript had with JSX was its requirements on the type of every JSX element’s tag.

For context, a JSX element is either of the following:



```id
tsx// A self-closing JSX tag<Foo />// A regular element with an opening/closing tag<Bar></Bar>
```



When type-checking ` ` or ` `, TypeScript always looks up a namespace called `JSX` and fetches a type out of it called `Element` - or more directly, it looks up `JSX.Element`.

But to check whether `Foo` or `Bar` themselves were valid to use as tag names, TypeScript would roughly just grab the types returned or constructed by `Foo` or `Bar` and check for compatibility with `JSX.Element` (or another type called `JSX.ElementClass` if the type is constructable).

The limitations here meant that components could not be used if they returned or “rendered” a more broad type than just `JSX.Element`.
For example, a JSX library might be fine with a component returning `string`s or `Promise`s.

As a more concrete example, React is considering adding limited support for components that return `Promise`s , but existing versions of TypeScript cannot express that without someone drastically loosening the type of `JSX.Element`.



```id
tsximport * as React from "react";async function Foo() {    return <div></div>;}let element = <Foo />;//             ~~~// 'Foo' cannot be used as a JSX component.//   Its return type 'Promise<Element>' is not a valid JSX element.
```



To provide libraries with a way to express this, TypeScript 5.1 now looks up a type called `JSX.ElementType`.
`ElementType` specifies precisely what is valid to use as a tag in a JSX element.
So it might be typed today as something like



```id
tsxnamespace JSX {    export type ElementType =        // All the valid lowercase tags        keyof IntrinsicAttributes        // Function components        (props: any) => Element        // Class components        new (props: any) => ElementClass;    export interface IntrinsicAttributes extends /*...*/ {}    export type Element = /*...*/;    export type ElementClass = /*...*/;}
```



We’d like to extend our thanks to Sebastian Silbermann who contributed this change !

## Namespaced JSX Attributes

TypeScript now supports namespaced attribute names when using JSX.



```id
tsximport * as React from "react";// Both of these are equivalent:const x = <Foo a:b="hello" />;const y = <Foo a : b="hello" />;interface FooProps {    "a:b": string;}function Foo(props: FooProps) {    return <div>{props["a:b"]}</div>;}
```



Namespaced tag names are looked up in a similar way on `JSX.IntrinsicAttributes` when the first segment of the name is a lowercase name.



```id
tsx// In some library's code or in an augmentation of that library:namespace JSX {    interface IntrinsicElements {        ["a:b"]: { prop: string };    }}// In our code:let x = <a:b prop="hello!" />;
```

## `typeRoots` Are Consulted In Module Resolution

When TypeScript’s specified module lookup strategy is unable to resolve a path, it will now resolve packages relative to the specified `typeRoots`.

See this pull request for more details.

## Move Declarations to Existing Files

In addition to moving declarations to new files, TypeScript now ships a preview feature for moving declarations to existing files as well.
You can try this functionality out in a recent version of Visual Studio Code.

 

Keep in mind that this feature is currently in preview, and we are seeking further feedback on it.

 https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/53542 

## Linked Cursors for JSX Tags

TypeScript now supports linked editing for JSX tag names.
Linked editing (occasionally called “mirrored cursors”) allows an editor to edit multiple locations at the same time automatically.

 

This new feature should work in both TypeScript and JavaScript files, and can be enabled in Visual Studio Code Insiders.
In Visual Studio Code, you can either edit the `Editor: Linked Editing` option in the Settings UI:

 

or configure `editor.linkedEditing` in your JSON settings file:



```id
jsonc{    // ...    "editor.linkedEditing": true,}
```



This feature will also be supported by Visual Studio 17.7 Preview 1.

You can take a look at our implementation of linked editing here!

## Snippet Completions for `@param` JSDoc Tags

TypeScript now provides snippet completions when typing out a `@param` tag in both TypeScript and JavaScript files.
This can help cut down on some typing and jumping around text as you document your code or add JSDoc types in JavaScript.

 

You can check out how this new feature was implemented on GitHub .

## Optimizations

### Avoiding Unnecessary Type Instantiation

TypeScript 5.1 now avoids performing type instantiation within object types that are known not to contain references to outer type parameters.
This has the potential to cut down on many unnecessary computations, and reduced the type-checking time of material-ui’s docs directory by over 50%.

You can see the changes involved for this change on GitHub .

### Negative Case Checks for Union Literals

When checking if a source type is part of a union type, TypeScript will first do a fast look-up using an internal type identifier for that source.
If that look-up fails, then TypeScript checks for compatibility against every type within the union.

When relating a literal type to a union of purely literal types, TypeScript can now avoid that full walk against every other type in the union.
This assumption is safe because TypeScript always interns/caches literal types - though there are some edge cases to handle relating to “fresh” literal types.

 This optimization was able to reduce the type-checking time of the code in this issue from about 45 seconds to about 0.4 seconds.

### Reduced Calls into Scanner for JSDoc Parsing

When older versions of TypeScript parsed out a JSDoc comment, they would use the scanner/tokenizer to break the comment into fine-grained tokens and piece the contents back together.
This could be helpful for normalizing comment text, so that multiple spaces would just collapse into one;
but it was extremely “chatty” and meant the parser and scanner would jump back and forth very often, adding overhead to JSDoc parsing.

TypeScript 5.1 has moved more logic around breaking down JSDoc comments into the scanner/tokenizer.
The scanner now returns larger chunks of content directly to the parser to do as it needs.

 These changes have brought down the parse time of several 10Mb mostly-prose-comment JavaScript files by about half.
For a more realistic example, our performance suite’s snapshot of xstate dropped about 300ms of parse time, making it faster to load and analyze.

## Breaking Changes

### ES2020 and Node.js 14.17 as Minimum Runtime Requirements

TypeScript 5.1 now ships JavaScript functionality that was introduced in ECMAScript 2020.
As a result, at minimum TypeScript must be run in a reasonably modern runtime.
For most users, this means TypeScript now only runs on Node.js 14.17 and later.

If you try running TypeScript 5.1 under an older version of Node.js such as Node 10 or 12, you may see an error like the following from running either `tsc.js` or `tsserver.js`:



```
node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.js:2406  for (let i = startIndex ?? 0; i < array.length; i++) {                           ^ SyntaxError: Unexpected token '?'    at wrapSafe (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:915:16)    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:963:27)    at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1027:10)    at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:863:32)    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:708:14)    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (internal/modules/run_main.js:60:12)    at internal/main/run_main_module.js:17:47
```



Additionally, if you try installing TypeScript you’ll get something like the following error messages from npm:



```
npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {npm WARN EBADENGINE   package: 'typescript@5.1.1-rc',npm WARN EBADENGINE   required: { node: '>=14.17' },npm WARN EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v12.22.12', npm: '8.19.2' }npm WARN EBADENGINE }
```



from Yarn:



```
error typescript@5.1.1-rc: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=14.17". Got "12.22.12"error Found incompatible module.
```


 

 See more information around this change here .

### Explicit `typeRoots` Disables Upward Walks for `node_modules/@types`

Previously, when the `typeRoots` option was specified in a `tsconfig.json` but resolution to any `typeRoots` directories had failed, TypeScript would still continue walking up parent directories, trying to resolve packages within each parent’s `node_modules/@types` folder.

This behavior could prompt excessive look-ups and has been disabled in TypeScript 5.1.
As a result, you may begin to see errors like the following based on entries in your `tsconfig.json`’s `types` option or `/// ` directives



```
error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'node'.error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'mocha'.error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'jasmine'.error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'chai-http'.error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'webpack-env"'.
```



The solution is typically to add specific entries for `node_modules/@types` to your `typeRoots`:



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "types": [            "node",            "mocha"        ],        "typeRoots": [            // Keep whatever you had around before.            "./some-custom-types/",            // You might need your local 'node_modules/@types'.            "./node_modules/@types",            // You might also need to specify a shared 'node_modules/@types'            // if you're using a "monorepo" layout.            "../../node_modules/@types",        ]    }}
```

# TypeScript 4.3

 

## Separate Write Types on Properties

In JavaScript, it’s pretty common for APIs to convert values that are passed in before storing them.
This often happens with getters and setters too.
For example, let’s imagine we’ve got a class with a setter that always converts a value into a `number` before saving it in a private field.



```id
jsclass Thing {  #size = 0;   get size() {    return this.#size;  }  set size(value) {    let num =  number' >Number(value);     // Don&apos;t allow NaN and stuff.    if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {      this.#size = 0;      return;    }     this.#size = num;  }}Try
```



How would we type this JavaScript code in TypeScript?
Well, technically we don’t have to do anything special here - TypeScript can look at this with no explicit types and can figure out that `size` is a number.

The problem is that `size` allows you to assign more than just `number`s to it.
We could get around this by saying that `size` has the type `unknown` or `any` like in this snippet:



```id
tsclass Thing {  // ...  get size(): unknown {    return this.#size;  }}
```



But that’s no good - `unknown` forces people reading `size` to do a type assertion, and `any` won’t catch any mistakes.
If we really want to model APIs that convert values, previous versions of TypeScript forced us to pick between being precise (which makes reading values easier, and writing harder) and being permissive (which makes writing values easier, and reading harder).

That’s why TypeScript 4.3 allows you to specify types for reading and writing to properties.



```id
tsclass Thing {  #size = 0;   get size(): number {    return this.#size;  }   set size(value: string | number | boolean) {    let num =  number' >Number(value);     // Don&apos;t allow NaN and stuff.    if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {      this.#size = 0;      return;    }     this.#size = num;  }}Try
```



In the above example, our `set` accessor takes a broader set of types (`string`s, `boolean`s, and `number`s), but our `get` accessor always guarantees it will be a `number`.
Now we can finally assign other types to these properties with no errors!



```id
tslet thing = new Thing(); // Assigning other types to `thing.size` works!thing.size = "hello";thing.size = true;thing.size = 42; // Reading `thing.size` always produces a number!let mySize: number = thing.size;Try
```



When considering how two properties with the same name relate to each other, TypeScript will only use the “reading” type (e.g. the type on the `get` accessor above).
“Writing” types are only considered when directly writing to a property.

Keep in mind, this isn’t a pattern that’s limited to classes.
You can write getters and setters with different types in object literals.



```id
tsfunction makeThing(): Thing {  let size = 0;  return {    get size(): number {      return size;    },    set size(value: string | number | boolean) {      let num = Number(value);      // Don't allow NaN and stuff.      if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {        size = 0;        return;      }      size = num;    },  };}
```



In fact, we’ve added syntax to interfaces/object types to support different reading/writing types on properties.



```id
ts// Now valid!interface Thing {    get size(): number    set size(value: number | string | boolean);}
```



One limitation of using different types for reading and writing properties is that the type for reading a property has to be assignable to the type that you’re writing.
In other words, the getter type has to be assignable to the setter.
This ensures some level of consistency, so that a property is always assignable to itself.

For more information on this feature, take a look at the implementing pull request .

## `override` and the `--noImplicitOverride` Flag

When extending classes in JavaScript, the language makes it super easy (pun intended) to override methods - but unfortunately, there are some mistakes that you can run into.

One big one is missing renames.
For example, take the following classes:



```id
tsclass SomeComponent {  show() {    // ...  }  hide() {    // ...  }}class SpecializedComponent extends SomeComponent {  show() {    // ...  }  hide() {    // ...  }}
```



`SpecializedComponent` subclasses `SomeComponent`, and overrides the `show` and `hide` methods.
What happens if someone decides to rip out `show` and `hide` and replace them with a single method?



```id
diff class SomeComponent {-    show() {-        // ...-    }-    hide() {-        // ...-    }+    setVisible(value: boolean) {+        // ...+    } } class SpecializedComponent extends SomeComponent {     show() {         // ...     }     hide() {         // ...     } }
```



 Oh no! 
Our `SpecializedComponent` didn’t get updated.
Now it’s just adding these two useless `show` and `hide` methods that probably won’t get called.

Part of the issue here is that a user can’t make it clear whether they meant to add a new method, or to override an existing one.
That’s why TypeScript 4.3 adds the `override` keyword.



```id
tsclass SpecializedComponent extends SomeComponent {    override show() {        // ...    }    override hide() {        // ...    }}
```



When a method is marked with `override`, TypeScript will always make sure that a method with the same name exists in a the base class.



```id
tsclass SomeComponent {    setVisible(value: boolean) {        // ...    }}class SpecializedComponent extends SomeComponent {    override show() {This member cannot have an 'override' modifier because it is not declared in the base class 'SomeComponent'.4113This member cannot have an 'override' modifier because it is not declared in the base class 'SomeComponent'.     }}Try
```



This is a big improvement, but it doesn’t help if you forget to write `override` on a method - and that’s a big mistake users can run into also.

For example, you might accidentally “trample over” a method that exists in a base class without realizing it.



```id
tsclass Base {  someHelperMethod() {    // ...  }}class Derived extends Base {  // Oops! We weren't trying to override here,  // we just needed to write a local helper method.  someHelperMethod() {    // ...  }}
```



That’s why TypeScript 4.3 also provides a new `noImplicitOverride` flag.
When this option is turned on, it becomes an error to override any method from a superclass unless you explicitly use an `override` keyword.
In that last example, TypeScript would error under `noImplicitOverride` , and give us a clue that we probably need to rename our method inside of `Derived`.

We’d like to extend our thanks to our community for the implementation here.
The work for these items was implemented in a pull request by Wenlu Wang , though an earlier pull request implementing only the `override` keyword by Paul Cody Johnston served as a basis for direction and discussion.
We extend our gratitude for putting in the time for these features.

## Template String Type Improvements

In recent versions, TypeScript introduced a new type construct: template string types.
These are types that either construct new string-like types by concatenating…



```id
tstype Color = "red" | "blue";type Quantity = "one" | "two";type SeussFish = `${Quantity | Color} fish`;// same as//   type SeussFish = "one fish" | "two fish"//                  | "red fish" | "blue fish";
```



…or match patterns of other string-like types.



```id
tsdeclare let s1: `${number}-${number}-${number}`;declare let s2: `1-2-3`;// Works!s1 = s2;
```



The first change we made is just in when TypeScript will infer a template string type.
When a template string is contextually typed by a string-literal-like type (i.e. when TypeScript sees we’re passing a template string to something that takes a literal type) it will try to give that expression a template type.



```id
tsfunction bar(s: string): `hello ${string}` {    // Previously an error, now works!    return `hello ${s}`;}
```



This also kicks in when inferring types, and the type parameter `extends string`



```id
tsdeclare let s: string;declare function f<T extends string>(x: T): T;// Previously: string// Now       : `hello ${string}`let x2 = f(`hello ${s}`);
```



The second major change here is that TypeScript can now better-relate, and infer between , different template string types.

To see this, take the following example code:



```id
tsdeclare let s1: `${number}-${number}-${number}`;declare let s2: `1-2-3`;declare let s3: `${number}-2-3`;s1 = s2;s1 = s3;
```



When checking against a string literal type like on `s2`, TypeScript could match against the string contents and figure out that `s2` was compatible with `s1` in the first assignment;
however, as soon as it saw another template string, it just gave up.
As a result, assignments like `s3` to `s1` just didn’t work.

TypeScript now actually does the work to prove whether or not each part of a template string can successfully match.
You can now mix and match template strings with different substitutions and TypeScript will do a good job to figure out whether they’re really compatible.



```id
tsdeclare let s1: `${number}-${number}-${number}`;declare let s2: `1-2-3`;declare let s3: `${number}-2-3`;declare let s4: `1-${number}-3`;declare let s5: `1-2-${number}`;declare let s6: `${number}-2-${number}`;// Now *all of these* work!s1 = s2;s1 = s3;s1 = s4;s1 = s5;s1 = s6;
```



In doing this work, we were also sure to add better inference capabilities.
You can see an example of these in action:



```id
tsdeclare function foo<V extends string>(arg: `*${V}*`): V;function test<T extends string>(s: string, n: number, b: boolean, t: T) {    let x1 = foo("*hello*");            // "hello"    let x2 = foo("**hello**");          // "*hello*"    let x3 = foo(`*${s}*` as const);    // string    let x4 = foo(`*${n}*` as const);    // `${number}`    let x5 = foo(`*${b}*` as const);    // "true" | "false"    let x6 = foo(`*${t}*` as const);    // `${T}`    let x7 = foo(`**${s}**` as const);  // `*${string}*`}
```



For more information, see the original pull request on leveraging contextual types , along with the pull request that improved inference and checking between template types .

## ECMAScript `#private` Class Elements

TypeScript 4.3 expands which elements in a class can be given `#private` `#names` to make them truly private at run-time.
In addition to properties, methods and accessors can also be given private names.



```id
tsclass Foo {  #someMethod() {    //...  }  get #someValue() {    return 100;  }  publicMethod() {    // These work.    // We can access private-named members inside this class.    this.#someMethod();    return this.#someValue;  }}new Foo().#someMethod();//        ~~~~~~~~~~~// error!// Property '#someMethod' is not accessible// outside class 'Foo' because it has a private identifier.new Foo().#someValue;//        ~~~~~~~~~~// error!// Property '#someValue' is not accessible// outside class 'Foo' because it has a private identifier.
```



Even more broadly, static members can now also have private names.



```id
tsclass Foo {  static #someMethod() {    // ...  }}Foo.#someMethod();//  ~~~~~~~~~~~// error!// Property '#someMethod' is not accessible// outside class 'Foo' because it has a private identifier.
```



This feature was authored in a pull request from our friends at Bloomberg - written by Titian Cernicova-Dragomir and Kubilay Kahveci , with support and expertise from Joey Watts , Rob Palmer , and Tim McClure .
We’d like to extend our thanks to all of them!

## `ConstructorParameters` Works on Abstract Classes

In TypeScript 4.3, the `ConstructorParameters` type helper now works on `abstract` classes.



```id
tsabstract class C {  constructor(a: string, b: number) {    // ...  }}// Has the type '[a: string, b: number]'.type CParams = ConstructorParameters<typeof C>;
```



This is thanks to work done in TypeScript 4.2, where construct signatures can be marked as abstract:



```id
tstype MyConstructorOf<T> = {    abstract new(...args: any[]): T;}// or using the shorthand syntax:type MyConstructorOf<T> = abstract new (...args: any[]) => T;
```



You can see the change in more detail on GitHub .

## Contextual Narrowing for Generics

TypeScript 4.3 now includes some slightly smarter type-narrowing logic on generic values.
This allows TypeScript to accept more patterns, and sometimes even catch mistakes.

For some motivation, let’s say we’re trying to write a function called `makeUnique`.
It’ll take a `Set` or an `Array` of elements, and if it’s given an `Array`, it’ll sort that `Array` remove duplicates according to some comparison function.
After all that, it will return the original collection.



```id
tsfunction makeUnique<T>(  collection: Set<T> | T[],  comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): Set<T> | T[] {  // Early bail-out if we have a Set.  // We assume the elements are already unique.  if (collection instanceof Set) {    return collection;  }  // Sort the array, then remove consecutive duplicates.  collection.sort(comparer);  for (let i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {    let j = i;    while (      j < collection.length &&      comparer(collection[i], collection[j + 1]) === 0    ) {      j++;    }    collection.splice(i + 1, j - i);  }  return collection;}
```



Let’s leave questions about this function’s implementation aside, and assume it arose from the requirements of a broader application.
Something that you might notice is that the signature doesn’t capture the original type of `collection`.
We can do that by adding a type parameter called `C` in place of where we’ve written `Set | T[]`.



```id
diff- function makeUnique<T>(collection: Set<T> | T[], comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): Set<T> | T[]+ function makeUnique<T, C extends Set<T> | T[]>(collection: C, comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): C
```



In TypeScript 4.2 and earlier, you’d end up with a bunch of errors as soon as you tried this.



```id
tsfunction makeUnique<T, C extends Set<T> | T[]>(  collection: C,  comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): C {  // Early bail-out if we have a Set.  // We assume the elements are already unique.  if (collection instanceof Set) {    return collection;  }  // Sort the array, then remove consecutive duplicates.  collection.sort(comparer);  //         ~~~~  // error: Property 'sort' does not exist on type 'C'.  for (let i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {    //                             ~~~~~~    // error: Property 'length' does not exist on type 'C'.    let j = i;    while (      j < collection.length &&      comparer(collection[i], collection[j + 1]) === 0    ) {      //                    ~~~~~~      // error: Property 'length' does not exist on type 'C'.      //                                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      // error: Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'number'      //        can't be used to index type 'Set<T> | T[]'.      j++;    }    collection.splice(i + 1, j - i);    //         ~~~~~~    // error: Property 'splice' does not exist on type 'C'.  }  return collection;}
```



Ew, errors!
Why is TypeScript being so mean to us?

The issue is that when we perform our `collection instanceof Set` check, we’re expecting that to act as a type guard that narrows the type from `Set | T[]` to `Set ` and `T[]` depending on the branch we’re in;
however, we’re not dealing with a `Set | T[]`, we’re trying to narrow the generic value `collection`, whose type is `C`.

It’s a very subtle distinction, but it makes a difference.
TypeScript can’t just grab the constraint of `C` (which is `Set | T[]`) and narrow that.
If TypeScript did try to narrow from `Set | T[]`, it would forget that `collection` is also a `C` in each branch because there’s no easy way to preserve that information.
If hypothetically TypeScript tried that approach, it would break the above example in a different way.
At the return positions, where the function expects values with the type `C`, we would instead get a `Set ` and a `T[]` in each branch, which TypeScript would reject.



```id
tsfunction makeUnique<T>(  collection: Set<T> | T[],  comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): Set<T> | T[] {  // Early bail-out if we have a Set.  // We assume the elements are already unique.  if (collection instanceof Set) {    return collection;    //     ~~~~~~~~~~    // error: Type 'Set<T>' is not assignable to type 'C'.    //          'Set<T>' is assignable to the constraint of type 'C', but    //          'C' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint 'Set<T> | T[]'.  }  // ...  return collection;  //     ~~~~~~~~~~  // error: Type 'T[]' is not assignable to type 'C'.  //          'T[]' is assignable to the constraint of type 'C', but  //          'C' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint 'Set<T> | T[]'.}
```



So how does TypeScript 4.3 change things?
Well, basically in a few key places when writing code, all the type system really cares about is the constraint of a type.
For example, when we write `collection.length`, TypeScript doesn’t care about the fact that `collection` has the type `C`, it only cares about the properties available, which are determined by the constraint `T[] | Set `.

In cases like this, TypeScript will grab the narrowed type of the constraint because that will give you the data you care about;
however, in any other case, we’ll just try to narrow the original generic type (and often end up with the original generic type).

In other words, based on how you use a generic value, TypeScript will narrow it a little differently.
The end result is that the entire above example compiles with no type-checking errors.

## Always-Truthy Promise Checks

Under `strictNullChecks` , checking whether a `Promise` is “truthy” in a conditional will trigger an error.



```id
tsasync function foo(): Promise<boolean> {  return false;}async function bar(): Promise<string> {  if (foo()) {    //  ~~~~~    // Error!    // This condition will always return true since    // this 'Promise<boolean>' appears to always be defined.    // Did you forget to use 'await'?    return "true";  }  return "false";}
```



 This change was contributed by Jack Works , and we extend our thanks to them!

## `static` Index Signatures

Index signatures allow us to set more properties on a value than a type explicitly declares.



```id
tsclass Foo {  hello = "hello";  world = 1234;  // This is an index signature:  [propName: string]: string | number | undefined;}let instance = new Foo();// Valid assignmentinstance["whatever"] = 42;// Has type 'string | number | undefined'.let x = instance["something"];
```



Up until now, an index signature could only be declared on the instance side of a class.
Thanks to a pull request from Wenlu Wang , index signatures can now be declared as `static`.



```id
tsclass Foo {  static hello = "hello";  static world = 1234;  static [propName: string]: string | number | undefined;}// Valid.Foo["whatever"] = 42;// Has type 'string | number | undefined'let x = Foo["something"];
```



The same sorts of rules apply for index signatures on the static side of a class as they do for the instance side - namely, that every other static property has to be compatible with the index signature.



```id
tsclass Foo {  static prop = true;  //     ~~~~  // Error! Property 'prop' of type 'boolean'  // is not assignable to string index type  // 'string | number | undefined'.  static [propName: string]: string | number | undefined;}
```



## `.tsbuildinfo` Size Improvements

In TypeScript 4.3, `.tsbuildinfo` files that are generated as part of `incremental` builds should be significantly smaller.
This is thanks to several optimizations in the internal format, creating tables with numeric identifiers to be used throughout the file instead of repeating full paths and similar information.
This work was spear-headed by Tobias Koppers in their pull request , serving as inspiration for the ensuing pull request and further optimizations .

We have seen significant reductions of `.tsbuildinfo` file sizes including

 1MB to 411 KB

- 14.9MB to 1MB

- 1345MB to 467MB

Needless to say, these sorts of savings in size translate to slightly faster build times as well.

## Lazier Calculations in `--incremental` and `--watch` Compilations

One of the issues with `incremental` and `--watch` modes are that while they make later compilations go faster, the initial compilation can be a bit slower - in some cases, significantly slower.
This is because these modes have to perform a bunch of book-keeping, computing information about the current project, and sometimes saving that data in a `.tsbuildinfo` file for later builds.

That’s why on top of `.tsbuildinfo` size improvements, TypeScript 4.3 also ships some changes to `incremental` and `--watch` modes that make the first build of a project with these flags just as fast as an ordinary build!
To do this, much of the information that would ordinarily be computed up-front is instead done on an on-demand basis for later builds.
While this can add some overhead to a subsequent build, TypeScript’s `incremental` and `--watch` functionality will still typically operate on a much smaller set of files, and any needed information will be saved afterwards.
In a sense, `incremental` and `--watch` builds will “warm up” and get faster at compiling files once you’ve updated them a few times.

In a repository with 3000 files, this reduced initial build times to almost a third !

 This work was started by Tobias Koppers , whose work ensued in the resulting final change for this functionality.
We’d like to extend a great thanks to Tobias for helping us find these opportunities for improvements!

## Import Statement Completions

One of the biggest pain-points users run into with import and export statements in JavaScript is the order - specifically that imports are written as



```id
tsimport { func } from "./module.js";
```



instead of



```id
tsfrom "./module.js" import { func };
```



This causes some pain when writing out a full import statement from scratch because auto-complete wasn’t able to work correctly.
For example, if you start writing something like `import {`, TypeScript has no idea what module you’re planning on importing from, so it couldn’t provide any scoped-down completions.

To alleviate this, we’ve leveraged the power of auto-imports!
Auto-imports already deal with the issue of not being able to narrow down completions from a specific module - their whole point is to provide every possible export and automatically insert an import statement at the top of your file.

So when you now start writing an `import` statement that doesn’t have a path, we’ll provide you with a list of possible imports.
When you commit a completion, we’ll complete the full import statement, including the path that you were going to write.

 

This work requires editors that specifically support the feature.
You’ll be able to try this out by using the latest Insiders versions of Visual Studio Code .

For more information, take a look at the implementing pull request !

## Editor Support for `@link` Tags

TypeScript can now understand `@link` tags, and will try to resolve declarations that they link to.
What this means is that you’ll be able to hover over names within `@link` tags and get quick information, or use commands like go-to-definition or find-all-references.

For example, you’ll be able to go-to-definition on `plantCarrot` in `@link plantCarrot` in the example below and a TypeScript-supported editor will jump to `plantCarrot`’s function declaration.



```id
ts/** * To be called 70 to 80 days after {@link plantCarrot}. */function harvestCarrot(carrot: Carrot) {}/** * Call early in spring for best results. Added in v2.1.0. * @param seed Make sure it's a carrot seed! */function plantCarrot(seed: Seed) {  // TODO: some gardening}
```



 

For more information, see the pull request on GitHub !

## Go-to-Definition on Non-JavaScript File Paths

Many loaders allow users to include assets in their applications using JavaScript imports.
They’ll typically be written as something like `import "./styles.css"` or the like.

Up until now, TypeScript’s editor functionality wouldn’t even attempt to read this file, so go-to-definition would typically fail.
At best, go-to-definition would jump to a declaration like `declare module "*.css"` if it could find something along those lines.

TypeScript’s language service now tries to jump to the correct file when you perform a go-to-definition on relative file paths, even if they’re not JavaScript or TypeScript files!
Try it out with imports to CSS, SVGs, PNGs, font files, Vue files, and more.

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

As with every TypeScript version, declarations for `lib.d.ts` (especially the declarations generated for web contexts), have changed.
In this release, we leveraged Mozilla’s browser-compat-data to remove APIs that no browser implements.
While it is unlike that you are using them, APIs such as `Account`, `AssertionOptions`, `RTCStatsEventInit`, `MSGestureEvent`, `DeviceLightEvent`, `MSPointerEvent`, `ServiceWorkerMessageEvent`, and `WebAuthentication` have all been removed from `lib.d.ts`.
This is discussed in some detail here .

 https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator/issues/991 

### `useDefineForClassFields` now defaults to true on `esnext` and eventually on `es2022`

In 2021 the class fields feature was added into the JavaScript specification with behavior which differed from how TypeScript had implemented it. In preparation for this, in TypeScript 3.7, a flag was added ( `useDefineForClassFields` ) to migrate to emitted JavaScript to match the JavaScript standard behavior.

Now that the feature is in JavaScript we are changing the default to `true` for ES2022 and above, including ESNext.

### Errors on Always-Truthy Promise Checks

Under `strictNullChecks` , using a `Promise` that always appears to be defined within a condition check is now considered an error.



```id
tsdeclare var p: Promise<number>;if (p) {  //  ~  // Error!  // This condition will always return true since  // this 'Promise<number>' appears to always be defined.  //  // Did you forget to use 'await'?}
```



For more details, see the original change .

### Union Enums Cannot Be Compared to Arbitrary Numbers

Certain `enum`s are considered union `enum`s when their members are either automatically filled in, or trivially written.
In those cases, an enum can recall each value that it potentially represents.

In TypeScript 4.3, if a value with a union `enum` type is compared with a numeric literal that it could never be equal to, then the type-checker will issue an error.



```id
tsenum E {  A = 0,  B = 1,}function doSomething(x: E) {  // Error! This condition will always return 'false' since the types 'E' and '-1' have no overlap.  if (x === -1) {    // ...  }}
```



As a workaround, you can re-write an annotation to include the appropriate literal type.



```id
tsenum E {  A = 0,  B = 1,}// Include -1 in the type, if we're really certain that -1 can come through.function doSomething(x: E | -1) {  if (x === -1) {    // ...  }}
```



You can also use a type-assertion on the value.



```id
tsenum E {  A = 0,  B = 1,}function doSomething(x: E) {  // Use a type assertion on 'x' because we know we're not actually just dealing with values from 'E'.  if ((x as number) === -1) {    // ...  }}
```



Alternatively, you can re-declare your enum to have a non-trivial initializer so that any number is both assignable and comparable to that enum. This may be useful if the intent is for the enum to specify a few well-known values.



```id
tsenum E {  // the leading + on 0 opts TypeScript out of inferring a union enum.  A = +0,  B = 1,}
```

## Decorators

Decorators are an upcoming ECMAScript feature that allow us to customize classes and their members in a reusable way.

Let’s consider the following code:



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}const p = new Person("Ray");p.greet();
```



`greet` is pretty simple here, but let’s imagine it’s something way more complicated - maybe it does some async logic, it’s recursive, it has side effects, etc.
Regardless of what kind of ball-of-mud you’re imagining, let’s say you throw in some `console.log` calls to help debug `greet`.



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    greet() {        console.log("LOG: Entering method.");        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);        console.log("LOG: Exiting method.")    }}
```



This pattern is fairly common.
It sure would be nice if there was a way we could do this for every method!

This is where decorators come in.
We can write a function called `loggedMethod` that looks like the following:



```id
tsfunction loggedMethod(originalMethod: any, _context: any) {    function replacementMethod(this: any, ...args: any[]) {        console.log("LOG: Entering method.")        const result = originalMethod.call(this, ...args);        console.log("LOG: Exiting method.")        return result;    }    return replacementMethod;}
```



“What’s the deal with all of these `any`s?
What is this, `any`Script!?”

Just be patient - we’re keeping things simple for now so that we can focus on what this function is doing.
Notice that `loggedMethod` takes the original method (`originalMethod`) and returns a function that

 logs an “Entering…” message

- passes along `this` and all of its arguments to the original method

- logs an “Exiting…” message, and

- returns whatever the original method returned.

Now we can use `loggedMethod` to decorate the method `greet`:



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    @loggedMethod    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}const p = new Person("Ray");p.greet();// Output:////   LOG: Entering method.//   Hello, my name is Ray.//   LOG: Exiting method.
```



We just used `loggedMethod` as a decorator above `greet` - and notice that we wrote it as `@loggedMethod`.
When we did that, it got called with the method target and a context object .
Because `loggedMethod` returned a new function, that function replaced the original definition of `greet`.

We didn’t mention it yet, but `loggedMethod` was defined with a second parameter.
It’s called a “context object”, and it has some useful information about how the decorated method was declared - like whether it was a `#private` member, or `static`, or what the name of the method was.
Let’s rewrite `loggedMethod` to take advantage of that and print out the name of the method that was decorated.



```id
tsfunction loggedMethod(originalMethod: any, context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext) {    const methodName = String(context.name);    function replacementMethod(this: any, ...args: any[]) {        console.log(`LOG: Entering method '${methodName}'.`)        const result = originalMethod.call(this, ...args);        console.log(`LOG: Exiting method '${methodName}'.`)        return result;    }    return replacementMethod;}
```



We’re now using the context parameter - and that it’s the first thing in `loggedMethod` that has a type stricter than `any` and `any[]`.
TypeScript provides a type called `ClassMethodDecoratorContext` that models the context object that method decorators take.

Apart from metadata, the context object for methods also has a useful function called `addInitializer`.
It’s a way to hook into the beginning of the constructor (or the initialization of the class itself if we’re working with `static`s).

As an example - in JavaScript, it’s common to write something like the following pattern:



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;        this.greet = this.greet.bind(this);    }    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}
```



Alternatively, `greet` might be declared as a property initialized to an arrow function.



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    greet = () => {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    };}
```



This code is written to ensure that `this` isn’t re-bound if `greet` is called as a stand-alone function or passed as a callback.



```id
tsconst greet = new Person("Ray").greet;// We don't want this to fail!greet();
```



We can write a decorator that uses `addInitializer` to call `bind` in the constructor for us.



```id
tsfunction bound(originalMethod: any, context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext) {    const methodName = context.name;    if (context.private) {        throw new Error(`'bound' cannot decorate private properties like ${methodName as string}.`);    }    context.addInitializer(function () {        this[methodName] = this[methodName].bind(this);    });}
```



`bound` isn’t returning anything - so when it decorates a method, it leaves the original alone.
Instead, it will add logic before any other fields are initialized.



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    @bound    @loggedMethod    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}const p = new Person("Ray");const greet = p.greet;// Works!greet();
```



Notice that we stacked two decorators - `@bound` and `@loggedMethod`.
These decorations run in “reverse order”.
That is, `@loggedMethod` decorates the original method `greet`, and `@bound` decorates the result of `@loggedMethod`.
In this example, it doesn’t matter - but it could if your decorators have side-effects or expect a certain order.

Also worth noting - if you’d prefer stylistically, you can put these decorators on the same line.



```id
ts    @bound @loggedMethod greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }
```



Something that might not be obvious is that we can even make functions that return decorator functions.
That makes it possible to customize the final decorator just a little.
If we wanted, we could have made `loggedMethod` return a decorator and customize how it logs its messages.



```id
tsfunction loggedMethod(headMessage = "LOG:") {    return function actualDecorator(originalMethod: any, context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext) {        const methodName = String(context.name);        function replacementMethod(this: any, ...args: any[]) {            console.log(`${headMessage} Entering method '${methodName}'.`)            const result = originalMethod.call(this, ...args);            console.log(`${headMessage} Exiting method '${methodName}'.`)            return result;        }        return replacementMethod;    }}
```



If we did that, we’d have to call `loggedMethod` before using it as a decorator.
We could then pass in any string as the prefix for messages that get logged to the console.



```id
tsclass Person {    name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }    @loggedMethod("⚠️")    greet() {        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);    }}const p = new Person("Ray");p.greet();// Output:////   ⚠️ Entering method 'greet'.//   Hello, my name is Ray.//   ⚠️ Exiting method 'greet'.
```



Decorators can be used on more than just methods!
They can be used on properties/fields, getters, setters, and auto-accessors.
Even classes themselves can be decorated for things like subclassing and registration.

To learn more about decorators in-depth, you can read up on Axel Rauschmayer’s extensive summary .

For more information about the changes involved, you can view the original pull request .

### Differences with Experimental Legacy Decorators

If you’ve been using TypeScript for a while, you might be aware of the fact that it’s had support for “experimental” decorators for years.
While these experimental decorators have been incredibly useful, they modeled a much older version of the decorators proposal, and always required an opt-in compiler flag called `--experimentalDecorators`.
Any attempt to use decorators in TypeScript without this flag used to prompt an error message.

`--experimentalDecorators` will continue to exist for the foreseeable future;
however, without the flag, decorators will now be valid syntax for all new code.
Outside of `--experimentalDecorators`, they will be type-checked and emitted differently.
The type-checking rules and emit are sufficiently different that while decorators can be written to support both the old and new decorators behavior, any existing decorator functions are not likely to do so.

This new decorators proposal is not compatible with `--emitDecoratorMetadata`, and it does not allow decorating parameters.
Future ECMAScript proposals may be able to help bridge that gap.

On a final note: in addition to allowing decorators to be placed before the `export` keyword, the proposal for decorators now provides the option of placing decorators after `export` or `export default`.
The only exception is that mixing the two styles is not allowed.



```id
js// ✅ allowed@register export default class Foo {    // ...}// ✅ also allowedexport default @register class Bar {    // ...}// ❌ error - before *and* after is not allowed@before export @after class Bar {    // ...}
```



### Writing Well-Typed Decorators

The `loggedMethod` and `bound` decorator examples above are intentionally simple and omit lots of details about types.

Typing decorators can be fairly complex.
For example, a well-typed version of `loggedMethod` from above might look something like this:



```id
tsfunction loggedMethod<This, Args extends any[], Return>(    target: (this: This, ...args: Args) => Return,    context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext<This, (this: This, ...args: Args) => Return>) {    const methodName = String(context.name);    function replacementMethod(this: This, ...args: Args): Return {        console.log(`LOG: Entering method '${methodName}'.`)        const result = target.call(this, ...args);        console.log(`LOG: Exiting method '${methodName}'.`)        return result;    }    return replacementMethod;}
```



We had to separately model out the type of `this`, the parameters, and the return type of the original method, using the type parameters `This`, `Args`, and `Return`.

Exactly how complex your decorators functions are defined depends on what you want to guarantee.
Just keep in mind, your decorators will be used more than they’re written, so a well-typed version will usually be preferable - but there’s clearly a trade-off with readability, so try to keep things simple.

More documentation on writing decorators will be available in the future - but this post should have a good amount of detail for the mechanics of decorators.

## `const` Type Parameters

When inferring the type of an object, TypeScript will usually choose a type that’s meant to be general.
For example, in this case, the inferred type of `names` is `string[]`:



```id
tstype HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };function getNamesExactly<T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T["names"] {    return arg.names;}// Inferred type: string[]const names = getNamesExactly({ names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]});
```



Usually the intent of this is to enable mutation down the line.

However, depending on what exactly `getNamesExactly` does and how it’s intended to be used, it can often be the case that a more-specific type is desired.

Up until now, API authors have typically had to recommend adding `as const` in certain places to achieve the desired inference:



```id
ts// The type we wanted://    readonly ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]// The type we got://    string[]const names1 = getNamesExactly({ names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]});// Correctly gets what we wanted://    readonly ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]const names2 = getNamesExactly({ names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]} as const);
```



This can be cumbersome and easy to forget.
In TypeScript 5.0, you can now add a `const` modifier to a type parameter declaration to cause `const`-like inference to be the default:



```id
tstype HasNames = { names: readonly string[] };function getNamesExactly<const T extends HasNames>(arg: T): T["names"] {//                       ^^^^^    return arg.names;}// Inferred type: readonly ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]// Note: Didn't need to write 'as const' hereconst names = getNamesExactly({ names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"] });
```



Note that the `const` modifier doesn’t reject mutable values, and doesn’t require immutable constraints.
Using a mutable type constraint might give surprising results.
For example:



```id
tsdeclare function fnBad<const T extends string[]>(args: T): void;// 'T' is still 'string[]' since 'readonly ["a", "b", "c"]' is not assignable to 'string[]'fnBad(["a", "b" ,"c"]);
```



Here, the inferred candidate for `T` is `readonly ["a", "b", "c"]`, and a `readonly` array can’t be used where a mutable one is needed.
In this case, inference falls back to the constraint, the array is treated as `string[]`, and the call still proceeds successfully.

A better definition of this function should use `readonly string[]`:



```id
tsdeclare function fnGood<const T extends readonly string[]>(args: T): void;// T is readonly ["a", "b", "c"]fnGood(["a", "b" ,"c"]);
```



Similarly, remember to keep in mind that the `const` modifier only affects inference of object, array and primitive expressions that were written within the call, so arguments which wouldn’t (or couldn’t) be modified with `as const` won’t see any change in behavior:



```id
tsdeclare function fnGood<const T extends readonly string[]>(args: T): void;const arr = ["a", "b" ,"c"];// 'T' is still 'string[]'-- the 'const' modifier has no effect herefnGood(arr);
```



 See the pull request and the ( first and second ) motivating issues for more details.

## Supporting Multiple Configuration Files in `extends`

When managing multiple projects, it can be helpful to have a “base” configuration file that other `tsconfig.json` files can extend from.
That’s why TypeScript supports an `extends` field for copying over fields from `compilerOptions`.



```id
jsonc// packages/front-end/src/tsconfig.json{    "extends": "../../../tsconfig.base.json",    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "../lib",        // ...    }}
```



However, there are scenarios where you might want to extend from multiple configuration files.
For example, imagine using a TypeScript base configuration file shipped to npm .
If you want all your projects to also use the options from the `@tsconfig/strictest` package on npm, then there’s a simple solution: have `tsconfig.base.json` extend from `@tsconfig/strictest`:



```id
jsonc// tsconfig.base.json{    "extends": "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",    "compilerOptions": {        // ...    }}
```



This works to a point.
If you have any projects that don’t want to use `@tsconfig/strictest`, they have to either manually disable the options, or create a separate version of `tsconfig.base.json` that doesn’t extend from `@tsconfig/strictest`.

To give some more flexibility here, Typescript 5.0 now allows the `extends` field to take multiple entries.
For example, in this configuration file:



```id
jsonc{    "extends": ["a", "b", "c"],    "compilerOptions": {        // ...    }}
```



Writing this is kind of like extending `c` directly, where `c` extends `b`, and `b` extends `a`.
If any fields “conflict”, the latter entry wins.

So in the following example, both `strictNullChecks` and `noImplicitAny` are enabled in the final `tsconfig.json`.



```id
jsonc// tsconfig1.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "strictNullChecks": true    }}// tsconfig2.json{    "compilerOptions": {        "noImplicitAny": true    }}// tsconfig.json{    "extends": ["./tsconfig1.json", "./tsconfig2.json"],    "files": ["./index.ts"]}
```



As another example, we can rewrite our original example in the following way.



```id
jsonc// packages/front-end/src/tsconfig.json{    "extends": ["@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json", "../../../tsconfig.base.json"],    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "../lib",        // ...    }}
```

## All `enum`s Are Union `enum`s

When TypeScript originally introduced enums, they were nothing more than a set of numeric constants with the same type.



```id
tsenum E {    Foo = 10,    Bar = 20,}
```



The only thing special about `E.Foo` and `E.Bar` was that they were assignable to anything expecting the type `E`.
Other than that, they were pretty much just `number`s.



```id
tsfunction takeValue(e: E) {}takeValue(E.Foo); // workstakeValue(123); // error!
```



It wasn’t until TypeScript 2.0 introduced enum literal types that enums got a bit more special.
Enum literal types gave each enum member its own type, and turned the enum itself into a union of each member type.
They also allowed us to refer to only a subset of the types of an enum, and to narrow away those types.



```id
ts// Color is like a union of Red | Orange | Yellow | Green | Blue | Violetenum Color {    Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, /* Indigo, */ Violet}// Each enum member has its own type that we can refer to!type PrimaryColor = Color.Red | Color.Green | Color.Blue;function isPrimaryColor(c: Color): c is PrimaryColor {    // Narrowing literal types can catch bugs.    // TypeScript will error here because    // we'll end up comparing 'Color.Red' to 'Color.Green'.    // We meant to use ||, but accidentally wrote &&.    return c === Color.Red && c === Color.Green && c === Color.Blue;}
```



One issue with giving each enum member its own type was that those types were in some part associated with the actual value of the member.
In some cases it’s not possible to compute that value - for instance, an enum member could be initialized by a function call.



```id
tsenum E {    Blah = Math.random()}
```



Whenever TypeScript ran into these issues, it would quietly back out and use the old enum strategy.
That meant giving up all the advantages of unions and literal types.

TypeScript 5.0 manages to make all enums into union enums by creating a unique type for each computed member.
That means that all enums can now be narrowed and have their members referenced as types as well.

For more details on this change, you can read the specifics on GitHub .

## `--moduleResolution bundler`

TypeScript 4.7 introduced the `node16` and `nodenext` options for its `--module` and `--moduleResolution` settings.
The intent of these options was to better model the precise lookup rules for ECMAScript modules in Node.js;
however, this mode has many restrictions that other tools don’t really enforce.

For example, in an ECMAScript module in Node.js, any relative import needs to include a file extension.



```id
js// entry.mjsimport * as utils from "./utils";     // ❌ wrong - we need to include the file extension.import * as utils from "./utils.mjs"; // ✅ works
```



There are certain reasons for this in Node.js and the browser - it makes file lookups faster and works better for naive file servers.
But for many developers using tools like bundlers, the `node16`/`nodenext` settings were cumbersome because bundlers don’t have most of these restrictions.
In some ways, the `node` resolution mode was better for anyone using a bundler.

But in some ways, the original `node` resolution mode was already out of date.
Most modern bundlers use a fusion of the ECMAScript module and CommonJS lookup rules in Node.js.
For example, extensionless imports work just fine just like in CommonJS, but when looking through the `export` conditions of a package, they’ll prefer an `import` condition just like in an ECMAScript file.

To model how bundlers work, TypeScript now introduces a new strategy: `--moduleResolution bundler`.



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "target": "esnext",        "moduleResolution": "bundler"    }}
```



If you are using a modern bundler like Vite, esbuild, swc, Webpack, Parcel, and others that implement a hybrid lookup strategy, the new `bundler` option should be a good fit for you.

On the other hand, if you’re writing a library that’s meant to be published on npm, using the `bundler` option can hide compatibility issues that may arise for your users who aren’t using a bundler.
So in these cases, using the `node16` or `nodenext` resolution options is likely to be a better path.

To read more on `--moduleResolution bundler`, take a look at the implementing pull request .

## Resolution Customization Flags

JavaScript tooling may now model “hybrid” resolution rules, like in the `bundler` mode we described above.
Because tools may differ in their support slightly, TypeScript 5.0 provides ways to enable or disable a few features that may or may not work with your configuration.

### `allowImportingTsExtensions`

`--allowImportingTsExtensions` allows TypeScript files to import each other with a TypeScript-specific extension like `.ts`, `.mts`, or `.tsx`.

This flag is only allowed when `--noEmit` or `--emitDeclarationOnly` is enabled, since these import paths would not be resolvable at runtime in JavaScript output files.
The expectation here is that your resolver (e.g. your bundler, a runtime, or some other tool) is going to make these imports between `.ts` files work.

### `resolvePackageJsonExports`

`--resolvePackageJsonExports` forces TypeScript to consult the `exports` field of `package.json` files if it ever reads from a package in `node_modules`.

This option defaults to `true` under the `node16`, `nodenext`, and `bundler` options for `--moduleResolution`.

### `resolvePackageJsonImports`

`--resolvePackageJsonImports` forces TypeScript to consult the `imports` field of `package.json` files when performing a lookup that starts with `#` from a file whose ancestor directory contains a `package.json`.

This option defaults to `true` under the `node16`, `nodenext`, and `bundler` options for `--moduleResolution`.

### `allowArbitraryExtensions`

In TypeScript 5.0, when an import path ends in an extension that isn’t a known JavaScript or TypeScript file extension, the compiler will look for a declaration file for that path in the form of `{file basename}.d.{extension}.ts`.
For example, if you are using a CSS loader in a bundler project, you might want to write (or generate) declaration files for those stylesheets:



```id
css/* app.css */.cookie-banner {  display: none;}
```




```id
ts// app.d.css.tsdeclare const css: {  cookieBanner: string;};export default css;
```




```id
ts// App.tsximport styles from "./app.css";styles.cookieBanner; // string
```



By default, this import will raise an error to let you know that TypeScript doesn’t understand this file type and your runtime might not support importing it.
But if you’ve configured your runtime or bundler to handle it, you can suppress the error with the new `--allowArbitraryExtensions` compiler option.

Note that historically, a similar effect has often been achievable by adding a declaration file named `app.css.d.ts` instead of `app.d.css.ts` - however, this just worked through Node’s `require` resolution rules for CommonJS.
Strictly speaking, the former is interpreted as a declaration file for a JavaScript file named `app.css.js`.
Because relative files imports need to include extensions in Node’s ESM support, TypeScript would error on our example in an ESM file under `--moduleResolution node16` or `nodenext`.

For more information, read up the proposal for this feature and its corresponding pull request .

### `customConditions`

`--customConditions` takes a list of additional conditions that should succeed when TypeScript resolves from an `exports` or `imports` field of a `package.json`.
These conditions are added to whatever existing conditions a resolver will use by default.

For example, when this field is set in a `tsconfig.json` as so:



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "target": "es2022",        "moduleResolution": "bundler",        "customConditions": ["my-condition"]    }}
```



Any time an `exports` or `imports` field is referenced in `package.json`, TypeScript will consider conditions called `my-condition`.

So when importing from a package with the following `package.json`



```id
jsonc{    // ...    "exports": {        ".": {            "my-condition": "./foo.mjs",            "node": "./bar.mjs",            "import": "./baz.mjs",            "require": "./biz.mjs"        }    }}
```



TypeScript will try to look for files corresponding to `foo.mjs`.

This field is only valid under the `node16`, `nodenext`, and `bundler` options for `--moduleResolution`

## `--verbatimModuleSyntax`

By default, TypeScript does something called import elision .
Basically, if you write something like



```id
tsimport { Car } from "./car";export function drive(car: Car) {    // ...}
```



TypeScript detects that you’re only using an import for types and drops the import entirely.
Your output JavaScript might look something like this:



```id
jsexport function drive(car) {    // ...}
```



Most of the time this is good, because if `Car` isn’t a value that’s exported from `./car`, we’ll get a runtime error.

But it does add a layer of complexity for certain edge cases.
For example, notice there’s no statement like `import "./car";` - the import was dropped entirely.
That actually makes a difference for modules that have side-effects or not.

TypeScript’s emit strategy for JavaScript also has another few layers of complexity - import elision isn’t always just driven by how an import is used - it often consults how a value is declared as well.
So it’s not always clear whether code like the following



```id
tsexport { Car } from "./car";
```



should be preserved or dropped.
If `Car` is declared with something like a `class`, then it can be preserved in the resulting JavaScript file.
But if `Car` is only declared as a `type` alias or `interface`, then the JavaScript file shouldn’t export `Car` at all.

While TypeScript might be able to make these emit decisions based on information from across files, not every compiler can.

The `type` modifier on imports and exports helps with these situations a bit.
We can make it explicit whether an import or export is only being used for type analysis, and can be dropped entirely in JavaScript files by using the `type` modifier.



```id
ts// This statement can be dropped entirely in JS outputimport type * as car from "./car";// The named import/export 'Car' can be dropped in JS outputimport { type Car } from "./car";export { type Car } from "./car";
```



`type` modifiers are not quite useful on their own - by default, module elision will still drop imports, and nothing forces you to make the distinction between `type` and plain imports and exports.
So TypeScript has the flag `--importsNotUsedAsValues` to make sure you use the `type` modifier, `--preserveValueImports` to prevent some module elision behavior, and `--isolatedModules` to make sure that your TypeScript code works across different compilers.
Unfortunately, understanding the fine details of those 3 flags is hard, and there are still some edge cases with unexpected behavior.

TypeScript 5.0 introduces a new option called `--verbatimModuleSyntax` to simplify the situation.
The rules are much simpler - any imports or exports without a `type` modifier are left around.
Anything that uses the `type` modifier is dropped entirely.



```id
ts// Erased away entirely.import type { A } from "a";// Rewritten to 'import { b } from "bcd";'import { b, type c, type d } from "bcd";// Rewritten to 'import {} from "xyz";'import { type xyz } from "xyz";
```



With this new option, what you see is what you get.

That does have some implications when it comes to module interop though.
Under this flag, ECMAScript `import`s and `export`s won’t be rewritten to `require` calls when your settings or file extension implied a different module system.
Instead, you’ll get an error.
If you need to emit code that uses `require` and `module.exports`, you’ll have to use TypeScript’s module syntax that predates ES2015:

 
 
 
 Input TypeScript 
 Output JavaScript 
 
 
 
 


```id
tsimport foo = require("foo");
```


 
 


```id
jsconst foo = require("foo");
```


 
 
 
 


```id
tsfunction foo() {}function bar() {}function baz() {}export = {    foo,    bar,    baz};
```


 
 


```id
jsfunction foo() {}function bar() {}function baz() {}module.exports = {    foo,    bar,    baz};
```


 
 
 

While this is a limitation, it does help make some issues more obvious.
For example, it’s very common to forget to set the `type` field in `package.json` under `--module node16`.
As a result, developers would start writing CommonJS modules instead of ES modules without realizing it, giving surprising lookup rules and JavaScript output.
This new flag ensures that you’re intentional about the file type you’re using because the syntax is intentionally different.

Because `--verbatimModuleSyntax` provides a more consistent story than `--importsNotUsedAsValues` and `--preserveValueImports`, those two existing flags are being deprecated in its favor.

For more details, read up on [the original pull request] https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/52203 and its proposal issue .

## Support for `export type *`

When TypeScript 3.8 introduced type-only imports, the new syntax wasn’t allowed on `export * from "module"` or `export * as ns from "module"` re-exports. TypeScript 5.0 adds support for both of these forms:



```id
ts// models/vehicles.tsexport class Spaceship {  // ...}// models/index.tsexport type * as vehicles from "./vehicles";// main.tsimport { vehicles } from "./models";function takeASpaceship(s: vehicles.Spaceship) {  // ✅ ok - `vehicles` only used in a type position}function makeASpaceship() {  return new vehicles.Spaceship();  //         ^^^^^^^^  // 'vehicles' cannot be used as a value because it was exported using 'export type'.}
```



You can read more about the implementation here .

## `@satisfies` Support in JSDoc

TypeScript 4.9 introduced the `satisfies` operator.
It made sure that the type of an expression was compatible, without affecting the type itself.
For example, let’s take the following code:



```id
tsinterface CompilerOptions {    strict?: boolean;    outDir?: string;    // ...}interface ConfigSettings {    compilerOptions?: CompilerOptions;    extends?: string | string[];    // ...}let myConfigSettings = {    compilerOptions: {        strict: true,        outDir: "../lib",        // ...    },    extends: [        "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",        "../../../tsconfig.base.json"    ],} satisfies ConfigSettings;
```



Here, TypeScript knows that `myConfigSettings.extends` was declared with an array - because while `satisfies` validated the type of our object, it didn’t bluntly change it to `CompilerOptions` and lose information.
So if we want to map over `extends`, that’s fine.



```id
tsdeclare function resolveConfig(configPath: string): CompilerOptions;let inheritedConfigs = myConfigSettings.extends.map(resolveConfig);
```



This was helpful for TypeScript users, but plenty of people use TypeScript to type-check their JavaScript code using JSDoc annotations.
That’s why TypeScript 5.0 is supporting a new JSDoc tag called `@satisfies` that does exactly the same thing.

`/** @satisfies */` can catch type mismatches:



```id
js// @ts-check/** * @typedef CompilerOptions * @prop {boolean} [strict] * @prop {string} [outDir] *//** * @satisfies {CompilerOptions} */let myCompilerOptions = {    outdir: "../lib",//  ~~~~~~ oops! we meant outDir};
```



But it will preserve the original type of our expressions, allowing us to use our values more precisely later on in our code.



```id
js// @ts-check/** * @typedef CompilerOptions * @prop {boolean} [strict] * @prop {string} [outDir] *//** * @typedef ConfigSettings * @prop {CompilerOptions} [compilerOptions] * @prop {string | string[]} [extends] *//** * @satisfies {ConfigSettings} */let myConfigSettings = {    compilerOptions: {        strict: true,        outDir: "../lib",    },    extends: [        "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",        "../../../tsconfig.base.json"    ],};let inheritedConfigs = myConfigSettings.extends.map(resolveConfig);
```



`/** @satisfies */` can also be used inline on any parenthesized expression.
We could have written `myCompilerOptions` like this:



```id
tslet myConfigSettings = /** @satisfies {ConfigSettings} */ ({    compilerOptions: {        strict: true,        outDir: "../lib",    },    extends: [        "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",        "../../../tsconfig.base.json"    ],});
```



Why?
Well, it usually makes more sense when you’re deeper in some other code, like a function call.



```id
jscompileCode(/** @satisfies {CompilerOptions} */ ({    // ...}));
```



 This feature was provided thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk !

## `@overload` Support in JSDoc

In TypeScript, you can specify overloads for a function.
Overloads give us a way to say that a function can be called with different arguments, and possibly return different results.
They can restrict how callers can actually use our functions, and refine what results they’ll get back.



```id
ts// Our overloads:function printValue(str: string): void;function printValue(num: number, maxFractionDigits?: number): void;// Our implementation:function printValue(value: string | number, maximumFractionDigits?: number) {    if (typeof value === "number") {        const formatter = Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {            maximumFractionDigits,        });        value = formatter.format(value);    }    console.log(value);}
```



Here, we’ve said that `printValue` takes either a `string` or a `number` as its first argument.
If it takes a `number`, it can take a second argument to determine how many fractional digits we can print.

TypeScript 5.0 now allows JSDoc to declare overloads with a new `@overload` tag.
Each JSDoc comment with an `@overload` tag is treated as a distinct overload for the following function declaration.



```id
js// @ts-check/** * @overload * @param {string} value * @return {void} *//** * @overload * @param {number} value * @param {number} [maximumFractionDigits] * @return {void} *//** * @param {string | number} value * @param {number} [maximumFractionDigits] */function printValue(value, maximumFractionDigits) {    if (typeof value === "number") {        const formatter = Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {            maximumFractionDigits,        });        value = formatter.format(value);    }    console.log(value);}
```



Now regardless of whether we’re writing in a TypeScript or JavaScript file, TypeScript can let us know if we’ve called our functions incorrectly.



```id
ts// all allowedprintValue("hello!");printValue(123.45);printValue(123.45, 2);printValue("hello!", 123); // error!
```



This new tag was implemented thanks to Tomasz Lenarcik .

## Passing Emit-Specific Flags Under `--build`

TypeScript now allows the following flags to be passed under `--build` mode

- `--declaration`

- `--emitDeclarationOnly`

- `--declarationMap`

- `--sourceMap`

- `--inlineSourceMap`

This makes it way easier to customize certain parts of a build where you might have different development and production builds.

For example, a development build of a library might not need to produce declaration files, but a production build would.
A project can configure declaration emit to be off by default and simply be built with



```id
shtsc --build -p ./my-project-dir
```



Once you’re done iterating in the inner loop, a “production” build can just pass the `--declaration` flag.



```id
shtsc --build -p ./my-project-dir --declaration
```



 More information on this change is available here .

## Case-Insensitive Import Sorting in Editors

In editors like Visual Studio and VS Code, TypeScript powers the experience for organizing and sorting imports and exports.
Often though, there can be different interpretations of when a list is “sorted”.

For example, is the following import list sorted?



```id
tsimport {    Toggle,    freeze,    toBoolean,} from "./utils";
```



The answer might surprisingly be “it depends”.
If we don’t care about case-sensitivity, then this list is clearly not sorted.
The letter `f` comes before both `t` and `T`.

But in most programming languages, sorting defaults to comparing the byte values of strings.
The way JavaScript compares strings means that `"Toggle"` always comes before `"freeze"` because according to the ASCII character encoding , uppercase letters come before lowercase.
So from that perspective, the import list is sorted.

TypeScript previously considered the import list to be sorted because it was doing a basic case-sensitive sort.
This could be a point of frustration for developers who preferred a case- insensitive ordering, or who used tools like ESLint which require case-insensitive ordering by default.

TypeScript now detects case sensitivity by default.
This means that TypeScript and tools like ESLint typically won’t “fight” each other over how to best sort imports.

Our team has also been experimenting with further sorting strategies which you can read about here .
These options may eventually be configurable by editors.
For now, they are still unstable and experimental, and you can opt into them in VS Code today by using the `typescript.unstable` entry in your JSON options.
Below are all of the options you can try out (set to their defaults):



```id
jsonc{    "typescript.unstable": {        // Should sorting be case-sensitive? Can be:        // - true        // - false        // - "auto" (auto-detect)        "organizeImportsIgnoreCase": "auto",        // Should sorting be "ordinal" and use code points or consider Unicode rules? Can be:        // - "ordinal"        // - "unicode"        "organizeImportsCollation": "ordinal",        // Under `"organizeImportsCollation": "unicode"`,        // what is the current locale? Can be:        // - [any other locale code]        // - "auto" (use the editor's locale)        "organizeImportsLocale": "en",        // Under `"organizeImportsCollation": "unicode"`,        // should upper-case letters or lower-case letters come first? Can be:        // - false (locale-specific)        // - "upper"        // - "lower"        "organizeImportsCaseFirst": false,        // Under `"organizeImportsCollation": "unicode"`,        // do runs of numbers get compared numerically (i.e. "a1" < "a2" < "a100")? Can be:        // - true        // - false        "organizeImportsNumericCollation": true,        // Under `"organizeImportsCollation": "unicode"`,        // do letters with accent marks/diacritics get sorted distinctly        // from their "base" letter (i.e. is é different from e)? Can be        // - true        // - false        "organizeImportsAccentCollation": true    },    "javascript.unstable": {        // same options valid here...    },}
```



You can read more details on the original work for auto-detecting and specifying case-insensitivity , followed by the the broader set of options .

## Exhaustive `switch`/`case` Completions

When writing a `switch` statement, TypeScript now detects when the value being checked has a literal type.
If so, it will offer a completion that scaffolds out each uncovered `case`.

 

You can see specifics of the implementation on GitHub .

## Speed, Memory, and Package Size Optimizations

TypeScript 5.0 contains lots of powerful changes across our code structure, our data structures, and algorithmic implementations.
What these all mean is that your entire experience should be faster - not just running TypeScript, but even installing it.

Here are a few interesting wins in speed and size that we’ve been able to capture relative to TypeScript 4.9.

 
 
 
 Scenario 
 Time or Size Relative to TS 4.9 
 
 
 
 
 material-ui build time 
 89% 
 
 
 TypeScript Compiler startup time 
 89% 
 
 
 Playwright build time 
 88% 
 
 
 TypeScript Compiler self-build time 
 87% 
 
 
 Outlook Web build time 
 82% 
 
 
 VS Code build time 
 80% 
 
 
 typescript npm Package Size 
 59% 
 
 
 

 

How?
There are a few notable improvements we’d like give more details on in the future.
But we won’t make you wait for that blog post.

First off, we recently migrated TypeScript from namespaces to modules, allowing us to leverage modern build tooling that can perform optimizations like scope hoisting.
Using this tooling, revisiting our packaging strategy, and removing some deprecated code has shaved off about 26.4 MB from TypeScript 4.9’s 63.8 MB package size.
It also brought us a notable speed-up through direct function calls.

TypeScript also added more uniformity to internal object types within the compiler, and also slimmed the data stored on some of these object types as well.
This reduced polymorphic and megamorphic use sites, while offsetting most of the necessary memory consumption that was necessary for uniform shapes.

We’ve also performed some caching when serializing information to strings.
Type display, which can happen as part of error reporting, declaration emit, code completions, and more, can end up being fairly expensive.
TypeScript now caches some commonly used machinery to reuse across these operations.

Another notable change we made that improved our parser was leveraging `var` to occasionally side-step the cost of using `let` and `const` across closures.
This improved some of our parsing performance.

Overall, we expect most codebases should see speed improvements from TypeScript 5.0, and have consistently been able to reproduce wins between 10% to 20%.
Of course this will depend on hardware and codebase characteristics, but we encourage you to try it out on your codebase today!

For more information, see some of our notable optimizations:

- Migrate to Modules 

- `Node` Monomorphization 

- `Symbol` Monomorphization 

- `Identifier` Size Reduction 

- `Printer` Caching 

- Limited Usage of `var` 

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

### Runtime Requirements

TypeScript now targets ECMAScript 2018.
For Node users, that means a minimum version requirement of at least Node.js 10 and later.

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Changes to how types for the DOM are generated might have an impact on existing code.
Notably, certain properties have been converted from `number` to numeric literal types, and properties and methods for cut, copy, and paste event handling have been moved across interfaces.

### API Breaking Changes

In TypeScript 5.0, we moved to modules, removed some unnecessary interfaces, and made some correctness improvements.
For more details on what’s changed, see our API Breaking Changes page.

### Forbidden Implicit Coercions in Relational Operators

Certain operations in TypeScript will already warn you if you write code which may cause an implicit string-to-number coercion:



```id
tsfunction func(ns: number | string) {  return ns * 4; // Error, possible implicit coercion}
```



In 5.0, this will also be applied to the relational operators `>`, ` =`:



```id
tsfunction func(ns: number | string) {  return ns > 4; // Now also an error}
```



To allow this if desired, you can explicitly coerce the operand to a `number` using `+`:



```id
tsfunction func(ns: number | string) {  return +ns > 4; // OK}
```



This correctness improvement was contributed courtesy of Mateusz Burzyński .

### Enum Overhaul

TypeScript has had some long-standing oddities around `enum`s ever since its first release.
In 5.0, we’re cleaning up some of these problems, as well as reducing the concept count needed to understand the various kinds of `enum`s you can declare.

There are two main new errors you might see as part of this.
The first is that assigning an out-of-domain literal to an `enum` type will now error as one might expect:



```id
tsenum SomeEvenDigit {    Zero = 0,    Two = 2,    Four = 4}// Now correctly an errorlet m: SomeEvenDigit = 1;
```



The other is that declaration of certain kinds of indirected mixed string/number `enum` forms would, incorrectly, create an all-number `enum`:



```id
tsenum Letters {    A = "a"}enum Numbers {    one = 1,    two = Letters.A}// Now correctly an errorconst t: number = Numbers.two;
```



You can see more details in relevant change .

### More Accurate Type-Checking for Parameter Decorators in Constructors Under `--experimentalDecorators`

TypeScript 5.0 makes type-checking more accurate for decorators under `--experimentalDecorators`.
One place where this becomes apparent is when using a decorator on a constructor parameter.



```id
tsexport declare const inject:  (entity: any) =>    (target: object, key: string | symbol, index?: number) => void;export class Foo {}export class C {    constructor(@inject(Foo) private x: any) {    }}
```



This call will fail because `key` expects a `string | symbol`, but constructor parameters receive a key of `undefined`.
The correct fix is to change the type of `key` within `inject`.
A reasonable workaround if you’re using a library that can’t be upgraded is is to wrap `inject` in a more type-safe decorator function, and use a type-assertion on `key`.

For more details, see this issue .

### Deprecations and Default Changes

In TypeScript 5.0, we’ve deprecated the following settings and setting values:

- `--target: ES3`

- `--out`

- `--noImplicitUseStrict`

- `--keyofStringsOnly`

- `--suppressExcessPropertyErrors`

- `--suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors`

- `--noStrictGenericChecks`

- `--charset`

- `--importsNotUsedAsValues`

- `--preserveValueImports`

- `prepend` in project references

These configurations will continue to be allowed until TypeScript 5.5, at which point they will be removed entirely, however, you will receive a warning if you are using these settings.
In TypeScript 5.0, as well as future releases 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, you can specify `"ignoreDeprecations": "5.0"` to silence those warnings.
We’ll also shortly be releasing a 4.9 patch to allow specifying `ignoreDeprecations` to allow for smoother upgrades.
Aside from deprecations, we’ve changed some settings to better improve cross-platform behavior in TypeScript.

`--newLine`, which controls the line endings emitted in JavaScript files, used to be inferred based on the current operating system if not specified.
We think builds should be as deterministic as possible, and Windows Notepad supports line-feed line endings now, so the new default setting is `LF`.
The old OS-specific inference behavior is no longer available.

`--forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`, which ensured that all references to the same file name in a project agreed in casing, now defaults to `true`.
This can help catch differences issues with code written on case-insensitive file systems.

You can leave feedback and view more information on the tracking issue for 5.0 deprecations

# TypeScript 4.9

 

## The `satisfies` Operator

TypeScript developers are often faced with a dilemma: we want to ensure that some expression matches some type, but also want to keep the most specific type of that expression for inference purposes.

For example:



```id
ts// Each property can be a string or an RGB tuple.const palette = {    red: [255, 0, 0],    green: "#00ff00",    bleu: [0, 0, 255]//  ^^^^ sacrebleu - we've made a typo!};// We want to be able to use string methods on 'green'...const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```



Notice that we’ve written `bleu`, whereas we probably should have written `blue`.
We could try to catch that `bleu` typo by using a type annotation on `palette`, but we’d lose the information about each property.



```id
tstype Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];const palette: Record<Colors, string | RGB> = {    red: [255, 0, 0],    green: "#00ff00",    bleu: [0, 0, 255]//  ~~~~ The typo is now correctly detected};// But we now have an undesirable error here - 'palette.green' "could" be of type RGB and// property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | RGB'.const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```



The new `satisfies` operator lets us validate that the type of an expression matches some type, without changing the resulting type of that expression.
As an example, we could use `satisfies` to validate that all the properties of `palette` are compatible with `string | number[]`:



```id
tstype Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";type RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];const palette = {    red: [255, 0, 0],    green: "#00ff00",    bleu: [0, 0, 255]//  ~~~~ The typo is now caught!} satisfies Record<Colors, string | RGB>;// toUpperCase() method is still accessible!const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```



`satisfies` can be used to catch lots of possible errors.
For example, we could ensure that an object has all the keys of some type, but no more:



```id
tstype Colors = "red" | "green" | "blue";// Ensure that we have exactly the keys from 'Colors'.const favoriteColors = {    "red": "yes",    "green": false,    "blue": "kinda",    "platypus": false//  ~~~~~~~~~~ error - "platypus" was never listed in 'Colors'.} satisfies Record<Colors, unknown>;// All the information about the 'red', 'green', and 'blue' properties are retained.const g: boolean = favoriteColors.green;
```



Maybe we don’t care about if the property names match up somehow, but we do care about the types of each property.
In that case, we can also ensure that all of an object’s property values conform to some type.



```id
tstype RGB = [red: number, green: number, blue: number];const palette = {    red: [255, 0, 0],    green: "#00ff00",    blue: [0, 0]    //    ~~~~~~ error!} satisfies Record<string, string | RGB>;// Information about each property is still maintained.const redComponent = palette.red.at(0);const greenNormalized = palette.green.toUpperCase();
```



For more examples, you can see the issue proposing this and the implementing pull request .
We’d like to thank Oleksandr Tarasiuk who implemented and iterated on this feature with us.

## Unlisted Property Narrowing with the `in` Operator

As developers, we often need to deal with values that aren’t fully known at runtime.
In fact, we often don’t know if properties exist, whether we’re getting a response from a server or reading a configuration file.
JavaScript’s `in` operator can check whether a property
exists on an object.

Previously, TypeScript allowed us to narrow away any types that don’t explicitly list a property.



```id
tsinterface RGB {    red: number;    green: number;    blue: number;}interface HSV {    hue: number;    saturation: number;    value: number;}function setColor(color: RGB | HSV) {    if ("hue" in color) {        // 'color' now has the type HSV    }    // ...}
```



Here, the type `RGB` didn’t list the `hue` and got narrowed away, and leaving us with the type `HSV`.

But what about examples where no type listed a given property?
In those cases, the language didn’t help us much.
Let’s take the following example in JavaScript:



```id
jsfunction tryGetPackageName(context) {    const packageJSON = context.packageJSON;    // Check to see if we have an object.    if (packageJSON && typeof packageJSON === "object") {        // Check to see if it has a string name property.        if ("name" in packageJSON && typeof packageJSON.name === "string") {            return packageJSON.name;        }    }    return undefined;}
```



Rewriting this to canonical TypeScript would just be a matter of defining and using a type for `context`;
however, picking a safe type like `unknown` for the `packageJSON` property would cause issues in older versions of TypeScript.



```id
tsinterface Context {    packageJSON: unknown;}function tryGetPackageName(context: Context) {    const packageJSON = context.packageJSON;    // Check to see if we have an object.    if (packageJSON && typeof packageJSON === "object") {        // Check to see if it has a string name property.        if ("name" in packageJSON && typeof packageJSON.name === "string") {        //                                              ~~~~        // error! Property 'name' does not exist on type 'object.            return packageJSON.name;        //                     ~~~~        // error! Property 'name' does not exist on type 'object.        }    }    return undefined;}
```



This is because while the type of `packageJSON` was narrowed from `unknown` to `object`, the `in` operator strictly narrowed to types that actually defined the property being checked.
As a result, the type of `packageJSON` remained `object`.

TypeScript 4.9 makes the `in` operator a little bit more powerful when narrowing types that don’t list the property at all.
Instead of leaving them as-is, the language will intersect their types with `Record `.

So in our example, `packageJSON` will have its type narrowed from `unknown` to `object` to `object & Record `
That allows us to access `packageJSON.name` directly and narrow that independently.



```id
tsinterface Context {    packageJSON: unknown;}function tryGetPackageName(context: Context): string | undefined {    const packageJSON = context.packageJSON;    // Check to see if we have an object.    if (packageJSON && typeof packageJSON === "object") {        // Check to see if it has a string name property.        if ("name" in packageJSON && typeof packageJSON.name === "string") {            // Just works!            return packageJSON.name;        }    }    return undefined;}
```



TypeScript 4.9 also tightens up a few checks around how `in` is used, ensuring that the left side is assignable to the type `string | number | symbol`, and the right side is assignable to `object`.
This helps check that we’re using valid property keys, and not accidentally checking primitives.

For more information, read the implementing pull request 

## Auto-Accessors in Classes

TypeScript 4.9 supports an upcoming feature in ECMAScript called auto-accessors.
Auto-accessors are declared just like properties on classes, except that they’re declared with the `accessor` keyword.



```id
tsclass Person {    accessor name: string;    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }}
```



Under the covers, these auto-accessors “de-sugar” to a `get` and `set` accessor with an unreachable private property.



```id
tsclass Person {    #__name: string;    get name() {        return this.#__name;    }    set name(value: string) {        this.#__name = value;    }    constructor(name: string) {        this.name = name;    }}
```



You can read up more about the auto-accessors pull request on the original PR .

## Checks For Equality on `NaN`

A major gotcha for JavaScript developers is checking against the value `NaN` using the built-in equality operators.

For some background, `NaN` is a special numeric value that stands for “Not a Number”.
Nothing is ever equal to `NaN` - even `NaN`!



```id
jsconsole.log(NaN == 0)  // falseconsole.log(NaN === 0) // falseconsole.log(NaN == NaN)  // falseconsole.log(NaN === NaN) // false
```



But at least symmetrically everything is always not-equal to `NaN`.



```id
jsconsole.log(NaN != 0)  // trueconsole.log(NaN !== 0) // trueconsole.log(NaN != NaN)  // trueconsole.log(NaN !== NaN) // true
```



This technically isn’t a JavaScript-specific problem, since any language that contains IEEE-754 floats has the same behavior;
but JavaScript’s primary numeric type is a floating point number, and number parsing in JavaScript can often result in `NaN`.
In turn, checking against `NaN` ends up being fairly common, and the correct way to do so is to use `Number.isNaN` - but as we mentioned, lots of people accidentally end up checking with `someValue === NaN` instead.

TypeScript now errors on direct comparisons against `NaN`, and will suggest using some variation of `Number.isNaN` instead.



```id
tsfunction validate(someValue: number) {    return someValue !== NaN;    //     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    // error: This condition will always return 'true'.    //        Did you mean '!Number.isNaN(someValue)'?}
```



We believe that this change should strictly help catch beginner errors, similar to how TypeScript currently issues errors on comparisons against object and array literals.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk who contributed this check .

## File-Watching Now Uses File System Events

In earlier versions, TypeScript leaned heavily on polling for watching individual files.
Using a polling strategy meant checking the state of a file periodically for updates.
On Node.js, `fs.watchFile` is the built-in way to get a polling file-watcher.
While polling tends to be more predictable across platforms and file systems, it means that your CPU has to periodically get interrupted and check for updates to the file, even when nothing’s changed.
For a few dozen files, this might not be noticeable;
but on a bigger project with lots of files - or lots of files in `node_modules` - this can become a resource hog.

Generally speaking, a better approach is to use file system events.
Instead of polling, we can announce that we’re interested in updates of specific files and provide a callback for when those files actually do change.
Most modern platforms in use provide facilities and APIs like `CreateIoCompletionPort`, `kqueue`, `epoll`, and `inotify`.
Node.js mostly abstracts these away by providing `fs.watch` .
File system events usually work great, but there are lots of caveats to using them, and in turn, to using the `fs.watch` API.
A watcher needs to be careful to consider inode watching , unavailability on certain file systems (e.g.networked file systems), whether recursive file watching is available, whether directory renames trigger events, and even file watcher exhaustion!
In other words, it’s not quite a free lunch, especially if you’re looking for something cross-platform.

As a result, our default was to pick the lowest common denominator: polling.
Not always, but most of the time.

Over time, we’ve provided the means to choose other file-watching strategies .
This allowed us to get feedback and harden our file-watching implementation against most of these platform-specific gotchas.
As TypeScript has needed to scale to larger codebases, and has improved in this area, we felt swapping to file system events as the default would be a worthwhile investment.

In TypeScript 4.9, file watching is powered by file system events by default, only falling back to polling if we fail to set up event-based watchers.
For most developers, this should provide a much less resource-intensive experience when running in `--watch` mode, or running with a TypeScript-powered editor like Visual Studio or VS Code.

 The way file-watching works can still be configured through environment variables and `watchOptions` - and some editors like VS Code can support `watchOptions` independently .
Developers using more exotic set-ups where source code resides on a networked file systems (like NFS and SMB) may need to opt back into the older behavior; though if a server has reasonable processing power, it might just be better to enable SSH and run TypeScript remotely so that it has direct local file access.
VS Code has plenty of remote extensions to make this easier.

You can read up more on this change on GitHub .

## “Remove Unused Imports” and “Sort Imports” Commands for Editors

Previously, TypeScript only supported two editor commands to manage imports.
For our examples, take the following code:



```id
tsimport { Zebra, Moose, HoneyBadger } from "./zoo";import { foo, bar } from "./helper";let x: Moose | HoneyBadger = foo();
```



The first was called “Organize Imports” which would remove unused imports, and then sort the remaining ones.
It would rewrite that file to look like this one:



```id
tsimport { foo } from "./helper";import { HoneyBadger, Moose } from "./zoo";let x: Moose | HoneyBadger = foo();
```



In TypeScript 4.3, we introduced a command called “Sort Imports” which would only sort imports in the file, but not remove them - and would rewrite the file like this.



```id
tsimport { bar, foo } from "./helper";import { HoneyBadger, Moose, Zebra } from "./zoo";let x: Moose | HoneyBadger = foo();
```



The caveat with “Sort Imports” was that in Visual Studio Code, this feature was only available as an on-save command - not as a manually triggerable command.

TypeScript 4.9 adds the other half, and now provides “Remove Unused Imports”.
TypeScript will now remove unused import names and statements, but will otherwise leave the relative ordering alone.



```id
tsimport { Moose, HoneyBadger } from "./zoo";import { foo } from "./helper";let x: Moose | HoneyBadger = foo();
```



This feature is available to all editors that wish to use either command;
but notably, Visual Studio Code (1.73 and later) will have support built in and will surface these commands via its Command Palette.
Users who prefer to use the more granular “Remove Unused Imports” or “Sort Imports” commands should be able to reassign the “Organize Imports” key combination to them if desired.

You can view specifics of the feature here .

## Go-to-Definition on `return` Keywords

In the editor, when running a go-to-definition on the `return` keyword, TypeScript will now jump you to the top of the corresponding function.
This can be helpful to get a quick sense of which function a `return` belongs to.

We expect TypeScript will expand this functionality to more keywords such as `await` and `yield` or `switch`, `case`, and `default` .

 This feature was implemented thanks to Oleksandr Tarasiuk .

## Performance Improvements

TypeScript has a few small, but notable, performance improvements.

First, TypeScript’s `forEachChild` function has been rewritten to use a function table lookup instead of a `switch` statement across all syntax nodes.
`forEachChild` is a workhorse for traversing syntax nodes in the compiler, and is used heavily in the binding stage of our compiler, along with parts of the language service.
The refactoring of `forEachChild` yielded up to a 20% reduction of time spent in our binding phase and across language service operations.

Once we discovered this performance win for `forEachChild`, we tried it out on `visitEachChild`, a function we use for transforming nodes in the compiler and language service.
The same refactoring yielded up to a 3% reduction in time spent in generating project output.

The initial exploration in `forEachChild` was inspired by a blog post by Artemis Everfree .
While we have some reason to believe the root cause of our speed-up might have more to do with function size/complexity than the issues described in the blog post, we’re grateful that we were able to learn from the experience and try out a relatively quick refactoring that made TypeScript faster.

Finally, the way TypeScript preserves the information about a type in the true branch of a conditional type has been optimized.
In a type like



```id
tsinterface Zoo<T extends Animal> {    // ...}type MakeZoo<A> = A extends Animal ? Zoo<A> : never;
```



TypeScript has to “remember” that `A` must also be an `Animal` when checking if `Zoo ` is valid.
This is basically done by creating a special type that used to hold the intersection of `A` with `Animal`;
however, TypeScript previously did this eagerly which isn’t always necessary.
Furthermore, some faulty code in our type-checker prevented these special types from being simplified.
TypeScript now defers intersecting these types until it’s necessary.
For codebases with heavy use of conditional types, you might witness significant speed-ups with TypeScript, but in our performance testing suite, we saw a more modest 3% reduction in type-checking time.

You can read up more on these optimizations on their respective pull requests:

 `forEachChild` as a jump-table 

- `visitEachChild` as a jump-table 

- Optimize substitition types 

## Correctness Fixes and Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Updates

While TypeScript strives to avoid major breaks, even small changes in the built-in libraries can cause issues.
We don’t expect major breaks as a result of DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates, but there may be some small ones.

### Better Types for `Promise.resolve`

`Promise.resolve` now uses the `Awaited` type to unwrap Promise-like types passed to it.
This means that it more often returns the right `Promise` type, but that improved type can break existing code if it was expecting `any` or `unknown` instead of a `Promise`.
For more information, see the original change .

### JavaScript Emit No Longer Elides Imports

When TypeScript first supported type-checking and compilation for JavaScript, it accidentally supported a feature called import elision.
In short, if an import is not used as a value, or the compiler can detect that the import doesn’t refer to a value at runtime, the compiler will drop the import during emit.

This behavior was questionable, especially the detection of whether the import doesn’t refer to a value, since it means that TypeScript has to trust sometimes-inaccurate declaration files.
In turn, TypeScript now preserves imports in JavaScript files.



```id
js// Input:import { someValue, SomeClass } from "some-module";/** @type {SomeClass} */let val = someValue;// Previous Output:import { someValue } from "some-module";/** @type {SomeClass} */let val = someValue;// Current Output:import { someValue, SomeClass } from "some-module";/** @type {SomeClass} */let val = someValue;
```



More information is available at the implementing change .

### `exports` is Prioritized Over `typesVersions`

Previously, TypeScript incorrectly prioritized the `typesVersions` field over the `exports` field when resolving through a `package.json` under `--moduleResolution node16`.
If this change impacts your library, you may need to add `types@` version selectors in your `package.json`’s `exports` field.



```id
diff  {      "type": "module",      "main": "./dist/main.js"      "typesVersions": {          "<4.8": { ".": ["4.8-types/main.d.ts"] },          "*": { ".": ["modern-types/main.d.ts"] }      },      "exports": {          ".": {+             "types@<4.8": "./4.8-types/main.d.ts",+             "types": "./modern-types/main.d.ts",              "import": "./dist/main.js"          }      }  }
```



For more information, see this pull request .

## `substitute` Replaced With `constraint` on `SubstitutionType`s

As part of an optimization on substitution types, `SubstitutionType` objects no longer contain the `substitute` property representing the effective substitution (usually an intersection of the base type and the implicit constraint) - instead, they just contain the `constraint` property.

For more details, read more on the original pull request .

# TypeScript 4.2

 

## Smarter Type Alias Preservation

TypeScript has a way to declare new names for types called type aliases.
If you’re writing a set of functions that all work on `string | number | boolean`, you can write a type alias to avoid repeating yourself over and over again.



```id
tstype BasicPrimitive = number | string | boolean;
```



TypeScript has always used a set of rules and guesses for when to reuse type aliases when printing out types.
For example, take the following code snippet.



```id
tsexport type BasicPrimitive = number | string | boolean;export function doStuff(value: BasicPrimitive) {  let x = value;  return x;}
```



If we hover our mouse over `x` in an editor like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the TypeScript Playground , we’ll get a quick info panel that shows the type `BasicPrimitive`.
Likewise, if we get the declaration file output (`.d.ts` output) for this file, TypeScript will say that `doStuff` returns `BasicPrimitive`.

However, what happens if we return a `BasicPrimitive` or `undefined`?



```id
tsexport type BasicPrimitive = number | string | boolean;export function doStuff(value: BasicPrimitive) {  if (Math.random() < 0.5) {    return undefined;  }  return value;}
```



We can see what happens in the TypeScript 4.1 playground .
While we might want TypeScript to display the return type of `doStuff` as `BasicPrimitive | undefined`, it instead displays `string | number | boolean | undefined`!
What gives?

Well this has to do with how TypeScript represents types internally.
When creating a union type out of one or more union types, it will always normalize those types into a new flattened union type - but doing that loses information.
The type-checker would have to find every combination of types from `string | number | boolean | undefined` to see what type aliases could have been used, and even then, there might be multiple type aliases to `string | number | boolean`.

In TypeScript 4.2, our internals are a little smarter.
We keep track of how types were constructed by keeping around parts of how they were originally written and constructed over time.
We also keep track of, and differentiate, type aliases to instances of other aliases!

Being able to print back the types based on how you used them in your code means that as a TypeScript user, you can avoid some unfortunately humongous types getting displayed, and that often translates to getting better `.d.ts` file output, error messages, and in-editor type displays in quick info and signature help.
This can help TypeScript feel a little bit more approachable for newcomers.

For more information, check out the first pull request that improves various cases around preserving union type aliases , along with a second pull request that preserves indirect aliases .

## Leading/Middle Rest Elements in Tuple Types

In TypeScript, tuple types are meant to model arrays with specific lengths and element types.



```id
ts// A tuple that stores a pair of numberslet a: [number, number] = [1, 2];// A tuple that stores a string, a number, and a booleanlet b: [string, number, boolean] = ["hello", 42, true];
```



Over time, TypeScript’s tuple types have become more and more sophisticated, since they’re also used to model things like parameter lists in JavaScript.
As a result, they can have optional elements and rest elements, and can even have labels for tooling and readability.



```id
ts// A tuple that has either one or two strings.let c: [string, string?] = ["hello"];c = ["hello", "world"]; // A labeled tuple that has either one or two strings.let d: [first: string, second?: string] = ["hello"];d = ["hello", "world"]; // A tuple with a *rest element* - holds at least 2 strings at the front,// and any number of booleans at the back.let e: [string, string, ...boolean[]]; e = ["hello", "world"];e = ["hello", "world", false];e = ["hello", "world", true, false, true];Try
```



In TypeScript 4.2, rest elements specifically been expanded in how they can be used.
In prior versions, TypeScript only allowed `...rest` elements at the very last position of a tuple type.

However, now rest elements can occur anywhere within a tuple - with only a few restrictions.



```id
tslet foo: [...string[], number]; foo = [123];foo = ["hello", 123];foo = ["hello!", "hello!", "hello!", 123]; let bar: [boolean, ...string[], boolean]; bar = [true, false];bar = [true, "some text", false];bar = [true, "some", "separated", "text", false];Try
```



The only restriction is that a rest element can be placed anywhere in a tuple, so long as it’s not followed by another optional element or rest element.
In other words, only one rest element per tuple, and no optional elements after rest elements.



```id
tsinterface Clown {  /*...*/}interface Joker {  /*...*/} let StealersWheel: [...Clown[], "me", ...Joker[]];A rest element cannot follow another rest element.1265A rest element cannot follow another rest element. let StringsAndMaybeBoolean: [...string[], boolean?];An optional element cannot follow a rest element.1266An optional element cannot follow a rest element.Try
```



These non-trailing rest elements can be used to model functions that take any number of leading arguments, followed by a few fixed ones.



```id
tsdeclare function doStuff(...args: [...names: string[], shouldCapitalize: boolean]): void; doStuff(/*shouldCapitalize:*/ false)doStuff("fee", "fi", "fo", "fum", /*shouldCapitalize:*/ true);Try
```



Even though JavaScript doesn’t have any syntax to model leading rest parameters, we were still able to declare `doStuff` as a function that takes leading arguments by declaring the `...args` rest parameter with a tuple type that uses a leading rest element .
This can help model lots of existing JavaScript out there!

## Stricter Checks For The `in` Operator

In JavaScript, it is a runtime error to use a non-object type on the right side of the `in` operator.
TypeScript 4.2 ensures this can be caught at design-time.



```id
ts"foo" in 42;Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'object'.2322Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'object'.Try
```



This check is fairly conservative for the most part, so if you have received an error about this, it is likely an issue in the code.

A big thanks to our external contributor Jonas Hübotter for their pull request !

## `--noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`

Back when TypeScript first introduced index signatures, you could only get properties declared by them with “bracketed” element access syntax like `person["name"]`.



```id
tsinterface SomeType {  /** This is an index signature. */  [propName: string]: any;} function doStuff(value: SomeType) {  let x = value["someProperty"];}Try
```



This ended up being cumbersome in situations where we need to work with objects that have arbitrary properties.
For example, imagine an API where it’s common to misspell a property name by adding an extra `s` character at the end.



```id
tsinterface Options {  /** File patterns to be excluded. */  exclude?: string[];   /**   * It handles any extra properties that we haven&apos;t declared as type &apos;any&apos;.   */  [x: string]: any;} function processOptions(opts: Options) {  // Notice we&apos;re *intentionally* accessing `excludes`, not `exclude`  if (opts.excludes) {    console.error(      "The option `excludes` is not valid. Did you mean `exclude`?"    );  }}Try
```



To make these types of situations easier, a while back, TypeScript made it possible to use “dotted” property access syntax like `person.name` when a type had a string index signature.
This also made it easier to transition existing JavaScript code over to TypeScript.

However, loosening the restriction also meant that misspelling an explicitly declared property became much easier.



```id
tsfunction processOptions(opts: Options) {  // ...   // Notice we&apos;re *accidentally* accessing `excludes` this time.  // Oops! Totally valid.  for (const excludePattern of opts.excludes) {    // ...  }}Try
```



In some cases, users would prefer to explicitly opt into the index signature - they would prefer to get an error message when a dotted property access doesn’t correspond to a specific property declaration.

That’s why TypeScript introduces a new flag called `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` .
Under this mode, you’ll be opted in to TypeScript’s older behavior that issues an error.
This new setting is not under the `strict` family of flags, since we believe users will find it more useful on certain codebases than others.

You can understand this feature in more detail by reading up on the corresponding pull request .
We’d also like to extend a big thanks to Wenlu Wang who sent us this pull request!

## `abstract` Construct Signatures

TypeScript allows us to mark a class as abstract .
This tells TypeScript that the class is only meant to be extended from, and that certain members need to be filled in by any subclass to actually create an instance.



```id
tsabstract class Shape {  abstract getArea(): number;} new Shape();Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.2511Cannot create an instance of an abstract class. class Square extends Shape {  #sideLength: number;   constructor(sideLength: number) {    super();    this.#sideLength = sideLength;  }   getArea() {    return this.#sideLength ** 2;  }} // Works fine.new Square(42);Try
```



To make sure this restriction in `new`-ing up `abstract` classes is consistently applied, you can’t assign an `abstract` class to anything that expects a construct signature.



```id
tsinterface HasArea {  getArea(): number;} let  HasArea' >Ctor: new () => HasArea = Shape;Type 'typeof Shape' is not assignable to type 'new () => HasArea'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.2322Type 'typeof Shape' is not assignable to type 'new () => HasArea'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.Try
```



This does the right thing in case we intend to run code like `new Ctor`, but it’s overly-restrictive in case we want to write a subclass of `Ctor`.



```id
tsabstract class Shape {  abstract getArea(): number;} interface HasArea {  getArea(): number;} function  HasArea): typeof (Anonymous class)' >makeSubclassWithArea( HasArea' >Ctor: new () => HasArea) {  return class extends  HasArea' >Ctor {    getArea() {      return 42    }  };} let MyShape =  HasArea): typeof (Anonymous class)' >makeSubclassWithArea(Shape);Argument of type 'typeof Shape' is not assignable to parameter of type 'new () => HasArea'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.2345Argument of type 'typeof Shape' is not assignable to parameter of type 'new () => HasArea'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.Try
```



It also doesn’t work well with built-in helper types like `InstanceType`.



```id
tstype MyInstance =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >InstanceType<typeof Shape>;Try
```



That’s why TypeScript 4.2 allows you to specify an `abstract` modifier on constructor signatures.



```id
tsinterface HasArea {    getArea(): number;} // Works!let  HasArea' >Ctor: abstract new () => HasArea = Shape;Try
```



Adding the `abstract` modifier to a construct signature signals that you can pass in `abstract` constructors.
It doesn’t stop you from passing in other classes/constructor functions that are “concrete” - it really just signals that there’s no intent to run the constructor directly, so it’s safe to pass in either class type.

This feature allows us to write mixin factories in a way that supports abstract classes.
For example, in the following code snippet, we’re able to use the mixin function `withStyles` with the `abstract` class `SuperClass`.



```id
tsabstract class SuperClass {    abstract someMethod(): void;    badda() {}} type  = abstract new (...args: any[]) => T' >AbstractConstructor<' >T> = abstract new (...args: any[]) => ' >T function >(Ctor: T): ((abstract new (...args: any[]) => StyledClass) & {
    prototype: withStyles<any>.StyledClass;
}) & T' >withStyles<>(Ctor: T): ((abstract new (...args: any[]) => StyledClass) & {
    prototype: withStyles<any>.StyledClass;
}) & T' >T extends  = abstract new (...args: any[]) => T' >AbstractConstructor<object>>(' >Ctor: >(Ctor: T): ((abstract new (...args: any[]) => StyledClass) & {
    prototype: withStyles<any>.StyledClass;
}) & T' >T) {    abstract class StyledClass extends ' >Ctor {        getStyles() {            // ...        }    }    return StyledClass;} class SubClass extends (Ctor: typeof SuperClass): ((abstract new (...args: any[]) => withStyles<typeof SuperClass>.StyledClass) & {
    prototype: withStyles<any>.StyledClass;
}) & typeof SuperClass' >withStyles(SuperClass) {    someMethod() {        this.someMethod()    }}Try
```



Note that `withStyles` is demonstrating a specific rule, where a class (like `StyledClass`) that extends a value that’s generic and bounded by an abstract constructor (like `Ctor`) has to also be declared `abstract`.
This is because there’s no way to know if a class with more abstract members was passed in, and so it’s impossible to know whether the subclass implements all the abstract members.

You can read up more on abstract construct signatures on its pull request .

## Understanding Your Project Structure With `--explainFiles`

A surprisingly common scenario for TypeScript users is to ask “why is TypeScript including this file?“.
Inferring the files of your program turns out to be a complicated process, and so there are lots of reasons why a specific combination of `lib.d.ts` got used, why certain files in `node_modules` are getting included, and why certain files are being included even though we thought specifying `exclude` would keep them out.

That’s why TypeScript now provides an `explainFiles` flag.



```id
shtsc --explainFiles
```



When using this option, the TypeScript compiler will give some very verbose output about why a file ended up in your program.
To read it more easily, you can forward the output to a file, or pipe it to a program that can easily view it.



```id
sh# Forward output to a text filetsc --explainFiles > explanation.txt# Pipe output to a utility program like `less`, or an editor like VS Codetsc --explainFiles | lesstsc --explainFiles | code -
```



Typically, the output will start out by listing out reasons for including `lib.d.ts` files, then for local files, and then `node_modules` files.



```
TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es5.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es5' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2015.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2015.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2015' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2016.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2016.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2016' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2017.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2017.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2017' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2018.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2018.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2018' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2019.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2019.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2019' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2020.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2020.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2020' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.esnext.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.esnext.d.ts  Library 'lib.esnext.d.ts' specified in compilerOptions...

```



Right now, we make no guarantees about the output format - it might change over time.
On that note, we’re interested in improving this format if you have any suggestions!

## Improved Uncalled Function Checks in Logical Expressions

Thanks to further improvements from Alex Tarasyuk , TypeScript’s uncalled function checks now apply within `&&` and `||` expressions.

Under `strictNullChecks` , the following code will now error.



```id
tsfunction shouldDisplayElement(element: Element) {  // ...  return true;}function getVisibleItems(elements: Element[]) {  return elements.filter((e) => shouldDisplayElement && e.children.length);  //                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  // This condition will always return true since the function is always defined.  // Did you mean to call it instead.}
```



For more details, check out the pull request here .

## Destructured Variables Can Be Explicitly Marked as Unused

Thanks to another pull request from Alex Tarasyuk , you can now mark destructured variables as unused by prefixing them with an underscore (the `_` character).



```id
tslet [_first, second] = getValues();
```



Previously, if `_first` was never used later on, TypeScript would issue an error under `noUnusedLocals` .
Now, TypeScript will recognize that `_first` was intentionally named with an underscore because there was no intent to use it.

For more details, take a look at the full change .

## Relaxed Rules Between Optional Properties and String Index Signatures

String index signatures are a way of typing dictionary-like objects, where you want to allow access with arbitrary keys:



```id
tsconst movieWatchCount: { [key: string]: number } = {}; function watchMovie(title: string) {  movieWatchCount[title] = (movieWatchCount[title] ?? 0) + 1;}Try
```



Of course, for any movie title not yet in the dictionary, `movieWatchCount[title]` will be `undefined` (TypeScript 4.1 added the option `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to include `undefined` when reading from an index signature like this).
Even though it’s clear that there must be some strings not present in `movieWatchCount`, previous versions of TypeScript treated optional object properties as unassignable to otherwise compatible index signatures, due to the presence of `undefined`.



```id
tstype WesAndersonWatchCount = {  "Fantastic Mr. Fox"?: number;  "The Royal Tenenbaums"?: number;  "Moonrise Kingdom"?: number;  "The Grand Budapest Hotel"?: number;}; declare const wesAndersonWatchCount: WesAndersonWatchCount;const movieWatchCount: { [key: string]: number } = wesAndersonWatchCount;//    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ error!// Type &apos;WesAndersonWatchCount&apos; is not assignable to type &apos;{ [key: string]: number; }&apos;.//    Property &apos;"Fantastic Mr. Fox"&apos; is incompatible with index signature.//      Type &apos;number | undefined&apos; is not assignable to type &apos;number&apos;.//        Type &apos;undefined&apos; is not assignable to type &apos;number&apos;. (2322)Try
```



TypeScript 4.2 allows this assignment. However, it does not allow the assignment of non-optional properties with `undefined` in their types, nor does it allow writing `undefined` to a specific key:



```id
tstype BatmanWatchCount = {  "Batman Begins": number | undefined;  "The Dark Knight": number | undefined;  "The Dark Knight Rises": number | undefined;}; declare const batmanWatchCount: BatmanWatchCount; // Still an error in TypeScript 4.2.const movieWatchCount: { [key: string]: number } = batmanWatchCount;Type 'BatmanWatchCount' is not assignable to type '{ [key: string]: number; }'.
  Property '"Batman Begins"' is incompatible with index signature.
    Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'BatmanWatchCount' is not assignable to type '{ [key: string]: number; }'.
  Property '"Batman Begins"' is incompatible with index signature.
    Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'. // Still an error in TypeScript 4.2.// Index signatures don&apos;t implicitly allow explicit `undefined`.movieWatchCount["It&apos;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"] = undefined;Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.Try
```



The new rule also does not apply to number index signatures, since they are assumed to be array-like and dense:



```id
tsdeclare let sortOfArrayish: { [key: number]: string };declare let numberKeys: { 42?: string }; sortOfArrayish = numberKeys;Type '{ 42?: string | undefined; }' is not assignable to type '{ [key: number]: string; }'.
  Property '42' is incompatible with index signature.
    Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.2322Type '{ 42?: string | undefined; }' is not assignable to type '{ [key: number]: string; }'.
  Property '42' is incompatible with index signature.
    Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.Try
```



You can get a better sense of this change by reading up on the original PR .

## Declare Missing Helper Function

Thanks to a community pull request from Alexander Tarasyuk , we now have a quick fix for declaring new functions and methods based on the call-site!

 

## Breaking Changes

We always strive to minimize breaking changes in a release.
TypeScript 4.2 contains some breaking changes, but we believe they should be manageable in an upgrade.

### `lib.d.ts` Updates

As with every TypeScript version, declarations for `lib.d.ts` (especially the declarations generated for web contexts), have changed.
There are various changes, though `Intl` and `ResizeObserver`’s may end up being the most disruptive.

### `noImplicitAny` Errors Apply to Loose `yield` Expressions

When the value of a `yield` expression is captured, but TypeScript can’t immediately figure out what type you intend for it to receive (i.e. the `yield` expression isn’t contextually typed), TypeScript will now issue an implicit `any` error.



```id
tsfunction* ' >g1() {  const value = yield 1;'yield' expression implicitly results in an 'any' type because its containing generator lacks a return-type annotation.7057'yield' expression implicitly results in an 'any' type because its containing generator lacks a return-type annotation.} function* ' >g2() {  // No error.  // The result of `yield 1` is unused.  yield 1;} function* ' >g3() {  // No error.  // `yield 1` is contextually typed by &apos;string&apos;.  const value: string = yield 1;} function* ' >g4(): ' >Generator<number, void, string> {  // No error.  // TypeScript can figure out the type of `yield 1`  // from the explicit return type of `g4`.  const value = yield 1;}Try
```



See more details in the corresponding changes .

### Expanded Uncalled Function Checks

As described above, uncalled function checks will now operate consistently within `&&` and `||` expressions when using `strictNullChecks` .
This can be a source of new breaks, but is typically an indication of a logic error in existing code.

### Type Arguments in JavaScript Are Not Parsed as Type Arguments

Type arguments were already not allowed in JavaScript, but in TypeScript 4.2, the parser will parse them in a more spec-compliant way.
So when writing the following code in a JavaScript file:



```id
tsf<T>(100);
```



TypeScript will parse it as the following JavaScript:



```id
jsf < T > 100;
```



This may impact you if you were leveraging TypeScript’s API to parse type constructs in JavaScript files, which may have occurred when trying to parse Flow files.

See the pull request for more details on what’s checked.

### Tuple size limits for spreads

Tuple types can be made by using any sort of spread syntax (`...`) in TypeScript.



```id
ts// Tuple types with spread elementstype NumStr = [number, string];type NumStrNumStr = [...NumStr, ...NumStr];// Array spread expressionsconst numStr = [123, "hello"] as const;const numStrNumStr = [...numStr, ...numStr] as const;
```



Sometimes these tuple types can accidentally grow to be huge, and that can make type-checking take a long time.
Instead of letting the type-checking process hang (which is especially bad in editor scenarios), TypeScript has a limiter in place to avoid doing all that work.

You can see this pull request for more details.

### `.d.ts` Extensions Cannot Be Used In Import Paths

In TypeScript 4.2, it is now an error for your import paths to contain `.d.ts` in the extension.



```id
ts// must be changed to something like//   - "./foo"//   - "./foo.js"import { Foo } from "./foo.d.ts";
```



Instead, your import paths should reflect whatever your loader will do at runtime.
Any of the following imports might be usable instead.



```id
tsimport { Foo } from "./foo";import { Foo } from "./foo.js";import { Foo } from "./foo/index.js";
```



### Reverting Template Literal Inference

This change removed a feature from TypeScript 4.2 beta.
If you haven’t yet upgraded past our last stable release, you won’t be affected, but you may still be interested in the change.

The beta version of TypeScript 4.2 included a change in inference to template strings.
In this change, template string literals would either be given template string types or simplify to multiple string literal types.
These types would then widen to `string` when assigning to mutable variables.



```id
tsdeclare const yourName: string;// 'bar' is constant.// It has type '`hello ${string}`'.const bar = `hello ${yourName}`;// 'baz' is mutable.// It has type 'string'.let baz = `hello ${yourName}`;
```



This is similar to how string literal inference works.



```id
ts// 'bar' has type '"hello"'.const bar = "hello";// 'baz' has type 'string'.let baz = "hello";
```



For that reason, we believed that making template string expressions have template string types would be “consistent”;
however, from what we’ve seen and heard, that isn’t always desirable.

In response, we’ve reverted this feature (and potential breaking change).
If you do want a template string expression to be given a literal-like type, you can always add `as const` to the end of it.



```id
tsdeclare const yourName: string;// 'bar' has type '`hello ${string}`'.const bar = `hello ${yourName}` as const;//                              ^^^^^^^^// 'baz' has type 'string'.const baz = `hello ${yourName}`;
```



### TypeScript’s `lift` Callback in `visitNode` Uses a Different Type

TypeScript has a `visitNode` function that takes a `lift` function.
`lift` now expects a `readonly Node[]` instead of a `NodeArray `.
This is technically an API breaking change which you can read more on here .

# TypeScript 4.1

 

## Template Literal Types

String literal types in TypeScript allow us to model functions and APIs that expect a set of specific strings.



```id
tsfunction setVerticalAlignment(location: "top" | "middle" | "bottom") {  // ...} setVerticalAlignment("middel");Argument of type '"middel"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top" | "middle" | "bottom"'.2345Argument of type '"middel"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top" | "middle" | "bottom"'.Try
```



This is pretty nice because string literal types can basically spell-check our string values.

We also like that string literals can be used as property names in mapped types.
In this sense, they’re also usable as building blocks:



```id
tstype Options = {  [K in "noImplicitAny" | "strictNullChecks" | "strictFunctionTypes"]?: boolean;};// same as//   type Options = {//       noImplicitAny?: boolean,//       strictNullChecks?: boolean,//       strictFunctionTypes?: boolean//   };
```



But there’s another place that string literal types could be used as building blocks: building other string literal types.

That’s why TypeScript 4.1 brings the template literal string type.
It has the same syntax as template literal strings in JavaScript , but is used in type positions.
When you use it with concrete literal types, it produces a new string literal type by concatenating the contents.



```id
tstype World = "world"; type Greeting = `hello ${World}`;        type Greeting = "hello world"Try
```



What happens when you have unions in substitution positions?
It produces the set of every possible string literal that could be represented by each union member.



```id
tstype Color = "red" | "blue";type Quantity = "one" | "two"; type SeussFish = `${Quantity | Color} fish`;type SeussFish = "one fish" | "two fish" | "red fish" | "blue fish"Try
```



This can be used beyond cute examples in release notes.
For example, several libraries for UI components have a way to specify both vertical and horizontal alignment in their APIs, often with both at once using a single string like `"bottom-right"`.
Between vertically aligning with `"top"`, `"middle"`, and `"bottom"`, and horizontally aligning with `"left"`, `"center"`, and `"right"`, there are 9 possible strings where each of the former strings is connected with each of the latter strings using a dash.



```id
tstype VerticalAlignment = "top" | "middle" | "bottom";type HorizontalAlignment = "left" | "center" | "right"; // Takes//   | "top-left"    | "top-center"    | "top-right"//   | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right"//   | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right" declare function setAlignment(value: `${VerticalAlignment}-${HorizontalAlignment}`): void; setAlignment("top-left");   // works!setAlignment("top-middel"); // error!Argument of type '"top-middel"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"'.2345Argument of type '"top-middel"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"'.setAlignment("top-pot");    // error! but good doughnuts if you&apos;re ever in SeattleArgument of type '"top-pot"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"'.2345Argument of type '"top-pot"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"'.Try
```



While there are lots of examples of this sort of API in the wild, this is still a bit of a toy example since we could write these out manually.
In fact, for 9 strings, this is likely fine; but when you need a ton of strings, you should consider automatically generating them ahead of time to save work on every type-check (or just use `string`, which will be much simpler to comprehend).

Some of the real value comes from dynamically creating new string literals.
For example, imagine a `makeWatchedObject` API that takes an object and produces a mostly identical object, but with a new `on` method to detect for changes to the properties.



```id
tslet person = makeWatchedObject({  firstName: "Homer",  age: 42, // give-or-take  location: "Springfield",});person.on("firstNameChanged", () => {  console.log(`firstName was changed!`);});
```



Notice that `on` listens on the event `"firstNameChanged"`, not just `"firstName"`.
How would we type this?



```id
tstype PropEventSource<T> = {    on(eventName: `${string & keyof T}Changed`, callback: () => void): void;};/// Create a "watched object" with an 'on' method/// so that you can watch for changes to properties.declare function makeWatchedObject<T>(obj: T): T & PropEventSource<T>;
```



With this, we can build something that errors when we give the wrong property!



```id
ts// error!' >person. void): void' >on("firstName", () => {});Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "ageChanged" | "locationChanged"'.2345Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "ageChanged" | "locationChanged"'. // error!' >person. void): void' >on("frstNameChanged", () => {});Argument of type '"frstNameChanged"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "ageChanged" | "locationChanged"'.2345Argument of type '"frstNameChanged"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "ageChanged" | "locationChanged"'.Try
```



We can also do something special in template literal types: we can infer from substitution positions.
We can make our last example generic to infer from parts of the `eventName` string to figure out the associated property.



```id
tstype  = {

}' >PropEventSource<(obj: T): T & PropEventSource<T>' >T>; let ' >person = (obj: {
    firstName: string;
    age: number;
    location: string;
}): {
    firstName: string;
    age: number;
    location: string;
} & PropEventSource<{
    firstName: string;
    age: number;
    location: string;
}>' >makeWatchedObject({    firstName: "Homer",    age: 42,    location: "Springfield",}); // works! &apos;newName&apos; is typed as &apos;string&apos;' >person.(eventName: "firstNameChanged", callback: (newValue: string) => void): void' >on("firstNameChanged", newName => {    // &apos;newName&apos; has the type of &apos;firstName&apos;    console.log(`new name is ${newName.toUpperCase()}`);}); // works! &apos;newAge&apos; is typed as &apos;number&apos;' >person.(eventName: "ageChanged", callback: (newValue: number) => void): void' >on("ageChanged", newAge => {    if (newAge < 0) {        console.log("warning! negative age");    }})Try
```



Here we made `on` into a generic method.
When a user calls with the string `"firstNameChanged'`, TypeScript will try to infer the right type for `K`.
To do that, it will match `K` against the content prior to `"Changed"` and infer the string `"firstName"`.
Once TypeScript figures that out, the `on` method can fetch the type of `firstName` on the original object, which is `string` in this case.
Similarly, when we call with `"ageChanged"`, it finds the type for the property `age` which is `number`).

Inference can be combined in different ways, often to deconstruct strings, and reconstruct them in different ways.
In fact, to help with modifying these string literal types, we’ve added a few new utility type aliases for modifying casing in letters (i.e. converting to lowercase and uppercase characters).



```id
tstype  = `${Uppercase<T>}`' >EnthusiasticGreeting<' >T extends string> = `${ = intrinsic' >Uppercase<' >T>}` type HELLO =  = `${Uppercase<T>}`' >EnthusiasticGreeting<"hello">;      type HELLO = "HELLO"Try
```



The new type aliases are `Uppercase`, `Lowercase`, `Capitalize` and `Uncapitalize`.
The first two transform every character in a string, and the latter two transform only the first character in a string.

For more details, see the original pull request and the in-progress pull request to switch to type alias helpers .

## Key Remapping in Mapped Types

Just as a refresher, a mapped type can create new object types based on arbitrary keys



```id
tstype Options = {  [K in "noImplicitAny" | "strictNullChecks" | "strictFunctionTypes"]?: boolean;};// same as//   type Options = {//       noImplicitAny?: boolean,//       strictNullChecks?: boolean,//       strictFunctionTypes?: boolean//   };
```



or new object types based on other object types.



```id
ts/// 'Partial<T>' is the same as 'T', but with each property marked optional.type Partial<T> = {  [K in keyof T]?: T[K];};
```



Until now, mapped types could only produce new object types with keys that you provided them; however, lots of the time you want to be able to create new keys, or filter out keys, based on the inputs.

That’s why TypeScript 4.1 allows you to re-map keys in mapped types with a new `as` clause.



```id
tstype MappedTypeWithNewKeys<T> = {    [K in keyof T as NewKeyType]: T[K]    //            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^    //            This is the new syntax!}
```



With this new `as` clause, you can leverage features like template literal types to easily create property names based off of old ones.



```id
tstype  = { [K in keyof T as `get${Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => T[K]; }' >Getters<' >T> = {    [K in keyof ' >T as `get${ = intrinsic' >Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => ' >T[K]}; interface Person {    name: string;    age: number;    location: string;} type  string;
    getAge: () => number;
    getLocation: () => string;
}' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>LazyPerson =  = { [K in keyof T as `get${Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => T[K]; }' >Getters<Person>;         type LazyPerson = {
    getName: () => string;
    getAge: () => number;
    getLocation: () => string;
}Try
```



and you can even filter out keys by producing `never`.
That means you don’t have to use an extra `Omit` helper type in some cases.



```id
ts// Remove the &apos;kind&apos; propertytype  = { [K in keyof T as Exclude<K, "kind">]: T[K]; }' >RemoveKindField<' >T> = {    [K in keyof ' >T as  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<K, "kind">]: ' >T[K]}; interface Circle {    kind: "circle";    radius: number;} type KindlessCircle =  = { [K in keyof T as Exclude<K, "kind">]: T[K]; }' >RemoveKindField<Circle>;           type KindlessCircle = {
    radius: number;
}Try
```

## Recursive Conditional Types

In JavaScript it’s fairly common to see functions that can flatten and build up container types at arbitrary levels.
For example, consider the `.then()` method on instances of `Promise`.
`.then(...)` unwraps each promise until it finds a value that’s not “promise-like”, and passes that value to a callback.
There’s also a relatively new `flat` method on `Array`s that can take a depth of how deep to flatten.

Expressing this in TypeScript’s type system was, for all practical intents and purposes, not possible.
While there were hacks to achieve this, the types ended up looking very unreasonable.

That’s why TypeScript 4.1 eases some restrictions on conditional types - so that they can model these patterns.
In TypeScript 4.1, conditional types can now immediately reference themselves within their branches, making it easier to write recursive type aliases.

For example, if we wanted to write a type to get the element types of nested arrays, we could write the following `deepFlatten` type.



```id
tstype ElementType<T> = T extends ReadonlyArray<infer U> ? ElementType<U> : T;function deepFlatten<T extends readonly unknown[]>(x: T): ElementType<T>[] {  throw "not implemented";}// All of these return the type 'number[]':deepFlatten([1, 2, 3]);deepFlatten([[1], [2, 3]]);deepFlatten([[1], [[2]], [[[3]]]]);
```



Similarly, in TypeScript 4.1 we can write an `Awaited` type to deeply unwrap `Promise`s.



```id
tstype Awaited<T> = T extends PromiseLike<infer U> ? Awaited<U> : T;/// Like `promise.then(...)`, but more accurate in types.declare function customThen<T, U>(  p: Promise<T>,  onFulfilled: (value: Awaited<T>) => U): Promise<Awaited<U>>;
```



Keep in mind that while these recursive types are powerful, they should be used responsibly and sparingly.

First off, these types can do a lot of work which means that they can increase type-checking time.
Trying to model numbers in the Collatz conjecture or Fibonacci sequence might be fun, but don’t ship that in `.d.ts` files on npm.

But apart from being computationally intensive, these types can hit an internal recursion depth limit on sufficiently-complex inputs.
When that recursion limit is hit, that results in a compile-time error.
In general, it’s better not to use these types at all than to write something that fails on more realistic examples.

See more at the implementation .

## Checked Indexed Accesses (`--noUncheckedIndexedAccess`)

TypeScript has a feature called index signatures .
These signatures are a way to signal to the type system that users can access arbitrarily-named properties.



```id
tsinterface Options {  path: string;  permissions: number;   // Extra properties are caught by this index signature.  [propName: string]: string | number;} function checkOptions(opts: Options) {  opts.path; // string  opts.permissions; // number   // These are all allowed too!  // They have the type &apos;string | number&apos;.  opts.yadda.toString();  opts["foo bar baz"].toString();  opts[Math.random()].toString();}Try
```



In the above example, `Options` has an index signature that says any accessed property that’s not already listed should have the type `string | number`.
This is often convenient for optimistic code that assumes you know what you’re doing, but the truth is that most values in JavaScript do not support every potential property name.
Most types will not, for example, have a value for a property key created by `Math.random()` like in the previous example.
For many users, this behavior was undesirable, and felt like it wasn’t leveraging the full strict-checking of `strictNullChecks` .

That’s why TypeScript 4.1 ships with a new flag called `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` .
Under this new mode, every property access (like `foo.bar`) or indexed access (like `foo["bar"]`) is considered potentially undefined.
That means that in our last example, `opts.yadda` will have the type `string | number | undefined` as opposed to just `string | number`.
If you need to access that property, you’ll either have to check for its existence first or use a non-null assertion operator (the postfix `!` character).



```id
tsfunction checkOptions(opts: Options) {  opts.path; // string  opts.permissions; // number   // These are not allowed with noUncheckedIndexedAccess  opts.yadda.toString();'opts.yadda' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'opts.yadda' is possibly 'undefined'.  opts["foo bar baz"].toString();Object is possibly 'undefined'.2532Object is possibly 'undefined'.  opts[Math.random()].toString();Object is possibly 'undefined'.2532Object is possibly 'undefined'.   // Checking if it&apos;s really there first.  if (opts.yadda) {    console.log(opts.yadda.toString());  }   // Basically saying "trust me I know what I&apos;m doing"  // with the &apos;!&apos; non-null assertion operator.  opts.yadda!.toString();}Try
```



One consequence of using `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is that indexing into an array is also more strictly checked, even in a bounds-checked loop.



```id
tsfunction screamLines(strs: string[]) {  // This will have issues  for (let i = 0; i < strs..length: number' >length; i++) {    console.log(strs[i].toUpperCase());Object is possibly 'undefined'.2532Object is possibly 'undefined'.  }}Try
```



If you don’t need the indexes, you can iterate over individual elements by using a `for`-`of` loop or a `forEach` call.



```id
tsfunction screamLines(strs: string[]) {  // This works fine  for (const str of strs) {    console.log(str.toUpperCase());  }   // This works fine  strs..forEach(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((str) => {    console.log(str.toUpperCase());  });}Try
```



This flag can be handy for catching out-of-bounds errors, but it might be noisy for a lot of code, so it is not automatically enabled by the `strict` flag; however, if this feature is interesting to you, you should feel free to try it and determine whether it makes sense for your team’s codebase!

You can learn more at the implementing pull request .

## `paths` without `baseUrl`

Using path-mapping is fairly common - often it’s to have nicer imports, often it’s to simulate monorepo linking behavior.

Unfortunately, specifying `paths` to enable path-mapping required also specifying an option called `baseUrl` , which allows bare specifier paths to be reached relative to the `baseUrl` too.
This also often caused poor paths to be used by auto-imports.

In TypeScript 4.1, the `paths` option can be used without `baseUrl` .
This helps avoid some of these issues.

## `checkJs` Implies `allowJs`

Previously if you were starting a checked JavaScript project, you had to set both `allowJs` and `checkJs` .
This was a slightly annoying bit of friction in the experience, so `checkJs` now implies `allowJs` by default.

 See more details at the pull request .

## React 17 JSX Factories

TypeScript 4.1 supports React 17’s upcoming `jsx` and `jsxs` factory functions through two new options for the `jsx` compiler option:

 `react-jsx`

- `react-jsxdev`

These options are intended for production and development compiles respectively.
Often, the options from one can extend from the other.
For example, a `tsconfig.json` for production builds might look like the following:



```
// ./src/tsconfig.json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "esnext",    "target": "es2015",    "jsx": "react-jsx",    "strict": true  },  "include": ["./**/*"]}
```



and one for development builds might look like the following:



```
// ./src/tsconfig.dev.json{  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",  "compilerOptions": {    "jsx": "react-jsxdev"  }}
```



For more information, check out the corresponding PR .

## Editor Support for the JSDoc `@see` Tag

The JSDoc tag `@see` tag now has better support in editors for TypeScript and JavaScript.
This allows you to use functionality like go-to-definition in a dotted name following the tag.
For example, going to definition on `first` or `C` in the JSDoc comment just works in the following example:



```id
ts// @filename: first.tsexport class C {}// @filename: main.tsimport * as first from "./first";/** * @see first.C */function related() {}
```



Thanks to frequent contributor Wenlu Wang for implementing this !

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

`lib.d.ts` may have a set of changed APIs, potentially in part due to how the DOM types are automatically generated.
One specific change is that `Reflect.enumerate` has been removed, as it was removed from ES2016.

### `abstract` Members Can’t Be Marked `async`

Members marked as `abstract` can no longer be marked as `async`.
The fix here is to remove the `async` keyword, since callers are only concerned with the return type.

### `any`/`unknown` Are Propagated in Falsy Positions

Previously, for an expression like `foo && somethingElse`, the type of `foo` was `any` or `unknown`, the type of the whole that expression would be the type of `somethingElse`.

For example, previously the type for `x` here was `{ someProp: string }`.



```id
tsdeclare let foo: unknown;declare let somethingElse: { someProp: string };let x = foo && somethingElse;
```



However, in TypeScript 4.1, we are more careful about how we determine this type.
Since nothing is known about the type on the left side of the `&&`, we propagate `any` and `unknown` outward instead of the type on the right side.

The most common pattern we saw of this tended to be when checking compatibility with `boolean`s, especially in predicate functions.



```id
tsfunction isThing(x: any): boolean {  return x && typeof x === "object" && x.blah === "foo";}
```



Often the appropriate fix is to switch from `foo && someExpression` to `!!foo && someExpression`.

### `resolve`’s Parameters Are No Longer Optional in `Promise`s

When writing code like the following



```id
tsnew Promise((resolve) => {  doSomethingAsync(() => {    doSomething();    resolve();  });});
```



You may get an error like the following:



```
  resolve()  ~~~~~~~~~error TS2554: Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.  An argument for 'value' was not provided.
```



This is because `resolve` no longer has an optional parameter, so by default, it must now be passed a value.
Often this catches legitimate bugs with using `Promise`s.
The typical fix is to pass it the correct argument, and sometimes to add an explicit type argument.



```id
tsnew Promise<number>((resolve) => {  //     ^^^^^^^^  doSomethingAsync((value) => {    doSomething();    resolve(value);    //      ^^^^^  });});
```



However, sometimes `resolve()` really does need to be called without an argument.
In these cases, we can give `Promise` an explicit `void` generic type argument (i.e. write it out as `Promise `).
This leverages new functionality in TypeScript 4.1 where a potentially-`void` trailing parameter can become optional.



```id
tsnew Promise<void>((resolve) => {  //     ^^^^^^  doSomethingAsync(() => {    doSomething();    resolve();  });});
```



TypeScript 4.1 ships with a quick fix to help fix this break.

### Conditional Spreads Create Optional Properties

In JavaScript, object spreads (like `{ ...foo }`) don’t operate over falsy values.
So in code like `{ ...foo }`, `foo` will be skipped over if it’s `null` or `undefined`.

Many users take advantage of this to spread properties “conditionally”.



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age: number;  location: string;}interface Animal {  name: string;  owner: Person;}function copyOwner(pet?: Animal) {  return {    ...(pet && pet.owner),    otherStuff: 123,  };}// We could also use optional chaining here:function copyOwner(pet?: Animal) {  return {    ...pet?.owner,    otherStuff: 123,  };}
```



Here, if `pet` is defined, the properties of `pet.owner` will be spread in - otherwise, no properties will be spread into the returned object.

The return type of `copyOwner` was previously a union type based on each spread:



```
{ x: number } | { x: number, name: string, age: number, location: string }
```



This modeled exactly how the operation would occur: if `pet` was defined, all the properties from `Person` would be present; otherwise, none of them would be defined on the result.
It was an all-or-nothing operation.

However, we’ve seen this pattern taken to the extreme, with hundreds of spreads in a single object, each spread potentially adding in hundreds or thousands of properties.
It turns out that for various reasons, this ends up being extremely expensive, and usually for not much benefit.

In TypeScript 4.1, the returned type sometimes uses all-optional properties.



```
{    x: number;    name?: string;    age?: number;    location?: string;}
```



This ends up performing better and generally displaying better too.

For more details, see the original change .
While this behavior is not entirely consistent right now, we expect a future release will produce cleaner and more predictable results.

### Unmatched parameters are no longer related

TypeScript would previously relate parameters that didn’t correspond to each other by relating them to the type `any`.
With changes in TypeScript 4.1 , the language now skips this process entirely.
This means that some cases of assignability will now fail, but it also means that some cases of overload resolution can fail as well.
For example, overload resolution on `util.promisify` in Node.js may select a different overload in TypeScript 4.1, sometimes causing new or different errors downstream.

As a workaround, you may be best using a type assertion to squelch errors.

# TypeScript 4.8

 

## Improved Intersection Reduction, Union Compatibility, and Narrowing

TypeScript 4.8 brings a series of correctness and consistency improvements under `--strictNullChecks`.
These changes affect how intersection and union types work, and are leveraged in how TypeScript narrows types.

For example, `unknown` is close in spirit to the union type `{} | null | undefined` because it accepts `null`, `undefined`, and any other type.
TypeScript now recognizes this, and allows assignments from `unknown` to `{} | null | undefined`.



```id
tsfunction f(x: unknown, y: {} | null | undefined) {    x = y; // always worked    y = x; // used to error, now works}
```



Another change is that `{}` intersected with any other object type simplifies right down to that object type.
That meant that we were able to rewrite `NonNullable` to just use an intersection with `{}`, because `{} & null` and `{} & undefined` just get tossed away.



```id
diff- type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;+ type NonNullable<T> = T & {};
```



This is an improvement because intersection types like this can be reduced and assigned to, while conditional types currently cannot.
So `NonNullable >` now simplifies at least to `NonNullable `, whereas it didn’t before.



```id
tsfunction foo<T>(x: NonNullable<T>, y: NonNullable<NonNullable<T>>) {    x = y; // always worked    y = x; // used to error, now works}
```



These changes also allowed us to bring in sensible improvements in control flow analysis and type narrowing.
For example, `unknown` is now narrowed just like `{} | null | undefined` in truthy branches.



```id
tsfunction narrowUnknownishUnion(x: {} | null | undefined) {    if (x) {        x;  // {}    }    else {        x;  // {} | null | undefined    }}function narrowUnknown(x: unknown) {    if (x) {        x;  // used to be 'unknown', now '{}'    }    else {        x;  // unknown    }}
```



Generic values also get narrowed similarly.
When checking that a value isn’t `null` or `undefined`, TypeScript now just intersects it with `{}` - which again, is the same as saying it’s `NonNullable`.
Putting many of the changes here together, we can now define the following function without any type assertions.



```id
tsfunction throwIfNullable<T>(value: T): NonNullable<T> {    if (value === undefined || value === null) {        throw Error("Nullable value!");    }    // Used to fail because 'T' was not assignable to 'NonNullable<T>'.    // Now narrows to 'T & {}' and succeeds because that's just 'NonNullable<T>'.    return value;}
```



`value` now gets narrowed to `T & {}`, and is now identical with `NonNullable ` - so the body of the function just works with no TypeScript-specific syntax.

On their own, these changes may appear small - but they represent fixes for many many paper cuts that have been reported over several years.

For more specifics on these improvements, you can read more here .

## Improved Inference for `infer` Types in Template String Types

TypeScript recently introduced a way to add `extends` constraints to `infer` type variables in conditional types.



```id
ts// Grabs the first element of a tuple if it's assignable to 'number',// and returns 'never' if it can't find one.type TryGetNumberIfFirst<T> =    T extends [infer U extends number, ...unknown[]] ? U : never;
```



If these `infer` types appear in a template string type and are constrained to a primitive type, TypeScript will now try to parse out a literal type.



```id
ts// SomeNum used to be 'number'; now it's '100'.type SomeNum = "100" extends `${infer U extends number}` ? U : never;// SomeBigInt used to be 'bigint'; now it's '100n'.type SomeBigInt = "100" extends `${infer U extends bigint}` ? U : never;// SomeBool used to be 'boolean'; now it's 'true'.type SomeBool = "true" extends `${infer U extends boolean}` ? U : never;
```



This can now better convey what a library will do at runtime, and give more precise types.

One note on this is that when TypeScript parses these literal types out it will greedily try to parse out as much of what looks like of the appropriate primitive type;
however it then checks to see if the print-back of that primitive matches up with the string contents.
In other words, TypeScript checks whether the going from the string, to the primitive, and back matches.
If it doesn’t see that the string can be “round-tripped”, then it will fall back to the base primitive type.



```id
ts// JustNumber is `number` here because TypeScript parses out `"1.0"`, but `String(Number("1.0"))` is `"1"` and doesn't match.type JustNumber = "1.0" extends `${infer T extends number}` ? T : never;
```



You can see more about this feature here .

## `--build`, `--watch`, and `--incremental` Performance Improvements

TypeScript 4.8 introduces several optimizations that should speed up scenarios around `--watch` and `--incremental`, along with project references builds using `--build`.
For example, TypeScript is now able to avoid spending time updating timestamps during no-op changes in `--watch` mode, which makes rebuilds faster and avoids messing with other build tools that might be watching for TypeScript’s output.
Many other optimizations where we’re able to reuse information across `--build`, `--watch`, and `--incremental` have been introduced as well.

How big are these improvements?
Well, on a fairly large internal codebase, we’ve seen time reductions on the order of 10%-25% on many simple common operations, with around 40% time reductions in no-change scenarios.
We’ve seen similar results on the TypeScript codebase as well.

You can see the changes, along with the performance results on GitHub .

## Errors When Comparing Object and Array Literals

In many languages, operators like `==` perform what’s called “value” equality on objects.
For example, in Python it’s valid to check whether a list is empty by checking whether a value is equal to the empty list using `==`.



```id
pyif people_at_home == []:    print("here's where I lie, broken inside. </3")    adopt_animals()
```



This is not the case in JavaScript, where `==` and `===` between objects (and therefore, arrays) check whether both references point to the same value.
We believe that similar code in JavaScript is at best an early foot-gun for JavaScript developers, and at worst a bug in production code.
That’s why TypeScript now disallows code like the following.



```id
tsif (peopleAtHome === []) {//  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// This condition will always return 'false' since JavaScript compares objects by reference, not value.    console.log("here's where I lie, broken inside. </3")    adoptAnimals();}
```



We’d like to extend our gratitude to Jack Works who contributed this check.
You can view the changes involved here .

## Improved Inference from Binding Patterns

In some cases, TypeScript will pick up a type from a binding pattern to make better inferences.



```id
tsdeclare function chooseRandomly<T>(x: T, y: T): T;let [a, b, c] = chooseRandomly([42, true, "hi!"], [0, false, "bye!"]);//   ^  ^  ^//   |  |  |//   |  |  string//   |  |//   |  boolean//   |//   number
```



When `chooseRandomly` needs to figure out a type for `T`, it will primarily look at `[42, true, "hi!"]` and `[0, false, "bye!"]`;
but TypeScript needs to figure out whether those two types should be `Array ` or the tuple type `[number, boolean, string]`.
To do that, it will look for existing candidates as a hint to see whether there are any tuple types.
When TypeScript sees the binding pattern `[a, b, c]`, it creates the type `[any, any, any]`, and that type gets picked up as a low-priority candidate for `T` which also gets used as a hint for the types of `[42, true, "hi!"]` and `[0, false, "bye!"]`.

You can see how this was good for `chooseRandomly`, but it fell short in other cases.
For example, take the following code



```id
tsdeclare function f<T>(x?: T): T;let [x, y, z] = f();
```



The binding pattern `[x, y, z]` hinted that `f` should produce an `[any, any, any]` tuple;
but `f` really shouldn’t change its type argument based on a binding pattern.
It can’t suddenly conjure up a new array-like value based on what it’s being assigned to, so the binding pattern type has way too much influence on the produced type.
On top of that, because the binding pattern type is full of `any`s, we’re left with `x`, `y`, and `z` being typed as `any`.

In TypeScript 4.8, these binding patterns are never used as candidates for type arguments.
Instead, they’re just consulted in case a parameter needs a more specific type like in our `chooseRandomly` example.
If you need to revert to the old behavior, you can always provide explicit type arguments.

You can look at the change on GitHub if you’re curious to learn more.

## File-Watching Fixes (Especially Across `git checkout`s)

We’ve had a long-standing bug where TypeScript has a very hard time with certain file changes in `--watch` mode and editor scenarios.
Sometimes the symptoms are stale or inaccurate errors that might show up that require restarting `tsc` or VS Code.
Frequently these occur on Unix systems, and you might have seen these after saving a file with vim or swapping branches in git.

This was caused by assumptions of how Node.js handles rename events across file systems.
File systems used by Linux and macOS utilize inodes , and Node.js will attach file watchers to inodes rather than file paths .
So when Node.js returns a watcher object , it might be watching a path or an inode depending on the platform and file system.

To be a bit more efficient, TypeScript tries to reuse the same watcher objects if it detects a path still exists on disk.
This is where things went wrong, because even if a file still exists at that path, a distinct file might have been created, and that file will have a different inode.
So TypeScript would end up reusing the watcher object instead of installing a new watcher at the original location, and watch for changes at what might be a totally irrelevant file.
So TypeScript 4.8 now handles these cases on inode systems and properly installs a new watcher and fixes this.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Marc Celani and his team at Airtable who invested lots of time in investigating the issues they were experiencing and pointing out the root cause.
You can view the specific fixes around file-watching here .

## Find-All-References Performance Improvements

When running find-all-references in your editor, TypeScript is now able to act a little smarter as it aggregates references.
This reduced the amount of time TypeScript took to search a widely-used identifier in its own codebase by about 20%.

 You can read up more on the improvement here .

## Exclude Specific Files from Auto-Imports

TypeScript 4.8 introduces an editor preference for excluding files from auto-imports.
In Visual Studio Code, file names or globs can be added under “Auto Import File Exclude Patterns” in the Settings UI, or in a `.vscode/settings.json` file:



```id
jsonc{    // Note that `javascript.preferences.autoImportFileExcludePatterns` can be specified for JavaScript too.    "typescript.preferences.autoImportFileExcludePatterns": [      "**/node_modules/@types/node"    ]}
```



This can be useful in cases where you can’t avoid having certain modules or libraries in your compilation but you rarely want to import from them.
These modules might have lots of exports that can pollute the auto-imports list and make it harder to navigate, and this option can help in those situations.

You can see more specifics about the implementation here .

## Correctness Fixes and Breaking Changes

Due to the nature of type system changes, there are very few changes that can be made that don’t affect some code;
however, there are a few changes that are more likely to require adapting existing code.

### `lib.d.ts` Updates

While TypeScript strives to avoid major breaks, even small changes in the built-in libraries can cause issues.
We don’t expect major breaks as a result of DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates, but one notable change is that the `cause` property on `Error`s now has the type `unknown` instead of `Error`.

### Unconstrained Generics No Longer Assignable to `{}`

In TypeScript 4.8, for projects with `strictNullChecks` enabled, TypeScript will now correctly issue an error when an unconstrained type parameter is used in a position where `null` or `undefined` are not legal values.
That will include any type that expects `{}`, `object`, or an object type with all-optional properties.

A simple example can be seen in the following.



```id
ts// Accepts any non-null non-undefined valuefunction bar(value: {}) {  Object.keys(value); // This call throws on null/undefined at runtime.}// Unconstrained type parameter T...function foo<T>(x: T) {    bar(x); // Used to be allowed, now is an error in 4.8.    //  ~    // error: Argument of type 'T' is not assignable to parameter of type '{}'.}foo(undefined);
```



As demonstrated above, code like this has a potential bug - the values `null` and `undefined` can be indirectly passed through these unconstrained type parameters to code that is not supposed to observe those values.

This behavior will also be visible in type positions. One example would be:



```id
tsinterface Foo<T> {  x: Bar<T>;}interface Bar<T extends {}> { }
```



Existing code that didn’t want to handle `null` and `undefined` can be fixed by propagating the appropriate constraints through.



```id
diff- function foo<T>(x: T) {+ function foo<T extends {}>(x: T) {
```



Another work-around would be to check for `null` and `undefined` at runtime.



```id
diff  function foo<T>(x: T) {+     if (x !== null && x !== undefined) {          bar(x);+     }  }
```



And if you know that for some reason, your generic value can’t be `null` or `undefined`, you can just use a non-null assertion.



```id
diff  function foo<T>(x: T) {-     bar(x);+     bar(x!);  }
```



When it comes to types, you’ll often either need to propagate constraints, or intersect your types with `{}`.

For more information, you can see the change that introduced this along with the specific discussion issue regarding how unconstrained generics now work .

### Decorators are placed on `modifiers` on TypeScript’s Syntax Trees

The current direction of decorators in TC39 means that TypeScript will have to handle a break in terms of placement of decorators.
Previously, TypeScript assumed decorators would always be placed prior to all keywords/modifiers.
For example



```id
ts@decoratorexport class Foo {  // ...}
```



Decorators as currently proposed do not support this syntax.
Instead, the `export` keyword must precede the decorator.



```id
tsexport @decorator class Foo {  // ...}
```



Unfortunately, TypeScript’s trees are concrete rather than abstract , and our architecture expects syntax tree node fields to be entirely ordered before or after each other.
To support both legacy decorators and decorators as proposed, TypeScript will have to gracefully parse, and intersperse, modifiers and decorators.

To do this, it exposes a new type alias called `ModifierLike` which is a `Modifier` or a `Decorator`.



```id
tsexport type ModifierLike = Modifier | Decorator;
```



Decorators are now placed in the same field as `modifiers` which is now a `NodeArray ` when set, and the entire field is deprecated.



```id
diff- readonly modifiers?: NodeArray<Modifier> | undefined;+ /**+  * @deprecated ...+  * Use `ts.canHaveModifiers()` to test whether a `Node` can have modifiers.+  * Use `ts.getModifiers()` to get the modifiers of a `Node`.+  * ...+  */+ readonly modifiers?: NodeArray<ModifierLike> | undefined;
```



All existing `decorators` properties have been marked as deprecated and will always be `undefined` if read.
The type has also been changed to `undefined` so that existing tools know to handle them correctly.



```id
diff- readonly decorators?: NodeArray<Decorator> | undefined;+ /**+  * @deprecated ...+  * Use `ts.canHaveDecorators()` to test whether a `Node` can have decorators.+  * Use `ts.getDecorators()` to get the decorators of a `Node`.+  * ...+  */+ readonly decorators?: undefined;
```



To avoid new deprecation warnings and other issues, TypeScript now exposes four new functions to use in place of the `decorators` and `modifiers` properties.
There are individual predicates for testing whether a node has support modifiers and decorators, along with respective accessor functions for grabbing them.



```id
tsfunction canHaveModifiers(node: Node): node is HasModifiers;function getModifiers(node: HasModifiers): readonly Modifier[] | undefined;function canHaveDecorators(node: Node): node is HasDecorators;function getDecorators(node: HasDecorators): readonly Decorator[] | undefined;
```



As an example of how to access modifiers off of a node, you can write



```id
tsconst modifiers = canHaveModifiers(myNode) ? getModifiers(myNode) : undefined;
```



With the note that each call to `getModifiers` and `getDecorators` may allocate a new array.

### Types Cannot Be Imported/Exported in JavaScript Files

TypeScript previously allowed JavaScript files to import and export entities declared with a type, but no value, in `import` and `export` statements.
This behavior was incorrect, because named imports and exports for values that don’t exist will cause a runtime error under ECMAScript modules.
When a JavaScript file is type-checked under `--checkJs` or through a `// @ts-check` comment, TypeScript will now issue an error.



```id
ts// @ts-check// Will fail at runtime because 'SomeType' is not a value.import { someValue, SomeType } from "some-module";/** * @type {SomeType} */export const myValue = someValue;/** * @typedef {string | number} MyType */// Will fail at runtime because 'MyType' is not a value.export { MyType as MyExportedType };
```



To reference a type from another module, you can instead directly qualify the import.



```id
diff- import { someValue, SomeType } from "some-module";+ import { someValue } from "some-module";    /**-  * @type {SomeType}+  * @type {import("some-module").SomeType}   */  export const myValue = someValue;
```



To export a type, you can just use a `/** @typedef */` comment in JSDoc.
`@typedef` comments already automatically export types from their containing modules.



```id
diff  /**   * @typedef {string | number} MyType   */+ /**+  * @typedef {MyType} MyExportedType+  */- export { MyType as MyExportedType };
```



You can read more about the change here .

### Binding Patterns Do Not Directly Contribute to Inference Candidates

As mentioned above, binding patterns no longer change the type of inference results in function calls.
You can read more about the original change here .

### Unused Renames in Binding Patterns are Now Errors in Type Signatures

TypeScript’s type annotation syntax often looks like it can be used when destructuring values.
For example, take the following function.



```id
tsdeclare function makePerson({ name: string, age: number }): Person;
```



You might read this signature and think that `makePerson` obviously takes an object with a `name` property with the type `string` and an `age` property with the type `number`;
however, JavaScript’s destructuring syntax is actually taking precedence here.
`makePerson` does say that it’s going to take an object with a `name` and an `age` property, but instead of specifying a type for them, it’s just saying that it renames `name` and `age` to `string` and `number` respectively.

In a pure type construct, writing code like this is useless, and typically a mistake since developers usually assume they’re writing a type annotation.

TypeScript 4.8 makes these an error unless they’re referenced later in the signature.
The correct way to write the above signature would be as follows:



```id
tsdeclare function makePerson(options: { name: string, age: number }): Person;// ordeclare function makePerson({ name, age }: { name: string, age: number }): Person;
```



This change can catch bugs in declarations, and has been helpful for improving existing code.
We’d like to extend our thanks to GitHub user uhyo for providing this check.

# TypeScript 4.0

 

## Variadic Tuple Types

Consider a function in JavaScript called `concat` that takes two array or tuple types and concatenates them together to make a new array.



```id
jsfunction concat(arr1, arr2) {  return [...arr1, ...arr2];}
```



Also consider `tail`, that takes an array or tuple, and returns all elements but the first.



```id
jsfunction tail(arg) {  const [_, ...result] = arg;  return result;}
```



How would we type either of these in TypeScript?

For `concat`, the only valid thing we could do in older versions of the language was to try and write some overloads.



```id
tsfunction concat(arr1: [], arr2: []): [];function concat<A>(arr1: [A], arr2: []): [A];function concat<A, B>(arr1: [A, B], arr2: []): [A, B];function concat<A, B, C>(arr1: [A, B, C], arr2: []): [A, B, C];function concat<A, B, C, D>(arr1: [A, B, C, D], arr2: []): [A, B, C, D];function concat<A, B, C, D, E>(arr1: [A, B, C, D, E], arr2: []): [A, B, C, D, E];function concat<A, B, C, D, E, F>(arr1: [A, B, C, D, E, F], arr2: []): [A, B, C, D, E, F];
```



Uh…okay, that’s…seven overloads for when the second array is always empty.
Let’s add some for when `arr2` has one argument.

 


```id
tsfunction concat<A2>(arr1: [], arr2: [A2]): [A2];function concat<A1, A2>(arr1: [A1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, C1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1, C1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, C1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, C1, D1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1, C1, D1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, C1, D1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1, C1, D1, E1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, A2];
```



We hope it’s clear that this is getting unreasonable.
Unfortunately, you’d also end up with the same sorts of issues typing a function like `tail`.

This is another case of what we like to call “death by a thousand overloads”, and it doesn’t even solve the problem generally.
It only gives correct types for as many overloads as we care to write.
If we wanted to make a catch-all case, we’d need an overload like the following:



```id
tsfunction concat<T, U>(arr1: T[], arr2: U[]): Array<T | U>;
```



But that signature doesn’t encode anything about the lengths of the input, or the order of the elements, when using tuples.

TypeScript 4.0 brings two fundamental changes, along with inference improvements, to make typing these possible.

The first change is that spreads in tuple type syntax can now be generic.
This means that we can represent higher-order operations on tuples and arrays even when we don’t know the actual types we’re operating over.
When generic spreads are instantiated (or, replaced with a real type) in these tuple types, they can produce other sets of array and tuple types.

For example, that means we can type function like `tail`, without our “death by a thousand overloads” issue.



```id
tsfunction (arr: readonly [any, ...T]): [...T]' >tail<(arr: readonly [any, ...T]): [...T]' >T extends any[]>(arr: readonly [any, ...(arr: readonly [any, ...T]): [...T]' >T]) {  const [_ignored, ...rest] = arr;  return rest;} const myTuple = [1, 2, 3, 4] as const;const myArray = ["hello", "world"]; const r1 = (arr: readonly [any, 2, 3, 4]): [2, 3, 4]' >tail(myTuple);      const r1: [2, 3, 4] const r2 = (arr: readonly [any, 2, 3, 4, ...string[]]): [2, 3, 4, ...string[]]' >tail([...myTuple, ...myArray] as const);      const r2: [2, 3, 4, ...string[]]Try
```



The second change is that rest elements can occur anywhere in a tuple - not just at the end!



```id
tstype Strings = [string, string];type Numbers = [number, number];type StrStrNumNumBool = [...Strings, ...Numbers, boolean];
```



Previously, TypeScript would issue an error like the following:



```
A rest element must be last in a tuple type.
```



But with TypeScript 4.0, this restriction is relaxed.

Note that in cases when we spread in a type without a known length, the resulting type becomes unbounded as well, and all the following elements factor into the resulting rest element type.



```id
tstype Strings = [string, string];type Numbers = number[];type Unbounded = [...Strings, ...Numbers, boolean];
```



By combining both of these behaviors together, we can write a single well-typed signature for `concat`:



```id
tstype Arr = readonly any[]; function (arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >concat<(arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >T extends Arr, (arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >U extends Arr>(arr1: (arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >T, arr2: (arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >U): [...(arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >T, ...(arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >U] {  return [...arr1, ...arr2];}Try
```



While that one signature is still a bit lengthy, it’s just one signature that doesn’t have to be repeated, and it gives predictable behavior on all arrays and tuples.

This functionality on its own is great, but it shines in more sophisticated scenarios too.
For example, consider a function to partially apply arguments called `partialCall`.
`partialCall` takes a function - let’s call it `f` - along with the initial few arguments that `f` expects.
It then returns a new function that takes any other arguments that `f` still needs, and calls `f` when it receives them.



```id
jsfunction partialCall(f, ...headArgs) {  return (...tailArgs) => f(...headArgs, ...tailArgs);}
```



TypeScript 4.0 improves the inference process for rest parameters and rest tuple elements so that we can type this and have it “just work”.



```id
tstype Arr = readonly unknown[]; function (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >partialCall<(f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >T extends Arr, (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >U extends Arr, (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >R>(   R' >f: (...args: [...(f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >T, ...(f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >U]) => (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >R,  ...headArgs: (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >T) {  return (...tailArgs: (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >U) =>  R' >f(...headArgs, ...tailArgs);}Try
```



In this case, `partialCall` understands which parameters it can and can’t initially take, and returns functions that appropriately accept and reject anything left over.



```id
tsconst  void' >foo = (x: string, y: number, z: boolean) => {}; const  void' >f1 = (f: (x: string, y: number, z: boolean) => void, x: string): (...tailArgs: [y: number, z: boolean]) => void' >partialCall( void' >foo, 100);Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.2345Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'. const  void' >f2 = (f: (x: string, y: number, z: boolean) => void, x: string, y: number, z: boolean): (...tailArgs: []) => void' >partialCall( void' >foo, "hello", 100, true, "oops");Expected 4 arguments, but got 5.2554Expected 4 arguments, but got 5. // This works!const  void' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>f3 = (f: (args_0: string, y: number, z: boolean) => void, headArgs_0: string): (...tailArgs: [y: number, z: boolean]) => void' >partialCall( void' >foo, "hello");      const f3: (y: number, z: boolean) => void // What can we do with f3 now? // Works! void' >f3(123, true);  void' >f3();Expected 2 arguments, but got 0.2554Expected 2 arguments, but got 0.  void' >f3(123, "hello");Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'boolean'.2345Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'boolean'.Try
```



Variadic tuple types enable a lot of new exciting patterns, especially around function composition.
We expect we may be able to leverage it to do a better job type-checking JavaScript’s built-in `bind` method.
A handful of other inference improvements and patterns also went into this, and if you’re interested in learning more, you can take a look at the pull request for variadic tuples.

## Labeled Tuple Elements

Improving the experience around tuple types and parameter lists is important because it allows us to get strongly typed validation around common JavaScript idioms - really just slicing and dicing argument lists and passing them to other functions.
The idea that we can use tuple types for rest parameters is one place where this is crucial.

For example, the following function that uses a tuple type as a rest parameter…



```id
tsfunction foo(...args: [string, number]): void {  // ...}
```



…should appear no different from the following function…



```id
tsfunction foo(arg0: string, arg1: number): void {  // ...}
```



…for any caller of `foo`.



```id
tsfoo("hello", 42); foo("hello", 42, true);Expected 2 arguments, but got 3.2554Expected 2 arguments, but got 3.foo("hello");Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.2554Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.Try
```



There is one place where the differences begin to become observable though: readability.
In the first example, we have no parameter names for the first and second elements.
While these have no impact on type-checking, the lack of labels on tuple positions can make them harder to use - harder to communicate our intent.

That’s why in TypeScript 4.0, tuples types can now provide labels.



```id
tstype Range = [start: number, end: number];
```



To deepen the connection between parameter lists and tuple types, the syntax for rest elements and optional elements mirrors the syntax for parameter lists.



```id
tstype Foo = [first: number, second?: string, ...rest: any[]];
```



There are a few rules when using labeled tuples.
For one, when labeling a tuple element, all other elements in the tuple must also be labeled.



```id
tstype Bar = [first: string, number];Try
```



It’s worth noting - labels don’t require us to name our variables differently when destructuring.
They’re purely there for documentation and tooling.



```id
tsfunction foo(x: [first: string, second: number]) {    // ...     // note: we didn&apos;t need to name these &apos;first&apos; and &apos;second&apos;    const [a, b] = x;    a   const a: string    b   const b: number}Try
```



Overall, labeled tuples are handy when taking advantage of patterns around tuples and argument lists, along with implementing overloads in a type-safe way.
In fact, TypeScript’s editor support will try to display them as overloads when possible.

 

To learn more, check out the pull request for labeled tuple elements.

## Class Property Inference from Constructors

TypeScript 4.0 can now use control flow analysis to determine the types of properties in classes when `noImplicitAny` is enabled.

 


```id
tsclass Square {  // Previously both of these were any  area;   (property) Square.area: number  sideLength;      (property) Square.sideLength: number  constructor(sideLength: number) {    this.sideLength = sideLength;    this.area = sideLength ** 2;  }}Try
```



In cases where not all paths of a constructor assign to an instance member, the property is considered to potentially be `undefined`.

 


```id
tsclass Square {  sideLength;      (property) Square.sideLength: number | undefined   constructor(sideLength: number) {    if (Math.random()) {      this.sideLength = sideLength;    }  }   get area() {    return this.sideLength ** 2;Object is possibly 'undefined'.2532Object is possibly 'undefined'.  }}Try
```



In cases where you know better (e.g. you have an `initialize` method of some sort), you’ll still need an explicit type annotation along with a definite assignment assertion (`!`) if you’re in `strictPropertyInitialization` .



```id
tsclass Square {  // definite assignment assertion  //        v  sideLength!: number;  // type annotation   constructor(sideLength: number) {    this.initialize(sideLength);  }   initialize(sideLength: number) {    this.sideLength = sideLength;  }   get area() {    return this.sideLength ** 2;  }}Try
```



For more details, see the implementing pull request .

## Short-Circuiting Assignment Operators

JavaScript, and a lot of other languages, support a set of operators called compound assignment operators.
Compound assignment operators apply an operator to two arguments, and then assign the result to the left side.
You may have seen these before:



```id
ts// Addition// a = a + ba += b;// Subtraction// a = a - ba -= b;// Multiplication// a = a * ba *= b;// Division// a = a / ba /= b;// Exponentiation// a = a ** ba **= b;// Left Bit Shift// a = a << ba <<= b;
```



So many operators in JavaScript have a corresponding assignment operator!
Up until recently, however, there were three notable exceptions: logical and (`&&`), logical or (`||`), and nullish coalescing (`??`).

That’s why TypeScript 4.0 supports a new ECMAScript feature to add three new assignment operators: `&&=`, `||=`, and `??=`.

These operators are great for substituting any example where a user might write code like the following:



```id
tsa = a && b;a = a || b;a = a ?? b;
```



Or a similar `if` block like



```id
ts// could be 'a ||= b'if (!a) {  a = b;}
```



There are even some patterns we’ve seen (or, uh, written ourselves) to lazily initialize values, only if they’ll be needed.



```id
tslet values: string[];(values ?? (values = [])).push("hello");// After(values ??= []).push("hello");
```



(look, we’re not proud of all the code we write…)

On the rare case that you use getters or setters with side-effects, it’s worth noting that these operators only perform assignments if necessary.
In that sense, not only is the right side of the operator “short-circuited” - the assignment itself is too.



```id
tsobj.prop ||= foo();// roughly equivalent to either of the followingobj.prop || (obj.prop = foo());if (!obj.prop) {    obj.prop = foo();}
```



 Try running the following example to see how that differs from always performing the assignment.



```id
tsconst obj = {    get prop() {        console.log("getter has run");         // Replace me!        return Math.random() < 0.5;    },    set prop(_val: boolean) {        console.log("setter has run");    }}; function foo() {    console.log("right side evaluated");    return true;} console.log("This one always runs the setter");obj.prop = obj.prop || foo(); console.log("This one *sometimes* runs the setter");obj.prop ||= foo();Try
```



We’d like to extend a big thanks to community member Wenlu Wang for this contribution!

For more details, you can take a look at the pull request here .
You can also check out TC39’s proposal repository for this feature .

## `unknown` on `catch` Clause Bindings

Since the beginning days of TypeScript, `catch` clause variables have always been typed as `any`.
This meant that TypeScript allowed you to do anything you wanted with them.



```id
tstry {  // Do some work} catch (x) {  // x has type &apos;any&apos; - have fun!  console.log(x.message);  console.log(x.toUpperCase());  x++;  x.yadda.yadda.yadda();}Try
```



The above has some undesirable behavior if we’re trying to prevent more errors from happening in our error-handling code!
Because these variables have the type `any` by default, they lack any type-safety which could have errored on invalid operations.

That’s why TypeScript 4.0 now lets you specify the type of `catch` clause variables as `unknown` instead.
`unknown` is safer than `any` because it reminds us that we need to perform some sorts of type-checks before operating on our values.

 


```id
tstry {  // ...} catch (e: unknown) {  // Can&apos;t access values on unknowns  console.log(e.toUpperCase());'e' is of type 'unknown'.18046'e' is of type 'unknown'.   if (typeof e === "string") {    // We&apos;ve narrowed &apos;e&apos; down to the type &apos;string&apos;.    console.log(e.toUpperCase());  }}Try
```



While the types of `catch` variables won’t change by default, we might consider a new `strict` mode flag in the future so that users can opt in to this behavior.
In the meantime, it should be possible to write a lint rule to force `catch` variables to have an explicit annotation of either `: any` or `: unknown`.

For more details you can peek at the changes for this feature .

## Custom JSX Factories

When using JSX, a fragment is a type of JSX element that allows us to return multiple child elements.
When we first implemented fragments in TypeScript, we didn’t have a great idea about how other libraries would utilize them.
Nowadays most other libraries that encourage using JSX and support fragments have a similar API shape.

In TypeScript 4.0, users can customize the fragment factory through the new `jsxFragmentFactory` option.

As an example, the following `tsconfig.json` file tells TypeScript to transform JSX in a way compatible with React, but switches each factory invocation to `h` instead of `React.createElement`, and uses `Fragment` instead of `React.Fragment`.



```
{  "compilerOptions": {    "target": "esnext",    "module": "commonjs",    "jsx": "react",    "jsxFactory": "h",    "jsxFragmentFactory": "Fragment"  }}
```



In cases where you need to have a different JSX factory on a per-file basis , you can take advantage of the new `/** @jsxFrag */` pragma comment.
For example, the following…



```id
tsx// Note: these pragma comments need to be written// with a JSDoc-style multiline syntax to take effect. /** @jsx h *//** @jsxFrag Fragment */ import { h, Fragment } from "preact"; export const Header = (  <>    <, HTMLHeadingElement>' >h1>Welcome</, HTMLHeadingElement>' >h1>  </>);Try
```



…will get transformed to this output JavaScript…



```id
tsximport React from &apos;react&apos;;export const Header = (React.createElement(React.Fragment, null,    React.createElement("h1", null, "Welcome"))); Try
```

## Speed Improvements in `build` mode with `--noEmitOnError`

Previously, compiling a program after a previous compile with errors under `incremental` would be extremely slow when using the `noEmitOnError` flag.
This is because none of the information from the last compilation would be cached in a `.tsbuildinfo` file based on the `noEmitOnError` flag.

TypeScript 4.0 changes this which gives a great speed boost in these scenarios, and in turn improves `--build` mode scenarios (which imply both `incremental` and `noEmitOnError` ).

For details, read up more on the pull request .

## `--incremental` with `--noEmit`

TypeScript 4.0 allows us to use the `noEmit` flag while still leveraging `incremental` compiles.
This was previously not allowed, as `incremental` needs to emit a `.tsbuildinfo` files; however, the use-case to enable faster incremental builds is important enough to enable for all users.

For more details, you can see the implementing pull request .

## Editor Improvements

The TypeScript compiler doesn’t only power the editing experience for TypeScript itself in most major editors - it also powers the JavaScript experience in the Visual Studio family of editors and more.
For that reason, much of our work focuses on improving editor scenarios - the place you spend most of your time as a developer.

Using new TypeScript/JavaScript functionality in your editor will differ depending on your editor, but

 Visual Studio Code supports selecting different versions of TypeScript . Alternatively, there’s the JavaScript/TypeScript Nightly Extension to stay on the bleeding edge (which is typically very stable).

- Visual Studio 2017/2019 have [the SDK installers above] and MSBuild installs .

- Sublime Text 3 supports selecting different versions of TypeScript 

You can check out a partial list of editors that have support for TypeScript to learn more about whether your favorite editor has support to use new versions.

### Convert to Optional Chaining

Optional chaining is a recent feature that’s received a lot of love.
That’s why TypeScript 4.0 brings a new refactoring to convert common patterns to take advantage of optional chaining and nullish coalescing !

 

Keep in mind that while this refactoring doesn’t perfectly capture the same behavior due to subtleties with truthiness/falsiness in JavaScript, we believe it should capture the intent for most use-cases, especially when TypeScript has more precise knowledge of your types.

For more details, check out the pull request for this feature .

### `/** @deprecated */` Support

TypeScript’s editing support now recognizes when a declaration has been marked with a `/** @deprecated */` JSDoc comment.
That information is surfaced in completion lists and as a suggestion diagnostic that editors can handle specially.
In an editor like VS Code, deprecated values are typically displayed in a strike-though style like this .

 

This new functionality is available thanks to Wenlu Wang .
See the pull request for more details.

### Partial Semantic Mode at Startup

We’ve heard a lot from users suffering from long startup times, especially on bigger projects.
The culprit is usually a process called program construction .
This is the process of starting with an initial set of root files, parsing them, finding their dependencies, parsing those dependencies, finding those dependencies’ dependencies, and so on.
The bigger your project is, the longer you’ll have to wait before you can get basic editor operations like go-to-definition or quick info.

That’s why we’ve been working on a new mode for editors to provide a partial experience until the full language service experience has loaded up.
The core idea is that editors can run a lightweight partial server that only looks at the current files that the editor has open.

It’s hard to say precisely what sorts of improvements you’ll see, but anecdotally, it used to take anywhere between 20 seconds to a minute before TypeScript would become fully responsive on the Visual Studio Code codebase.
In contrast, our new partial semantic mode seems to bring that delay down to just a few seconds .
As an example, in the following video, you can see two side-by-side editors with TypeScript 3.9 running on the left and TypeScript 4.0 running on the right.

 
 

When restarting both editors on a particularly large codebase, the one with TypeScript 3.9 can’t provide completions or quick info at all.
On the other hand, the editor with TypeScript 4.0 can immediately give us a rich experience in the current file we’re editing, despite loading the full project in the background.

Currently the only editor that supports this mode is Visual Studio Code which has some UX improvements coming up in Visual Studio Code Insiders .
We recognize that this experience may still have room for polish in UX and functionality, and we have a list of improvements in mind.
We’re looking for more feedback on what you think might be useful.

For more information, you can see the original proposal , the implementing pull request , along with the follow-up meta issue .

### Smarter Auto-Imports

Auto-import is a fantastic feature that makes coding a lot easier; however, every time auto-import doesn’t seem to work, it can throw users off a lot.
One specific issue that we heard from users was that auto-imports didn’t work on dependencies that were written in TypeScript - that is, until they wrote at least one explicit import somewhere else in their project.

Why would auto-imports work for `@types` packages, but not for packages that ship their own types?
It turns out that auto-imports only work on packages your project already includes.
Because TypeScript has some quirky defaults that automatically add packages in `node_modules/@types` to your project, those packages would be auto-imported.
On the other hand, other packages were excluded because crawling through all your `node_modules` packages can be really expensive.

All of this leads to a pretty lousy getting started experience for when you’re trying to auto-import something that you’ve just installed but haven’t used yet.

TypeScript 4.0 now does a little extra work in editor scenarios to include the packages you’ve listed in your `package.json`’s `dependencies` (and `peerDependencies`) fields.
The information from these packages is only used to improve auto-imports, and doesn’t change anything else like type-checking.
This allows us to provide auto-imports for all of your dependencies that have types, without incurring the cost of a complete `node_modules` search.

In the rare cases when your `package.json` lists more than ten typed dependencies that haven’t been imported yet, this feature automatically disables itself to prevent slow project loading.
To force the feature to work, or to disable it entirely, you should be able to configure your editor.
For Visual Studio Code, this is the “Include Package JSON Auto Imports” (or 

```
typescript.preferences.includePackageJsonAutoImports
```

) setting.

## Our New Website!

 The TypeScript website has recently been rewritten from the ground up and rolled out!

 

 We already wrote a bit about our new site , so you can read up more there; but it’s worth mentioning that we’re still looking to hear what you think!
If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, you can file them over on the website’s issue tracker .

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Our `lib.d.ts` declarations have changed - most specifically, types for the DOM have changed.
The most notable change may be the removal of `document.origin` which only worked in old versions of IE and Safari
MDN recommends moving to `self.origin` .

### Properties Overriding Accessors (and vice versa) is an Error

Previously, it was only an error for properties to override accessors, or accessors to override properties, when using `useDefineForClassFields` ; however, TypeScript now always issues an error when declaring a property in a derived class that would override a getter or setter in the base class.



```id
tsclass Base {  get foo() {    return 100;  }  set foo(value) {    // ...  }} class Derived extends Base {  foo = 10;'foo' is defined as an accessor in class 'Base', but is overridden here in 'Derived' as an instance property.2610'foo' is defined as an accessor in class 'Base', but is overridden here in 'Derived' as an instance property.}Try
```




```id
tsclass Base {  prop = 10;} class Derived extends Base {  get prop() {'prop' is defined as a property in class 'Base', but is overridden here in 'Derived' as an accessor.2611'prop' is defined as a property in class 'Base', but is overridden here in 'Derived' as an accessor.    return 100;  }}Try
```



See more details on the implementing pull request .

### Operands for `delete` must be optional.

When using the `delete` operator in `strictNullChecks` , the operand must now be `any`, `unknown`, `never`, or be optional (in that it contains `undefined` in the type).
Otherwise, use of the `delete` operator is an error.



```id
tsinterface Thing {  prop: string;} function f(x: Thing) {  delete x.prop;The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional.2790The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional.}Try
```

### Usage of TypeScript’s Node Factory is Deprecated

Today TypeScript provides a set of “factory” functions for producing AST Nodes; however, TypeScript 4.0 provides a new node factory API.
As a result, for TypeScript 4.0 we’ve made the decision to deprecate these older functions in favor of the new ones.

For more details, read up on the relevant pull request for this change .

# TypeScript 4.7

 

## ECMAScript Module Support in Node.js

For the last few years, Node.js has been working to support ECMAScript modules (ESM).
This has been a very difficult feature, since the Node.js ecosystem is built on a different module system called CommonJS (CJS).
Interoperating between the two brings large challenges, with many new features to juggle;
however, support for ESM in Node.js was largely implemented in Node.js 12 and later.
Around TypeScript 4.5 we rolled out nightly-only support for ESM in Node.js to get some feedback from users and let library authors ready themselves for broader support.

TypeScript 4.7 adds this functionality with two new `module` settings: `node16` and `nodenext`.



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "module": "node16",    }}
```



These new modes bring a few high-level features which we’ll explore here.

### `type` in `package.json` and New Extensions

Node.js supports a new setting in `package.json` called `type`.
`"type"` can be set to either `"module"` or `"commonjs"`.



```id
jsonc{    "name": "my-package",    "type": "module",    "//": "...",    "dependencies": {    }}
```



This setting controls whether `.js` and `.d.ts` files are interpreted as ES modules or CommonJS modules, and defaults to CommonJS when not set.
When a file is considered an ES module, a few different rules come into play compared to CommonJS:

 `import`/`export` statements can be used.

- Top-level `await` can be used

- Relative import paths need full extensions (we have to write `import "./foo.js"` instead of `import "./foo"`).

- Imports might resolve differently from dependencies in `node_modules`.

- Certain global-like values like `require` and `module` cannot be used directly.

- CommonJS modules get imported under certain special rules.

We’ll come back to some of these.

To overlay the way TypeScript works in this system, `.ts` and `.tsx` files now work the same way.
When TypeScript finds a `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, or `.jsx` file, it will walk up looking for a `package.json` to see whether that file is an ES module, and use that to determine:

- how to find other modules which that file imports

- and how to transform that file if producing outputs

When a `.ts` file is compiled as an ES module, ECMAScript `import`/`export` statements are left alone in the `.js` output;
when it’s compiled as a CommonJS module, it will produce the same output you get today under `--module commonjs`.

This also means paths resolve differently between `.ts` files that are ES modules and ones that are CJS modules.
For example, let’s say you have the following code today:



```id
ts// ./foo.tsexport function helper() {    // ...}// ./bar.tsimport { helper } from "./foo"; // only works in CJShelper();
```



This code works in CommonJS modules, but will fail in ES modules because relative import paths need to use extensions.
As a result, it will have to be rewritten to use the extension of the output of `foo.ts` - so `bar.ts` will instead have to import from `./foo.js`.



```id
ts// ./bar.tsimport { helper } from "./foo.js"; // works in ESM & CJShelper();
```



This might feel a bit cumbersome at first, but TypeScript tooling like auto-imports and path completion will typically just do this for you.

One other thing to mention is the fact that this applies to `.d.ts` files too.
When TypeScript finds a `.d.ts` file in a package, it is interpreted based on the containing package.

### New File Extensions

The `type` field in `package.json` is nice because it allows us to continue using the `.ts` and `.js` file extensions which can be convenient;
however, you will occasionally need to write a file that differs from what `type` specifies.
You might also just prefer to always be explicit.

Node.js supports two extensions to help with this: `.mjs` and `.cjs`.
`.mjs` files are always ES modules, and `.cjs` files are always CommonJS modules, and there’s no way to override these.

In turn, TypeScript supports two new source file extensions: `.mts` and `.cts`.
When TypeScript emits these to JavaScript files, it will emit them to `.mjs` and `.cjs` respectively.

Furthermore, TypeScript also supports two new declaration file extensions: `.d.mts` and `.d.cts`.
When TypeScript generates declaration files for `.mts` and `.cts`, their corresponding extensions will be `.d.mts` and `.d.cts`.

Using these extensions is entirely optional, but will often be useful even if you choose not to use them as part of your primary workflow.

### CommonJS Interoperability

Node.js allows ES modules to import CommonJS modules as if they were ES modules with a default export.



```id
ts// ./foo.ctsexport function helper() {    console.log("hello world!");}// ./bar.mtsimport foo from "./foo.cjs";// prints "hello world!"foo.helper();
```



In some cases, Node.js also synthesizes named exports from CommonJS modules, which can be more convenient.
In these cases, ES modules can use a “namespace-style” import (i.e. `import * as foo from "..."`), or named imports (i.e. `import { helper } from "..."`).



```id
ts// ./foo.ctsexport function helper() {    console.log("hello world!");}// ./bar.mtsimport { helper } from "./foo.cjs";// prints "hello world!"helper();
```



There isn’t always a way for TypeScript to know whether these named imports will be synthesized, but TypeScript will err on being permissive and use some heuristics when importing from a file that is definitely a CommonJS module.

One TypeScript-specific note about interop is the following syntax:



```id
tsimport foo = require("foo");
```



In a CommonJS module, this just boils down to a `require()` call, and in an ES module, this imports `createRequire` to achieve the same thing.
This will make code less portable on runtimes like the browser (which don’t support `require()`), but will often be useful for interoperability.
In turn, you can write the above example using this syntax as follows:



```id
ts// ./foo.ctsexport function helper() {    console.log("hello world!");}// ./bar.mtsimport foo = require("./foo.cjs");foo.helper()
```



Finally, it’s worth noting that the only way to import ESM files from a CJS module is using dynamic `import()` calls.
This can present challenges, but is the behavior in Node.js today.

You can read more about ESM/CommonJS interop in Node.js here .

### `package.json` Exports, Imports, and Self-Referencing

Node.js supports a new field for defining entry points in `package.json` called `"exports"` .
This field is a more powerful alternative to defining `"main"` in `package.json`, and can control what parts of your package are exposed to consumers.

Here’s a `package.json` that supports separate entry-points for CommonJS and ESM:



```id
jsonc// package.json{    "name": "my-package",    "type": "module",    "exports": {        ".": {            // Entry-point for `import "my-package"` in ESM            "import": "./esm/index.js",            // Entry-point for `require("my-package") in CJS            "require": "./commonjs/index.cjs",        },    },    // CJS fall-back for older versions of Node.js    "main": "./commonjs/index.cjs",}
```



There’s a lot to this feature, which you can read more about on the Node.js documentation .
Here we’ll try to focus on how TypeScript supports it.

With TypeScript’s original Node support, it would look for a `"main"` field, and then look for declaration files that corresponded to that entry.
For example, if `"main"` pointed to `./lib/index.js`, TypeScript would look for a file called `./lib/index.d.ts`.
A package author could override this by specifying a separate field called `"types"` (e.g. `"types": "./types/index.d.ts"`).

The new support works similarly with import conditions .
By default, TypeScript overlays the same rules with import conditions - if you write an `import` from an ES module, it will look up the `import` field, and from a CommonJS module, it will look at the `require` field.
If it finds them, it will look for a corresponding declaration file.
If you need to point to a different location for your type declarations, you can add a `"types"` import condition.



```id
jsonc// package.json{    "name": "my-package",    "type": "module",    "exports": {        ".": {            // Entry-point for `import "my-package"` in ESM            "import": {                // Where TypeScript will look.                "types": "./types/esm/index.d.ts",                // Where Node.js will look.                "default": "./esm/index.js"            },            // Entry-point for `require("my-package") in CJS            "require": {                // Where TypeScript will look.                "types": "./types/commonjs/index.d.cts",                // Where Node.js will look.                "default": "./commonjs/index.cjs"            },        }    },    // Fall-back for older versions of TypeScript    "types": "./types/index.d.ts",    // CJS fall-back for older versions of Node.js    "main": "./commonjs/index.cjs"}
```


 

The `"types"` condition should always come first in `"exports"`.

 

It’s important to note that the CommonJS entrypoint and the ES module entrypoint each needs its own declaration file, even if the contents are the same between them.
Every declaration file is interpreted either as a CommonJS module or as an ES module, based on its file extension and the `"type"` field of the `package.json`, and this detected module kind must match the module kind that Node will detect for the corresponding JavaScript file for type checking to be correct.
Attempting to use a single `.d.ts` file to type both an ES module entrypoint and a CommonJS entrypoint will cause TypeScript to think only one of those entrypoints exists, causing compiler errors for users of the package.

TypeScript also supports the `"imports"` field of `package.json` in a similar manner by looking for declaration files alongside corresponding files, and supports packages self-referencing themselves .
These features are generally not as involved to set up, but are supported.

### Your Feedback Wanted!

As we continue working on TypeScript 4.7, we expect to see more documentation and polish go into this functionality.
Supporting these new features has been an ambitious under-taking, and that’s why we’re looking for early feedback on it!
Please try it out and let us know how it works for you.

For more information, you can see the implementing PR here .

## Control over Module Detection

One issue with the introduction of modules to JavaScript was the ambiguity between existing “script” code and the new module code.
JavaScript code in a module runs slightly differently, and has different scoping rules, so tools have to make decisions as to how each file runs.
For example, Node.js requires module entry-points to be written in a `.mjs`, or have a nearby `package.json` with `"type": "module"`.
TypeScript treats a file as a module whenever it finds any `import` or `export` statement in a file, but otherwise, will assume a `.ts` or `.js` file is a script file acting on the global scope.

This doesn’t quite match up with the behavior of Node.js where the `package.json` can change the format of a file, or the `--jsx` setting `react-jsx`, where any JSX file contains an implicit import to a JSX factory.
It also doesn’t match modern expectations where most new TypeScript code is written with modules in mind.

That’s why TypeScript 4.7 introduces a new option called `moduleDetection`.
`moduleDetection` can take on 3 values: `"auto"` (the default), `"legacy"` (the same behavior as 4.6 and prior), and `"force"`.

Under the mode `"auto"`, TypeScript will not only look for `import` and `export` statements, but it will also check whether

- the `"type"` field in `package.json` is set to `"module"` when running under `--module nodenext`/`--module node16`, and

- check whether the current file is a JSX file when running under `--jsx react-jsx`

In cases where you want every file to be treated as a module, the `"force"` setting ensures that every non-declaration file is treated as a module.
This will be true regardless of how `module`, `moduleResolution`, and `jsx` are configured.

Meanwhile, the `"legacy"` option simply goes back to the old behavior of only seeking out `import` and `export` statements to determine whether a file is a module.

You can read up more about this change on the pull request .

## Control-Flow Analysis for Bracketed Element Access

TypeScript 4.7 now narrows the types of element accesses when the indexed keys are literal types and unique symbols.
For example, take the following code:



```id
tsconst key = Symbol();const numberOrString = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 42 : "hello";const obj = {    [key]: numberOrString,};if (typeof obj[key] === "string") {    let str = obj[key].toUpperCase();}
```



Previously, TypeScript would not consider any type guards on `obj[key]`, and would have no idea that `obj[key]` was really a `string`.
Instead, it would think that `obj[key]` was still a `string | number` and accessing `toUpperCase()` would trigger an error.

TypeScript 4.7 now knows that `obj[key]` is a string.

This also means that under `--strictPropertyInitialization`, TypeScript can correctly check that computed properties are initialized by the end of a constructor body.



```id
ts// 'key' has type 'unique symbol'const key = Symbol();class C {    [key]: string;    constructor(str: string) {        // oops, forgot to set 'this[key]'    }    screamString() {        return this[key].toUpperCase();    }}
```



Under TypeScript 4.7, `--strictPropertyInitialization` reports an error telling us that the `[key]` property wasn’t definitely assigned by the end of the constructor.

We’d like to extend our gratitude to Oleksandr Tarasiuk who provided this change !

## Improved Function Inference in Objects and Methods

TypeScript 4.7 can now perform more granular inferences from functions within objects and arrays.
This allows the types of these functions to consistently flow in a left-to-right manner just like for plain arguments.



```id
tsdeclare function f<T>(arg: {    produce: (n: string) => T,    consume: (x: T) => void }): void;// Worksf({    produce: () => "hello",    consume: x => x.toLowerCase()});// Worksf({    produce: (n: string) => n,    consume: x => x.toLowerCase(),});// Was an error, now works.f({    produce: n => n,    consume: x => x.toLowerCase(),});// Was an error, now works.f({    produce: function () { return "hello"; },    consume: x => x.toLowerCase(),});// Was an error, now works.f({    produce() { return "hello" },    consume: x => x.toLowerCase(),});
```



Inference failed in some of these examples because knowing the type of their `produce` functions would indirectly request the type of `arg` before finding a good type for `T`.
TypeScript now gathers functions that could contribute to the inferred type of `T` and infers from them lazily.

For more information, you can take a look at the specific modifications to our inference process .

## Instantiation Expressions

Occasionally functions can be a bit more general than we want.
For example, let’s say we had a `makeBox` function.



```id
tsinterface Box<T> {    value: T;}function makeBox<T>(value: T) {    return { value };}
```



Maybe we want to create a more specialized set of functions for making `Box`es of `Wrench`es and `Hammer`s.
To do that today, we’d have to wrap `makeBox` in other functions, or use an explicit type for an alias of `makeBox`.



```id
tsfunction makeHammerBox(hammer: Hammer) {    return makeBox(hammer);}// or...const makeWrenchBox: (wrench: Wrench) => Box<Wrench> = makeBox;
```



These work, but wrapping a call to `makeBox` is a bit wasteful, and writing the full signature of `makeWrenchBox` could get unwieldy.
Ideally, we would be able to say that we just want to alias `makeBox` while replacing all of the generics in its signature.

TypeScript 4.7 allows exactly that!
We can now take functions and constructors and feed them type arguments directly.



```id
tsconst makeHammerBox = makeBox<Hammer>;const makeWrenchBox = makeBox<Wrench>;
```



So with this, we can specialize `makeBox` to accept more specific types and reject anything else.



```id
tsconst makeStringBox = makeBox<string>;// TypeScript correctly rejects this.makeStringBox(42);
```



This logic also works for constructor functions such as `Array`, `Map`, and `Set`.



```id
ts// Has type `new () => Map<string, Error>`const ErrorMap = Map<string, Error>;// Has type `// Map<string, Error>`const errorMap = new ErrorMap();
```



When a function or constructor is given type arguments, it will produce a new type that keeps all signatures with compatible type parameter lists, and replaces the corresponding type parameters with the given type arguments.
Any other signatures are dropped, as TypeScript will assume that they aren’t meant to be used.

For more information on this feature, check out the pull request .

## `extends` Constraints on `infer` Type Variables

Conditional types are a bit of a power-user feature.
They allow us to match and infer against the shape of types, and make decisions based on them.
For example, we can write a conditional type that returns the first element of a tuple type if it’s a `string`-like type.



```id
tstype FirstIfString<T> =    T extends [infer S, ...unknown[]]        ? S extends string ? S : never        : never; // stringtype A = FirstIfString<[string, number, number]>;// "hello"type B = FirstIfString<["hello", number, number]>;// "hello" | "world"type C = FirstIfString<["hello" | "world", boolean]>;// nevertype D = FirstIfString<[boolean, number, string]>;
```



`FirstIfString` matches against any tuple with at least one element and grabs the type of the first element as `S`.
Then it checks if `S` is compatible with `string` and returns that type if it is.

Note that we had to use two conditional types to write this.
We could have written `FirstIfString` as follows:



```id
tstype FirstIfString<T> =    T extends [string, ...unknown[]]        // Grab the first type out of `T`        ? T[0]        : never;
```



This works, but it’s slightly more “manual” and less declarative.
Instead of just pattern-matching on the type and giving the first element a name, we have to fetch out the `0`th element of `T` with `T[0]`.
If we were dealing with types more complex than tuples, this could get a lot trickier, so `infer` can simplify things.

Using nested conditionals to infer a type and then match against that inferred type is pretty common.
To avoid that second level of nesting, TypeScript 4.7 now allows you to place a constraint on any `infer` type.



```id
tstype FirstIfString<T> =    T extends [infer S extends string, ...unknown[]]        ? S        : never;
```



This way, when TypeScript matches against `S`, it also ensures that `S` has to be a `string`.
If `S` isn’t a `string`, it takes the false path, which in these cases is `never`.

For more details, you can read up on the change on GitHub .

## Optional Variance Annotations for Type Parameters

Let’s take the following types.



```id
tsinterface Animal {    animalStuff: any;}interface Dog extends Animal {    dogStuff: any;}// ...type Getter<T> = () => T;type Setter<T> = (value: T) => void;
```



Imagine we had two different instances of `Getter`s.
Figuring out whether any two different `Getter`s are substitutable for one another depends entirely on `T`.
In the case of whether an assignment of `Getter ` → `Getter ` is valid, we have to check whether `Dog` → `Animal` is valid.
Because each type for `T` just gets related in the same “direction”, we say that the `Getter` type is covariant on `T`.
On the other hand, checking whether `Setter ` → `Setter ` is valid involves checking whether `Animal` → `Dog` is valid.
That “flip” in direction is kind of like how in math, checking whether − x  <  −y is the same as checking whether y  <  x .
When we have to flip directions like this to compare `T`, we say that `Setter` is contravariant on `T`.

With TypeScript 4.7, we’re now able to explicitly specify variance on type parameters.

So now, if we want to make it explicit that `Getter` is covariant on `T`, we can now give it an `out` modifier.



```id
tstype Getter<out T> = () => T;
```



And similarly, if we also want to make it explicit that `Setter` is contravariant on `T`, we can give it an `in` modifier.



```id
tstype Setter<in T> = (value: T) => void;
```



`out` and `in` are used here because a type parameter’s variance depends on whether it’s used in an output or an input .
Instead of thinking about variance, you can just think about if `T` is used in output and input positions.

There are also cases for using both `in` and `out`.



```id
tsinterface State<in out T> {    get: () => T;    set: (value: T) => void;}
```



When a `T` is used in both an output and input position, it becomes invariant .
Two different `State `s can’t be interchanged unless their `T`s are the same.
In other words, `State ` and `State ` aren’t substitutable for the other.

Now technically speaking, in a purely structural type system, type parameters and their variance don’t really matter - you can just plug in types in place of each type parameter and check whether each matching member is structurally compatible.
So if TypeScript uses a structural type system, why are we interested in the variance of type parameters?
And why might we ever want to annotate them?

One reason is that it can be useful for a reader to explicitly see how a type parameter is used at a glance.
For much more complex types, it can be difficult to tell whether a type is meant to be read, written, or both.
TypeScript will also help us out if we forget to mention how that type parameter is used.
As an example, if we forgot to specify both `in` and `out` on `State`, we’d get an error.



```id
tsinterface State<out T> {    //          ~~~~~    // error!    // Type 'State<sub-T>' is not assignable to type 'State<super-T>' as implied by variance annotation.    //   Types of property 'set' are incompatible.    //     Type '(value: sub-T) => void' is not assignable to type '(value: super-T) => void'.    //       Types of parameters 'value' and 'value' are incompatible.    //         Type 'super-T' is not assignable to type 'sub-T'.    get: () => T;    set: (value: T) => void;}
```



Another reason is precision and speed!
TypeScript already tries to infer the variance of type parameters as an optimization.
By doing this, it can type-check larger structural types in a reasonable amount of time.
Calculating variance ahead of time allows the type-checker to skip deeper comparisons and just compare type arguments which can be much faster than comparing the full structure of a type over and over again.
But often there are cases where this calculation is still fairly expensive, and the calculation may find circularities that can’t be accurately resolved, meaning there’s no clear answer for the variance of a type.



```id
tstype Foo<T> = {    x: T;    f: Bar<T>;}type Bar<U> = (x: Baz<U[]>) => void;type Baz<V> = {    value: Foo<V[]>;}declare let foo1: Foo<unknown>;declare let foo2: Foo<string>;foo1 = foo2;  // Should be an error but isn't ❌foo2 = foo1;  // Error - correct ✅
```



Providing an explicit annotation can speed up type-checking at these circularities and provide better accuracy.
For instance, marking `T` as invariant in the above example can help stop the problematic assignment.



```id
diff- type Foo<T> = {+ type Foo<in out T> = {      x: T;      f: Bar<T>;  }
```



We don’t necessarily recommend annotating every type parameter with its variance;
For example, it’s possible (but not recommended) to make variance a little stricter than is necessary, so TypeScript won’t stop you from marking something as invariant if it’s really just covariant, contravariant, or even independent.
So if you do choose to add explicit variance markers, we would encourage thoughtful and precise use of them.

But if you’re working with deeply recursive types, especially if you’re a library author, you may be interested in using these annotations to the benefit of your users.
Those annotations can provide wins in both accuracy and type-checking speed, which can even affect their code editing experience.
Determining when variance calculation is a bottleneck on type-checking time can be done experimentally, and determined using tooling like our analyze-trace utility.

For more details on this feature, you can read up on the pull request .

## Resolution Customization with `moduleSuffixes`

TypeScript 4.7 now supports a `moduleSuffixes` option to customize how module specifiers are looked up.



```id
jsonc{    "compilerOptions": {        "moduleSuffixes": [".ios", ".native", ""]    }}
```



Given the above configuration, an import like the following…



```id
tsimport * as foo from "./foo";
```



will try to look at the relative files `./foo.ios.ts`, `./foo.native.ts`, and finally `./foo.ts`.

This feature can be useful for React Native projects where each target platform can use a separate `tsconfig.json` with differing `moduleSuffixes`.

 The `moduleSuffixes` option was contributed thanks to Adam Foxman !

## resolution-mode

With Node’s ECMAScript resolution, the mode of the containing file and the syntax you use determines how imports are resolved;
however it would be useful to reference the types of a CommonJS module from an ECMAScript module, or vice-versa.

TypeScript now allows `/// ` directives.



```id
ts/// <reference types="pkg" resolution-mode="require" />// or/// <reference types="pkg" resolution-mode="import" />
```



Additionally, in nightly versions of TypeScript, `import type` can specify an import assertion to achieve something similar.



```id
ts// Resolve `pkg` as if we were importing with a `require()`import type { TypeFromRequire } from "pkg" assert {    "resolution-mode": "require"};// Resolve `pkg` as if we were importing with an `import`import type { TypeFromImport } from "pkg" assert {    "resolution-mode": "import"};export interface MergedType extends TypeFromRequire, TypeFromImport {}
```



These import assertions can also be used on `import()` types.



```id
tsexport type TypeFromRequire =    import("pkg", { assert: { "resolution-mode": "require" } }).TypeFromRequire;export type TypeFromImport =    import("pkg", { assert: { "resolution-mode": "import" } }).TypeFromImport;export interface MergedType extends TypeFromRequire, TypeFromImport {}
```



The `import type` and `import()` syntaxes only support `resolution-mode` in nightly builds of TypeScript .
You’ll likely get an error like



```
Resolution mode assertions are unstable. Use nightly TypeScript to silence this error. Try updating with 'npm install -D typescript@next'.
```



If you do find yourself using this feature in nightly versions of TypeScript, consider providing feedback on this issue .

You can see the respective changes for reference directives and for type import assertions .

## Go to Source Definition

TypeScript 4.7 contains support for a new experimental editor command called Go To Source Definition .
It’s similar to Go To Definition , but it never returns results inside declaration files.
Instead, it tries to find corresponding implementation files (like `.js` or `.ts` files), and find definitions there — even if those files are normally shadowed by `.d.ts` files.

This comes in handy most often when you need to peek at the implementation of a function you’re importing from a library instead of its type declaration in a `.d.ts` file.

 

You can try this new command in the latest versions of Visual Studio Code.
Note, though, that this functionality is still in preview, and there are some known limitations.
In some cases TypeScript uses heuristics to guess which `.js` file corresponds to the given result of a definition, so these results might be inaccurate.
Visual Studio Code also doesn’t yet indicate whether a result was a guess, but it’s something we’re collaborating on.

You can leave feedback about the feature, read about known limitations, or learn more at our dedicated feedback issue .

## Group-Aware Organize Imports

TypeScript has an Organize Imports editor feature for both JavaScript and TypeScript.
Unfortunately, it could be a bit of a blunt instrument, and would often naively sort your import statements.

For instance, if you ran Organize Imports on the following file…



```id
ts// local codeimport * as bbb from "./bbb";import * as ccc from "./ccc";import * as aaa from "./aaa";// built-insimport * as path from "path";import * as child_process from "child_process"import * as fs from "fs";// some code...
```



You would get something like the following



```id
ts// local codeimport * as child_process from "child_process";import * as fs from "fs";// built-insimport * as path from "path";import * as aaa from "./aaa";import * as bbb from "./bbb";import * as ccc from "./ccc";// some code...
```



This is… not ideal.
Sure, our imports are sorted by their paths, and our comments and newlines are preserved, but not in a way we expected.
Much of the time, if we have our imports grouped in a specific way, then we want to keep them that way.

TypeScript 4.7 performs Organize Imports in a group-aware manner.
Running it on the above code looks a little bit more like what you’d expect:



```id
ts// local codeimport * as aaa from "./aaa";import * as bbb from "./bbb";import * as ccc from "./ccc";// built-insimport * as child_process from "child_process";import * as fs from "fs";import * as path from "path";// some code...
```



We’d like to extend our thanks to Minh Quy who provided this feature .

## Object Method Snippet Completions

TypeScript now provides snippet completions for object literal methods.
When completing members in an object, TypeScript will provide a typical completion entry for just the name of a method, along with a separate completion entry for the full method definition!

 

For more details, see the implementing pull request .

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Updates

While TypeScript strives to avoid major breaks, even small changes in the built-in libraries can cause issues.
We don’t expect major breaks as a result of DOM and `lib.d.ts` updates, but there may be some small ones.

### Stricter Spread Checks in JSX

When writing a `...spread` in JSX, TypeScript now enforces stricter checks that the given type is actually an object.
As a result, values with the types `unknown` and `never` (and more rarely, just bare `null` and `undefined`) can no longer be spread into JSX elements.

So for the following example:



```id
tsximport * as React from "react";interface Props {    stuff?: string;}function MyComponent(props: unknown) {    return <div {...props} />;}
```



you’ll now receive an error like the following:



```
Spread types may only be created from object types.
```



This makes this behavior more consistent with spreads in object literals.

For more details, see the change on GitHub .

### Stricter Checks with Template String Expressions

When a `symbol` value is used in a template string, it will trigger a runtime error in JavaScript.



```id
jslet str = `hello ${Symbol()}`;// TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string
```



As a result, TypeScript will issue an error as well;
however, TypeScript now also checks if a generic value that is constrained to a symbol in some way is used in a template string.



```id
tsfunction logKey<S extends string | symbol>(key: S): S {    // Now an error.    console.log(`${key} is the key`);    return key;}function get<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {    // Now an error.    console.log(`Grabbing property '${key}'.`);    return obj[key];}
```



TypeScript will now issue the following error:



```
Implicit conversion of a 'symbol' to a 'string' will fail at runtime. Consider wrapping this expression in 'String(...)'.
```



In some cases, you can get around this by wrapping the expression in a call to `String`, just like the error message suggests.



```id
tsfunction logKey<S extends string | symbol>(key: S): S {    // No longer an error.    console.log(`${String(key)} is the key`);    return key;}
```



In others, this error is too pedantic, and you might not ever care to even allow `symbol` keys when using `keyof`.
In such cases, you can switch to `string & keyof ...`:



```id
tsfunction get<T, K extends string & keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {    // No longer an error.    console.log(`Grabbing property '${key}'.`);    return obj[key];}
```



For more information, you can see the implementing pull request .

### `readFile` Method is No Longer Optional on `LanguageServiceHost`

If you’re creating `LanguageService` instances, then provided `LanguageServiceHost`s will need to provide a `readFile` method.
This change was necessary to support the new `moduleDetection` compiler option.

You can read more on the change here .

### `readonly` Tuples Have a `readonly` `length` Property

A `readonly` tuple will now treat its `length` property as `readonly`.
This was almost never witnessable for fixed-length tuples, but was an oversight which could be observed for tuples with trailing optional and rest element types.

As a result, the following code will now fail:



```id
tsfunction overwriteLength(tuple: readonly [string, string, string]) {    // Now errors.    tuple.length = 7;}
```

# TypeScript 3.9

 

## Improvements in Inference and `Promise.all`

Recent versions of TypeScript (around 3.7) have had updates to the declarations of functions like `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`.
Unfortunately, that introduced a few regressions, especially when mixing in values with `null` or `undefined`.



```id
tsinterface Lion {  roar(): void;}interface Seal {  singKissFromARose(): void;}async function visitZoo(  lionExhibit: Promise<Lion>,  sealExhibit: Promise<Seal | undefined>) {  let [lion, seal] = await Promise.all([lionExhibit, sealExhibit]);  lion.roar(); // uh oh  //  ~~~~  // Object is possibly 'undefined'.}
```



This is strange behavior!
The fact that `sealExhibit` contained an `undefined` somehow poisoned type of `lion` to include `undefined`.

Thanks to a pull request from Jack Bates , this has been fixed with improvements in our inference process in TypeScript 3.9.
The above no longer errors.
If you’ve been stuck on older versions of TypeScript due to issues around `Promise`s, we encourage you to give 3.9 a shot!

### What About the `awaited` Type?

If you’ve been following our issue tracker and design meeting notes, you might be aware of some work around a new type operator called `awaited` .
This goal of this type operator is to accurately model the way that `Promise` unwrapping works in JavaScript.

We initially anticipated shipping `awaited` in TypeScript 3.9, but as we’ve run early TypeScript builds with existing codebases, we’ve realized that the feature needs more design work before we can roll it out to everyone smoothly.
As a result, we’ve decided to pull the feature out of our main branch until we feel more confident.
We’ll be experimenting more with the feature, but we won’t be shipping it as part of this release.

## Speed Improvements

TypeScript 3.9 ships with many new speed improvements.
Our team has been focusing on performance after observing extremely poor editing/compilation speed with packages like material-ui and styled-components.
We’ve dived deep here, with a series of different pull requests that optimize certain pathological cases involving large unions, intersections, conditional types, and mapped types.

 https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36576 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36590 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36607 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36622 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36754 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36696 

Each of these pull requests gains about a 5-10% reduction in compile times on certain codebases.
In total, we believe we’ve achieved around a 40% reduction in material-ui’s compile time!

We also have some changes to file renaming functionality in editor scenarios.
We heard from the Visual Studio Code team that when renaming a file, just figuring out which import statements needed to be updated could take between 5 to 10 seconds.
TypeScript 3.9 addresses this issue by changing the internals of how the compiler and language service caches file lookups .

While there’s still room for improvement, we hope this work translates to a snappier experience for everyone!

## `// @ts-expect-error` Comments

Imagine that we’re writing a library in TypeScript and we’re exporting some function called `doStuff` as part of our public API.
The function’s types declare that it takes two `string`s so that other TypeScript users can get type-checking errors, but it also does a runtime check (maybe only in development builds) to give JavaScript users a helpful error.



```id
tsfunction doStuff(abc: string, xyz: string) {  assert(typeof abc === "string");  assert(typeof xyz === "string");  // do some stuff}
```



So TypeScript users will get a helpful red squiggle and an error message when they misuse this function, and JavaScript users will get an assertion error.
We’d like to test this behavior, so we’ll write a unit test.



```id
tsexpect(() => {  doStuff(123, 456);}).toThrow();
```



Unfortunately if our tests are written in TypeScript, TypeScript will give us an error!



```id
tsdoStuff(123, 456);//          ~~~// error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```



That’s why TypeScript 3.9 brings a new feature: `// @ts-expect-error` comments.
When a line is preceded by a `// @ts-expect-error` comment, TypeScript will suppress that error from being reported;
but if there’s no error, TypeScript will report that `// @ts-expect-error` wasn’t necessary.

As a quick example, the following code is okay



```id
ts// @ts-expect-errorconsole.log(47 * "octopus");
```



while the following code



```id
ts// @ts-expect-errorconsole.log(1 + 1);
```



results in the error



```
Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive.
```



We’d like to extend a big thanks to Josh Goldberg , the contributor who implemented this feature.
For more information, you can take a look at the `ts-expect-error` pull request .

### `ts-ignore` or `ts-expect-error`?

In some ways `// @ts-expect-error` can act as a suppression comment, similar to `// @ts-ignore`.
The difference is that `// @ts-ignore` will do nothing if the following line is error-free.

You might be tempted to switch existing `// @ts-ignore` comments over to `// @ts-expect-error`, and you might be wondering which is appropriate for future code.
While it’s entirely up to you and your team, we have some ideas of which to pick in certain situations.

Pick `ts-expect-error` if:

- you’re writing test code where you actually want the type system to error on an operation

- you expect a fix to be coming in fairly quickly and you just need a quick workaround

- you’re in a reasonably-sized project with a proactive team that wants to remove suppression comments as soon as affected code is valid again

Pick `ts-ignore` if:

- you have a larger project and new errors have appeared in code with no clear owner

- you are in the middle of an upgrade between two different versions of TypeScript, and a line of code errors in one version but not another.

- you honestly don’t have the time to decide which of these options is better.

## Uncalled Function Checks in Conditional Expressions

In TypeScript 3.7 we introduced uncalled function checks to report an error when you’ve forgotten to call a function.



```id
tsfunction hasImportantPermissions(): boolean {  // ...}// Oops!if (hasImportantPermissions) {  //  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  // This condition will always return true since the function is always defined.  // Did you mean to call it instead?  deleteAllTheImportantFiles();}
```



However, this error only applied to conditions in `if` statements.
Thanks to a pull request from Alexander Tarasyuk , this feature is also now supported in ternary conditionals (i.e. the `cond ? trueExpr : falseExpr` syntax).



```id
tsdeclare function listFilesOfDirectory(dirPath: string): string[];declare function isDirectory(): boolean;function getAllFiles(startFileName: string) {  const result: string[] = [];  traverse(startFileName);  return result;  function traverse(currentPath: string) {    return isDirectory      ? //     ~~~~~~~~~~~        // This condition will always return true        // since the function is always defined.        // Did you mean to call it instead?        listFilesOfDirectory(currentPath).forEach(traverse)      : result.push(currentPath);  }}
```



 https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/36048 

## Editor Improvements

The TypeScript compiler not only powers the TypeScript editing experience in most major editors, it also powers the JavaScript experience in the Visual Studio family of editors and more.
Using new TypeScript/JavaScript functionality in your editor will differ depending on your editor, but

- Visual Studio Code supports selecting different versions of TypeScript . Alternatively, there’s the JavaScript/TypeScript Nightly Extension to stay on the bleeding edge (which is typically very stable).

- Visual Studio 2017/2019 have [the SDK installers above] and MSBuild installs .

- Sublime Text 3 supports selecting different versions of TypeScript 

### CommonJS Auto-Imports in JavaScript

One great new improvement is in auto-imports in JavaScript files using CommonJS modules.

In older versions, TypeScript always assumed that regardless of your file, you wanted an ECMAScript-style import like



```id
jsimport * as fs from "fs";
```



However, not everyone is targeting ECMAScript-style modules when writing JavaScript files.
Plenty of users still use CommonJS-style `require(...)` imports like so



```id
jsconst fs = require("fs");
```



TypeScript now automatically detects the types of imports you’re using to keep your file’s style clean and consistent.

 

For more details on the change, see the corresponding pull request .

### Code Actions Preserve Newlines

TypeScript’s refactorings and quick fixes often didn’t do a great job of preserving newlines.
As a really basic example, take the following code.



```id
tsconst maxValue = 100;/*start*/for (let i = 0; i <= maxValue; i++) {  // First get the squared value.  let square = i ** 2;  // Now print the squared value.  console.log(square);}/*end*/
```



If we highlighted the range from `/*start*/` to `/*end*/` in our editor to extract to a new function, we’d end up with code like the following.



```id
tsconst maxValue = 100;printSquares();function printSquares() {  for (let i = 0; i <= maxValue; i++) {    // First get the squared value.    let square = i ** 2;    // Now print the squared value.    console.log(square);  }}
```



 

That’s not ideal - we had a blank line between each statement in our `for` loop, but the refactoring got rid of it!
TypeScript 3.9 does a little more work to preserve what we write.



```id
tsconst maxValue = 100;printSquares();function printSquares() {  for (let i = 0; i <= maxValue; i++) {    // First get the squared value.    let square = i ** 2;    // Now print the squared value.    console.log(square);  }}
```



 

You can see more about the implementation in this pull request 

### Quick Fixes for Missing Return Expressions

There are occasions where we might forget to return the value of the last statement in a function, especially when adding curly braces to arrow functions.



```id
ts// beforelet f1 = () => 42;// oops - not the same!let f2 = () => {  42;};
```



Thanks to a pull request from community member Wenlu Wang , TypeScript can provide a quick-fix to add missing `return` statements, remove curly braces, or add parentheses to arrow function bodies that look suspiciously like object literals.

 

### Support for “Solution Style” `tsconfig.json` Files

Editors need to figure out which configuration file a file belongs to so that it can apply the appropriate options and figure out which other files are included in the current “project”.
By default, editors powered by TypeScript’s language server do this by walking up each parent directory to find a `tsconfig.json`.

One case where this slightly fell over is when a `tsconfig.json` simply existed to reference other `tsconfig.json` files.



```
// tsconfig.json{  "files": [],  "references": [    { "path": "./tsconfig.shared.json" },    { "path": "./tsconfig.frontend.json" },    { "path": "./tsconfig.backend.json" }  ]}
```



This file that really does nothing but manage other project files is often called a “solution” in some environments.
Here, none of these `tsconfig.*.json` files get picked up by the server, but we’d really like the language server to understand that the current `.ts` file probably belongs to one of the mentioned projects in this root `tsconfig.json`.

TypeScript 3.9 adds support to editing scenarios for this configuration.
For more details, take a look at the pull request that added this functionality .

## Breaking Changes

### Parsing Differences in Optional Chaining and Non-Null Assertions

TypeScript recently implemented the optional chaining operator, but we’ve received user feedback that the behavior of optional chaining (`?.`) with the non-null assertion operator (`!`) is extremely counter-intuitive.

Specifically, in previous versions, the code



```id
tsfoo?.bar!.baz;
```



was interpreted to be equivalent to the following JavaScript.



```id
js(foo?.bar).baz;
```



In the above code the parentheses stop the “short-circuiting” behavior of optional chaining, so if `foo` is `undefined`, accessing `baz` will cause a runtime error.

The Babel team who pointed this behavior out, and most users who provided feedback to us, believe that this behavior is wrong.
We do too!
The thing we heard the most was that the `!` operator should just “disappear” since the intent was to remove `null` and `undefined` from the type of `bar`.

In other words, most people felt that the original snippet should be interpreted as



```id
jsfoo?.bar.baz;
```



which just evaluates to `undefined` when `foo` is `undefined`.

This is a breaking change, but we believe most code was written with the new interpretation in mind.
Users who want to revert to the old behavior can add explicit parentheses around the left side of the `!` operator.



```id
tsfoo?.bar!.baz;
```



### `}` and `>` are Now Invalid JSX Text Characters

The JSX Specification forbids the use of the `}` and `>` characters in text positions.
TypeScript and Babel have both decided to enforce this rule to be more conformant.
The new way to insert these characters is to use an HTML escape code (e.g. ` 2 &gt 1 `) or insert an expression with a string literal (e.g. ` 2 {">"} 1 `).

Luckily, thanks to the pull request enforcing this from Brad Zacher , you’ll get an error message along the lines of



```
Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'>'}` or `>`?Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'}'}` or `&rbrace;`?
```



For example:



```id
tsxlet directions = <span>Navigate to: Menu Bar > Tools > Options</span>;//                                           ~       ~// Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'>'}` or `>`?
```



That error message came with a handy quick fix, and thanks to Alexander Tarasyuk , you can apply these changes in bulk if you have a lot of errors.

### Stricter Checks on Intersections and Optional Properties

Generally, an intersection type like `A & B` is assignable to `C` if either `A` or `B` is assignable to `C`; however, sometimes that has problems with optional properties.
For example, take the following:



```id
tsinterface A {  a: number; // notice this is 'number'}interface B {  b: string;}interface C {  a?: boolean; // notice this is 'boolean'  b: string;}declare let x: A & B;declare let y: C;y = x;
```



In previous versions of TypeScript, this was allowed because while `A` was totally incompatible with `C`, `B` was compatible with `C`.

In TypeScript 3.9, so long as every type in an intersection is a concrete object type, the type system will consider all of the properties at once.
As a result, TypeScript will see that the `a` property of `A & B` is incompatible with that of `C`:



```
Type 'A & B' is not assignable to type 'C'.  Types of property 'a' are incompatible.    Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'boolean | undefined'.
```



For more information on this change, see the corresponding pull request .

### Intersections Reduced By Discriminant Properties

There are a few cases where you might end up with types that describe values that just don’t exist.
For example



```id
tsdeclare function smushObjects<T, U>(x: T, y: U): T & U;interface Circle {  kind: "circle";  radius: number;}interface Square {  kind: "square";  sideLength: number;}declare let x: Circle;declare let y: Square;let z = smushObjects(x, y);console.log(z.kind);
```



This code is slightly weird because there’s really no way to create an intersection of a `Circle` and a `Square` - they have two incompatible `kind` fields.
In previous versions of TypeScript, this code was allowed and the type of `kind` itself was `never` because `"circle" & "square"` described a set of values that could `never` exist.

In TypeScript 3.9, the type system is more aggressive here - it notices that it’s impossible to intersect `Circle` and `Square` because of their `kind` properties.
So instead of collapsing the type of `z.kind` to `never`, it collapses the type of `z` itself (`Circle & Square`) to `never`.
That means the above code now errors with:



```
Property 'kind' does not exist on type 'never'.
```



Most of the breaks we observed seem to correspond with slightly incorrect type declarations.
For more details, see the original pull request .

### Getters/Setters are No Longer Enumerable

In older versions of TypeScript, `get` and `set` accessors in classes were emitted in a way that made them enumerable; however, this wasn’t compliant with the ECMAScript specification which states that they must be non-enumerable.
As a result, TypeScript code that targeted ES5 and ES2015 could differ in behavior.

Thanks to a pull request from GitHub user pathurs , TypeScript 3.9 now conforms more closely with ECMAScript in this regard.

### Type Parameters That Extend `any` No Longer Act as `any`

In previous versions of TypeScript, a type parameter constrained to `any` could be treated as `any`.



```id
tsfunction foo<T extends any>(arg: T) {  arg.spfjgerijghoied; // no error!}
```



This was an oversight, so TypeScript 3.9 takes a more conservative approach and issues an error on these questionable operations.



```id
tsfunction foo<T extends any>(arg: T) {  arg.spfjgerijghoied;  //  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  // Property 'spfjgerijghoied' does not exist on type 'T'.}
```



### `export *` is Always Retained

In previous TypeScript versions, declarations like `export * from "foo"` would be dropped in our JavaScript output if `foo` didn’t export any values.
This sort of emit is problematic because it’s type-directed and can’t be emulated by Babel.
TypeScript 3.9 will always emit these `export *` declarations.
In practice, we don’t expect this to break much existing code.

### More libdom.d.ts refinements

We are continuing to move more of TypeScript’s built-in .d.ts library (lib.d.ts and family) to be generated from Web IDL files directly from the DOM specification.
As a result some vendor-specific types related to media access have been removed.

Adding this file to an ambient `*.d.ts` to your project will bring them back:

 


```id
tsinterface AudioTrackList {     [Symbol.iterator](): IterableIterator<AudioTrack>; }interface HTMLVideoElement {  readonly audioTracks: AudioTrackList  msFrameStep(forward: boolean): void;  msInsertVideoEffect(activatableClassId: string, effectRequired: boolean, config?: any): void;  msSetVideoRectangle(left: number, top: number, right: number, bottom: number): void;  webkitEnterFullScreen(): void;  webkitEnterFullscreen(): void;  webkitExitFullScreen(): void;  webkitExitFullscreen(): void;  msHorizontalMirror: boolean;  readonly msIsLayoutOptimalForPlayback: boolean;  readonly msIsStereo3D: boolean;  msStereo3DPackingMode: string;  msStereo3DRenderMode: string;  msZoom: boolean;  onMSVideoFormatChanged: ((this: HTMLVideoElement, ev: Event) => any) | null;  onMSVideoFrameStepCompleted: ((this: HTMLVideoElement, ev: Event) => any) | null;  onMSVideoOptimalLayoutChanged: ((this: HTMLVideoElement, ev: Event) => any) | null;  webkitDisplayingFullscreen: boolean;  webkitSupportsFullscreen: boolean;}interface MediaError {  readonly msExtendedCode: number;  readonly MS_MEDIA_ERR_ENCRYPTED: number;}
```

# TypeScript 4.6

 

## Allowing Code in Constructors Before `super()`

In JavaScript classes it’s mandatory to call `super()` before referring to `this`.
TypeScript enforces this as well, though it was a bit too strict in how it ensured this.
In TypeScript, it was previously an error to contain any code at the beginning of a constructor if its containing class had any property initializers.



```id
tsclass Base {  // ...}class Derived extends Base {  someProperty = true;  constructor() {    // error!    // have to call 'super()' first because it needs to initialize 'someProperty'.    doSomeStuff();    super();  }}
```



This made it cheap to check that `super()` gets called before `this` is referenced, but it ended up rejecting a lot of valid code.
TypeScript 4.6 is now much more lenient in that check and permits other code to run before `super()`., all while still ensuring that `super()` occurs at the top-level before any references to `this`.

We’d like to extend our thanks to Joshua Goldberg for patiently working with us to land this change !

## Control Flow Analysis for Destructured Discriminated Unions

TypeScript is able to narrow types based on what’s called a discriminant property.
For example, in the following code snippet, TypeScript is able to narrow the type of `action` based on every time we check against the value of `kind`.



```id
tstype Action =  | { kind: "NumberContents"; payload: number }  | { kind: "StringContents"; payload: string };function processAction(action: Action) {  if (action.kind === "NumberContents") {    // `action.payload` is a number here.    let num = action.payload * 2;    // ...  } else if (action.kind === "StringContents") {    // `action.payload` is a string here.    const str = action.payload.trim();    // ...  }}
```



This lets us work with objects that can hold different data, but a common field tells us which data those objects have.

This is very common in TypeScript; however, depending on your preferences, you might have wanted to destructure `kind` and `payload` in the example above.
Perhaps something like the following:



```id
tstype Action =  | { kind: "NumberContents"; payload: number }  | { kind: "StringContents"; payload: string };function processAction(action: Action) {  const { kind, payload } = action;  if (kind === "NumberContents") {    let num = payload * 2;    // ...  } else if (kind === "StringContents") {    const str = payload.trim();    // ...  }}
```



Previously TypeScript would error on these - once `kind` and `payload` were extracted from the same object into variables, they were considered totally independent.

In TypeScript 4.6, this just works!

When destructuring individual properties into a `const` declaration, or when destructuring a parameter into variables that are never assigned to, TypeScript will check for if the destructured type is a discriminated union.
If it is, TypeScript can now narrow the types of variables depending on checks of other variables
So in our example, a check on `kind` narrows the type of `payload`.

For more information, see the pull request that implemented this analysis .

## Improved Recursion Depth Checks

TypeScript has some interesting challenges due to the fact that it’s built on a structural type system that also provides generics.

In a structural type system, object types are compatible based on the members they have.



```id
tsinterface Source {  prop: string;}interface Target {  prop: number;}function check(source: Source, target: Target) {  target = source;  // error!  // Type 'Source' is not assignable to type 'Target'.  //   Types of property 'prop' are incompatible.  //     Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.}
```



Notice that whether or not `Source` is compatible with `Target` has to do with whether their properties are assignable.
In this case, that’s just `prop`.

When you introduce generics into this, there are some harder questions to answer.
For instance, is a `Source ` assignable to a `Target ` in the following case?



```id
tsinterface Source<T> {  prop: Source<Source<T>>;}interface Target<T> {  prop: Target<Target<T>>;}function check(source: Source<string>, target: Target<number>) {  target = source;}
```



In order to answer that, TypeScript needs to check whether the types of `prop` are compatible.
That leads to the another question: is a `Source >` assignable to a `Target >`?
To answer that, TypeScript checks whether `prop` is compatible for those types, and ends up checking whether `Source >>` is assignable to `Target >>`.
Keep going for a bit, and you might notice that the type infinitely expands the more you dig in.

TypeScript has a few heuristics here - if a type appears to be infinitely expanding after encountering a certain depth check, then it considers that the types could be compatible.
This is usually enough, but embarrassingly there were some false-negatives that this wouldn’t catch.



```id
tsinterface Foo<T> {  prop: T;}declare let x: Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<string>>>>>>;declare let y: Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<Foo<string>>>>>;x = y;
```



A human reader can see that `x` and `y` should be incompatible in the above example.
While the types are deeply nested, that’s just a consequence of how they were declared.
The heuristic was meant to capture cases where deeply-nested types were generated through exploring the types, not from when a developer wrote that type out themselves.

TypeScript 4.6 is now able to distinguish these cases, and correctly errors on the last example.
Additionally, because the language is no longer concerned with false-positives from explicitly-written types, TypeScript can conclude that a type is infinitely expanding much earlier, and save a bunch of work in checking for type compatibility.
As a result, libraries on DefinitelyTyped like `redux-immutable`, `react-lazylog`, and `yup` saw a 50% reduction in check-time.

You may already have this change because it was cherry-picked into TypeScript 4.5.3, but it is a notable feature of TypeScript 4.6 which you can read up more about here .

## Indexed Access Inference Improvements

TypeScript now can correctly infer to indexed access types which immediately index into a mapped object type.



```id
tsinterface TypeMap {  number: number;  string: string;  boolean: boolean;}type UnionRecord<P extends keyof TypeMap> = {  [K in P]: {    kind: K;    v: TypeMap[K];    f: (p: TypeMap[K]) => void;  };}[P];function processRecord<K extends keyof TypeMap>(record: UnionRecord<K>) {  record.f(record.v);}// This call used to have issues - now works!processRecord({  kind: "string",  v: "hello!",  // 'val' used to implicitly have the type 'string | number | boolean',  // but now is correctly inferred to just 'string'.  f: (val) => {    console.log(val.toUpperCase());  },});
```



This pattern was already supported and allowed TypeScript to understand that the call to `record.f(record.v)` is valid, but previously the call to `processRecord` would give poor inference results for `val`

TypeScript 4.6 improves this so that no type assertions are necessary within the call to `processRecord`.

For more information, you can read up on the pull request .

## Control Flow Analysis for Dependent Parameters

A signature can be declared with a rest parameter whose type is a discriminated union of tuples.



```id
tsfunction func(...args: ["str", string] | ["num", number]) {  // ...}
```



What this says is that the arguments to `func` depends entirely on the first argument.
When the first argument is the string `"str"`, then its second argument has to be a `string`.
When its first argument is the string `"num"`, its second argument has to be a `number`.

In cases where TypeScript infers the type of a function from a signature like this, TypeScript can now narrow parameters that depend on each other.



```id
tstype Func = (...args: ["a", number] | ["b", string]) => void;const f1: Func = (kind, payload) => {  if (kind === "a") {    payload.toFixed(); // 'payload' narrowed to 'number'  }  if (kind === "b") {    payload.toUpperCase(); // 'payload' narrowed to 'string'  }};f1("a", 42);f1("b", "hello");
```



For more information, see the change on GitHub .

## `--target es2022`

TypeScript’s `--target` option now supports `es2022`.
This means features like class fields now have a stable output target where they can be preserved.
It also means that new built-in functionality like the `at()` method on `Array`s , `Object.hasOwn` , or the `cause` option on `new Error` can be used either with this new `--target` setting, or with `--lib es2022`.

This functionality was implemented by Kagami Sascha Rosylight (saschanaz) over several PRs, and we’re grateful for that contribution!

## Removed Unnecessary Arguments in `react-jsx`

Previously, when compiling code like the following in `--jsx react-jsx`



```id
tsxexport const el = <div>foo</div>;
```



TypeScript would produce the following JavaScript code:



```id
jsximport { jsx as _jsx } from "react/jsx-runtime";export const el = _jsx("div", { children: "foo" }, void 0);
```



That last `void 0` argument is unnecessary in this emit mode, and removing it can improve bundle sizes.



```id
diff- export const el = _jsx("div", { children: "foo" }, void 0);+ export const el = _jsx("div", { children: "foo" });
```



Thanks to a pull request from Alexander Tarasyuk , TypeScript 4.6 now drops the `void 0` argument.

## JSDoc Name Suggestions

In JSDoc, you can document parameters using an `@param` tag.



```id
js/** * @param x The first operand * @param y The second operand */function add(x, y) {  return x + y;}
```



But what happens when these comments fall out of date?
What if we rename `x` and `y` to `a` and `b`?



```id
js/** * @param x {number} The first operand * @param y {number} The second operand */function add(a, b) {  return a + b;}
```



Previously TypeScript would only tell you about this when performing type-checking on JavaScript files - when using either the `checkJs` option, or adding a `// @ts-check` comment to the top of your file.

You can now get similar information for TypeScript files in your editor!
TypeScript now provides suggestions for when parameter names don’t match between your function and its JSDoc comment.

## More Syntax and Binding Errors in JavaScript

TypeScript has expanded its set of syntax and binding errors in JavaScript files.
You’ll see these new errors if you open JavaScript files in an editor like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, or if you run JavaScript code through the TypeScript compiler - even if you don’t turn on `checkJs` or add a `// @ts-check` comment to the top of your files.

As one example, if you have two declarations of a `const` in the same scope of a JavaScript file, TypeScript will now issue an error on those declarations.



```id
tsconst foo = 1234;//    ~~~// error: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'foo'.// ...const foo = 5678;//    ~~~// error: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'foo'.
```



As another example, TypeScript will let you know if a modifier is being incorrectly used.



```id
tsfunction container() {    export function foo() {//  ~~~~~~// error: Modifiers cannot appear here.    }}
```



These errors can be disabled by adding a `// @ts-nocheck` at the top of your file, but we’re interested in hearing some early feedback about how it works for your JavaScript workflow.
You can easily try it out for Visual Studio Code by installing the TypeScript and JavaScript Nightly Extension , and read up more on the first and second pull requests.

## TypeScript Trace Analyzer

Occasionally, teams may encounter types that are computationally expensive to create and compare against other types.
 TypeScript has a `--generateTrace` flag to help identify some of those expensive types, or sometimes help diagnose issues in the TypeScript compiler.
While the information generated by `--generateTrace` can be useful (especially with some information added in TypeScript 4.6), it can often be hard to read in existing trace visualizers.

We recently published a tool called @typescript/analyze-trace to get a more digestible view of this information.
While we don’t expect everyone to need `analyze-trace`, we think it can come in handy for any team that is running into build performance issues with TypeScript .

For more information, see the `analyze-trace` tool’s repo .

## Breaking Changes

### Object Rests Drop Unspreadable Members from Generic Objects

Object rest expressions now drop members that appear to be unspreadable on generic objects.
In the following example…



```id
tsclass Thing {  someProperty = 42;  someMethod() {    // ...  }}function foo<T extends Thing>(x: T) {  let { someProperty, ...rest } = x;  // Used to work, is now an error!  // Property 'someMethod' does not exist on type 'Omit<T, "someProperty" | "someMethod">'.  rest.someMethod();}
```



the variable `rest` used to have the type `Omit ` because TypeScript would strictly analyze which other properties were destructured.
This doesn’t model how `...rest` would work in a destructuring from a non-generic type because `someMethod` would typically be dropped as well.
In TypeScript 4.6, the type of `rest` is `Omit `.

This can also come up in cases when destructuring from `this`.
When destructuring `this` using a `...rest` element, unspreadable and non-public members are now dropped, which is consistent with destructuring instances of a class in other places.



```id
tsclass Thing {  someProperty = 42;  someMethod() {    // ...  }  someOtherMethod() {    let { someProperty, ...rest } = this;    // Used to work, is now an error!    // Property 'someMethod' does not exist on type 'Omit<T, "someProperty" | "someMethod">'.    rest.someMethod();  }}
```



For more details, see the corresponding change here .

### JavaScript Files Always Receive Grammar and Binding Errors

Previously, TypeScript would ignore most grammar errors in JavaScript apart from accidentally using TypeScript syntax in a JavaScript file.
TypeScript now shows JavaScript syntax and binding errors in your file, such as using incorrect modifiers, duplicate declarations, and more.
These will typically be most apparent in Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio, but can also occur when running JavaScript code through the TypeScript compiler.

You can explicitly turn these errors off by inserting a `// @ts-nocheck` comment at the top of your file.

For more information, see the first and second implementing pull requests for these features.

### TypeScript: Documentation - TypeScript 3.8

# TypeScript 3.8

 

## Type-Only Imports and Export

This feature is something most users may never have to think about; however, if you’ve hit issues under `isolatedModules` , TypeScript’s `transpileModule` API, or Babel, this feature might be relevant.

TypeScript 3.8 adds a new syntax for type-only imports and exports.



```id
tsimport type { SomeThing } from "./some-module.js";export type { SomeThing };
```



`import type` only imports declarations to be used for type annotations and declarations.
It always gets fully erased, so there’s no remnant of it at runtime.
Similarly, `export type` only provides an export that can be used for type contexts, and is also erased from TypeScript’s output.

It’s important to note that classes have a value at runtime and a type at design-time, and the use is context-sensitive.
When using `import type` to import a class, you can’t do things like extend from it.



```id
tsimport type { Component } from "react";interface ButtonProps {  // ...}class Button extends Component<ButtonProps> {  //               ~~~~~~~~~  // error! 'Component' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.  // ...}
```



If you’ve used Flow before, the syntax is fairly similar.
One difference is that we’ve added a few restrictions to avoid code that might appear ambiguous.



```id
ts// Is only 'Foo' a type? Or every declaration in the import?// We just give an error because it's not clear.import type Foo, { Bar, Baz } from "some-module";//     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// error! A type-only import can specify a default import or named bindings, but not both.
```



In conjunction with `import type`, TypeScript 3.8 also adds a new compiler flag to control what happens with imports that won’t be utilized at runtime: `importsNotUsedAsValues` .
This flag takes 3 different values:

 `remove`: this is today’s behavior of dropping these imports. It’s going to continue to be the default, and is a non-breaking change.

- `preserve`: this preserves all imports whose values are never used. This can cause imports/side-effects to be preserved.

- `error`: this preserves all imports (the same as the `preserve` option), but will error when a value import is only used as a type. This might be useful if you want to ensure no values are being accidentally imported, but still make side-effect imports explicit.

For more information about the feature, you can take a look at the pull request , and relevant changes around broadening where imports from an `import type` declaration can be used.

## ECMAScript Private Fields

TypeScript 3.8 brings support for ECMAScript’s private fields, part of the stage-3 class fields proposal .



```id
tsclass Person {  #name: string;  constructor(name: string) {    this.#name = name;  }  greet() {    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.#name}!`);  }}let jeremy = new Person("Jeremy Bearimy");jeremy.#name;//     ~~~~~// Property '#name' is not accessible outside class 'Person'// because it has a private identifier.
```



Unlike regular properties (even ones declared with the `private` modifier), private fields have a few rules to keep in mind.
Some of them are:

- Private fields start with a `#` character. Sometimes we call these private names .

- Every private field name is uniquely scoped to its containing class.

- TypeScript accessibility modifiers like `public` or `private` can’t be used on private fields.

- Private fields can’t be accessed or even detected outside of the containing class - even by JS users! Sometimes we call this hard privacy .

Apart from “hard” privacy, another benefit of private fields is that uniqueness we just mentioned.
For example, regular property declarations are prone to being overwritten in subclasses.



```id
tsclass C {  foo = 10;  cHelper() {    return this.foo;  }}class D extends C {  foo = 20;  dHelper() {    return this.foo;  }}let instance = new D();// 'this.foo' refers to the same property on each instance.console.log(instance.cHelper()); // prints '20'console.log(instance.dHelper()); // prints '20'
```



With private fields, you’ll never have to worry about this, since each field name is unique to the containing class.



```id
tsclass C {  #foo = 10;  cHelper() {    return this.#foo;  }}class D extends C {  #foo = 20;  dHelper() {    return this.#foo;  }}let instance = new D();// 'this.#foo' refers to a different field within each class.console.log(instance.cHelper()); // prints '10'console.log(instance.dHelper()); // prints '20'
```



Another thing worth noting is that accessing a private field on any other type will result in a `TypeError`!



```id
tsclass Square {  #sideLength: number;  constructor(sideLength: number) {    this.#sideLength = sideLength;  }  equals(other: any) {    return this.#sideLength === other.#sideLength;  }}const a = new Square(100);const b = { sideLength: 100 };// Boom!// TypeError: attempted to get private field on non-instance// This fails because 'b' is not an instance of 'Square'.console.log(a.equals(b));
```



Finally, for any plain `.js` file users, private fields always have to be declared before they’re assigned to.



```id
jsclass C {  // No declaration for '#foo'  // :(  constructor(foo: number) {    // SyntaxError!    // '#foo' needs to be declared before writing to it.    this.#foo = foo;  }}
```



JavaScript has always allowed users to access undeclared properties, whereas TypeScript has always required declarations for class properties.
With private fields, declarations are always needed regardless of whether we’re working in `.js` or `.ts` files.



```id
jsclass C {  /** @type {number} */  #foo;  constructor(foo: number) {    // This works.    this.#foo = foo;  }}
```



For more information about the implementation, you can check out the original pull request 

### Which should I use?

We’ve already received many questions on which type of privates you should use as a TypeScript user: most commonly, “should I use the `private` keyword, or ECMAScript’s hash/pound (`#`) private fields?”
It depends!

When it comes to properties, TypeScript’s `private` modifiers are fully erased - that means that at runtime, it acts entirely like a normal property and there’s no way to tell that it was declared with a `private` modifier. When using the `private` keyword, privacy is only enforced at compile-time/design-time, and for JavaScript consumers it’s entirely intent-based.



```id
tsclass C {  private foo = 10;}// This is an error at compile time,// but when TypeScript outputs .js files,// it'll run fine and print '10'.console.log(new C().foo); // prints '10'//                  ~~~// error! Property 'foo' is private and only accessible within class 'C'.// TypeScript allows this at compile-time// as a "work-around" to avoid the error.console.log(new C()["foo"]); // prints '10'
```



The upside is that this sort of “soft privacy” can help your consumers temporarily work around not having access to some API, and also works in any runtime.

On the other hand, ECMAScript’s `#` privates are completely inaccessible outside of the class.



```id
tsclass C {  #foo = 10;}console.log(new C().#foo); // SyntaxError//                  ~~~~// TypeScript reports an error *and*// this won't work at runtime!console.log(new C()["#foo"]); // prints undefined//          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~// TypeScript reports an error under 'noImplicitAny',// and this prints 'undefined'.
```



This hard privacy is really useful for strictly ensuring that nobody can take use of any of your internals.
If you’re a library author, removing or renaming a private field should never cause a breaking change.

As we mentioned, another benefit is that subclassing can be easier with ECMAScript’s `#` privates because they really are private.
When using ECMAScript `#` private fields, no subclass ever has to worry about collisions in field naming.
When it comes to TypeScript’s `private` property declarations, users still have to be careful not to trample over properties declared in superclasses.

One more thing to think about is where you intend for your code to run.
TypeScript currently can’t support this feature unless targeting ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) targets or higher.
This is because our downleveled implementation uses `WeakMap`s to enforce privacy, and `WeakMap`s can’t be polyfilled in a way that doesn’t cause memory leaks.
In contrast, TypeScript’s `private`-declared properties work with all targets - even ECMAScript 3!

A final consideration might be speed: `private` properties are no different from any other property, so accessing them is as fast as any other property access no matter which runtime you target.
In contrast, because `#` private fields are downleveled using `WeakMap`s, they may be slower to use.
While some runtimes might optimize their actual implementations of `#` private fields, and even have speedy `WeakMap` implementations, that might not be the case in all runtimes.

## `export * as ns` Syntax

It’s often common to have a single entry-point that exposes all the members of another module as a single member.



```id
tsimport * as utilities from "./utilities.js";export { utilities };
```



This is so common that ECMAScript 2020 recently added a new syntax to support this pattern!



```id
tsexport * as utilities from "./utilities.js";
```



This is a nice quality-of-life improvement to JavaScript, and TypeScript 3.8 implements this syntax.
When your module target is earlier than `es2020`, TypeScript will output something along the lines of the first code snippet.

## Top-Level `await`

TypeScript 3.8 provides support for a handy upcoming ECMAScript feature called “top-level `await`“.

JavaScript users often introduce an `async` function in order to use `await`, and then immediately called the function after defining it.



```id
jsasync function main() {  const response = await fetch("...");  const greeting = await response.text();  console.log(greeting);}main().catch((e) => console.error(e));
```



This is because previously in JavaScript (along with most other languages with a similar feature), `await` was only allowed within the body of an `async` function.
However, with top-level `await`, we can use `await` at the top level of a module.



```id
tsconst response = await fetch("...");const greeting = await response.text();console.log(greeting);// Make sure we're a moduleexport {};
```



Note there’s a subtlety: top-level `await` only works at the top level of a module , and files are only considered modules when TypeScript finds an `import` or an `export`.
In some basic cases, you might need to write out `export {}` as some boilerplate to make sure of this.

Top level `await` may not work in all environments where you might expect at this point.
Currently, you can only use top level `await` when the `target` compiler option is `es2017` or above, and `module` is `esnext` or `system`.
Support within several environments and bundlers may be limited or may require enabling experimental support.

For more information on our implementation, you can check out the original pull request .

## `es2020` for `target` and `module`

TypeScript 3.8 supports `es2020` as an option for `module` and `target` .
This will preserve newer ECMAScript 2020 features like optional chaining, nullish coalescing, `export * as ns`, and dynamic `import(...)` syntax.
It also means `bigint` literals now have a stable `target` below `esnext`.

## JSDoc Property Modifiers

TypeScript 3.8 supports JavaScript files by turning on the `allowJs` flag, and also supports type-checking those JavaScript files via the `checkJs` option or by adding a `// @ts-check` comment to the top of your `.js` files.

Because JavaScript files don’t have dedicated syntax for type-checking, TypeScript leverages JSDoc.
TypeScript 3.8 understands a few new JSDoc tags for properties.

First are the accessibility modifiers: `@public`, `@private`, and `@protected`.
These tags work exactly like `public`, `private`, and `protected` respectively work in TypeScript.



```id
js// @ts-checkclass Foo {  constructor() {    /** @private */    this.stuff = 100;  }  printStuff() {    console.log(this.stuff);  }}new Foo().stuff;//        ~~~~~// error! Property 'stuff' is private and only accessible within class 'Foo'.
```



- `@public` is always implied and can be left off, but means that a property can be reached from anywhere.

- `@private` means that a property can only be used within the containing class.

- `@protected` means that a property can only be used within the containing class, and all derived subclasses, but not on dissimilar instances of the containing class.

Next, we’ve also added the `@readonly` modifier to ensure that a property is only ever written to during initialization.



```id
js// @ts-checkclass Foo {  constructor() {    /** @readonly */    this.stuff = 100;  }  writeToStuff() {    this.stuff = 200;    //   ~~~~~    // Cannot assign to 'stuff' because it is a read-only property.  }}new Foo().stuff++;//        ~~~~~// Cannot assign to 'stuff' because it is a read-only property.
```



## Better Directory Watching on Linux and `watchOptions`

TypeScript 3.8 ships a new strategy for watching directories, which is crucial for efficiently picking up changes to `node_modules`.

For some context, on operating systems like Linux, TypeScript installs directory watchers (as opposed to file watchers) on `node_modules` and many of its subdirectories to detect changes in dependencies.
This is because the number of available file watchers is often eclipsed by the number of files in `node_modules`, whereas there are way fewer directories to track.

Older versions of TypeScript would immediately install directory watchers on folders, and at startup that would be fine; however, during an npm install, a lot of activity will take place within `node_modules` and that can overwhelm TypeScript, often slowing editor sessions to a crawl.
To prevent this, TypeScript 3.8 waits slightly before installing directory watchers to give these highly volatile directories some time to stabilize.

Because every project might work better under different strategies, and this new approach might not work well for your workflows, TypeScript 3.8 introduces a new `watchOptions` field in `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` which allows users to tell the compiler/language service which watching strategies should be used to keep track of files and directories.



```
{  // Some typical compiler options  "compilerOptions": {    "target": "es2020",    "moduleResolution": "node"    // ...  },  // NEW: Options for file/directory watching  "watchOptions": {    // Use native file system events for files and directories    "watchFile": "useFsEvents",    "watchDirectory": "useFsEvents",    // Poll files for updates more frequently    // when they're updated a lot.    "fallbackPolling": "dynamicPriority"  }}
```



`watchOptions` contains 4 new options that can be configured:

- 

 `watchFile` : the strategy for how individual files are watched. This can be set to

 `fixedPollingInterval`: Check every file for changes several times a second at a fixed interval.

- `priorityPollingInterval`: Check every file for changes several times a second, but use heuristics to check certain types of files less frequently than others.

- `dynamicPriorityPolling`: Use a dynamic queue where less-frequently modified files will be checked less often.

- `useFsEvents` (the default): Attempt to use the operating system/file system’s native events for file changes.

- `useFsEventsOnParentDirectory`: Attempt to use the operating system/file system’s native events to listen for changes on a file’s containing directories. This can use fewer file watchers, but might be less accurate.

 
- 

 `watchDirectory` : the strategy for how entire directory trees are watched under systems that lack recursive file-watching functionality. This can be set to:

 `fixedPollingInterval`: Check every directory for changes several times a second at a fixed interval.

- `dynamicPriorityPolling`: Use a dynamic queue where less-frequently modified directories will be checked less often.

- `useFsEvents` (the default): Attempt to use the operating system/file system’s native events for directory changes.

 
- 

 `fallbackPolling` : when using file system events, this option specifies the polling strategy that gets used when the system runs out of native file watchers and/or doesn’t support native file watchers. This can be set to

 `fixedPollingInterval`: (See above.) 

- `priorityPollingInterval`: (See above.) 

- `dynamicPriorityPolling`: (See above.) 

- `synchronousWatchDirectory`: Disable deferred watching on directories. Deferred watching is useful when lots of file changes might occur at once (e.g. a change in `node_modules` from running `npm install`), but you might want to disable it with this flag for some less-common setups.

 

For more information on these changes, head over to GitHub to see the pull request to read more.

## “Fast and Loose” Incremental Checking

TypeScript 3.8 introduces a new compiler option called `assumeChangesOnlyAffectDirectDependencies` .
When this option is enabled, TypeScript will avoid rechecking/rebuilding all truly possibly-affected files, and only recheck/rebuild files that have changed as well as files that directly import them.

For example, consider a file `fileD.ts` that imports `fileC.ts` that imports `fileB.ts` that imports `fileA.ts` as follows:



```
fileA.ts <- fileB.ts <- fileC.ts <- fileD.ts
```



In `--watch` mode, a change in `fileA.ts` would typically mean that TypeScript would need to at least re-check `fileB.ts`, `fileC.ts`, and `fileD.ts`.
Under `assumeChangesOnlyAffectDirectDependencies` , a change in `fileA.ts` means that only `fileA.ts` and `fileB.ts` need to be re-checked.

In a codebase like Visual Studio Code, this reduced rebuild times for changes in certain files from about 14 seconds to about 1 second.
While we don’t necessarily recommend this option for all codebases, you might be interested if you have an extremely large codebase and are willing to defer full project errors until later (e.g. a dedicated build via a `tsconfig.fullbuild.json` or in CI).

# TypeScript 4.5

 

## Supporting `lib` from `node_modules`

To ensure that TypeScript and JavaScript support works well out of the box, TypeScript bundles a series of declaration files (`.d.ts` files).
These declaration files represent the available APIs in the JavaScript language, and the standard browser DOM APIs.
While there are some reasonable defaults based on your `target` , you can pick and choose which declaration files your program uses by configuring the `lib` setting in the `tsconfig.json`.

There are two occasional downsides to including these declaration files with TypeScript though:

 When you upgrade TypeScript, you’re also forced to handle changes to TypeScript’s built-in declaration files, and this can be a challenge when the DOM APIs change as frequently as they do.

- It is hard to customize these files to match your needs with the needs of your project’s dependencies (e.g. if your dependencies declare that they use the DOM APIs, you might also be forced into using the DOM APIs).

TypeScript 4.5 introduces a way to override a specific built-in `lib` in a manner similar to how `@types/` support works.
When deciding which `lib` files TypeScript should include, it will first look for a scoped `@typescript/lib-*` package in `node_modules`.
For example, when including `dom` as an option in `lib`, TypeScript will use the types in `node_modules/@typescript/lib-dom` if available.

You can then use your package manager to install a specific package to take over for a given `lib`
For example, today TypeScript publishes versions of the DOM APIs on `@types/web`.
If you wanted to lock your project to a specific version of the DOM APIs, you could add this to your `package.json`:



```id
json{  "dependencies": {    "@typescript/lib-dom": "npm:@types/web"  }}
```



Then from 4.5 onwards, you can update TypeScript and your dependency manager’s lockfile will ensure that it uses the exact same version of the DOM types.
That means you get to update your types on your own terms.

We’d like to give a shout-out to saschanaz who has been extremely helpful and patient as we’ve been building out and experimenting with this feature.

For more information, you can see the implementation of this change .

## The `Awaited` Type and `Promise` Improvements

TypeScript 4.5 introduces a new utility type called the `Awaited` type.
This type is meant to model operations like `await` in `async` functions, or the `.then()` method on `Promise`s - specifically, the way that they recursively unwrap `Promise`s.



```id
ts// A = stringtype A = Awaited<Promise<string>>;// B = numbertype B = Awaited<Promise<Promise<number>>>;// C = boolean | numbertype C = Awaited<boolean | Promise<number>>;
```



The `Awaited` type can be helpful for modeling existing APIs, including JavaScript built-ins like `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, etc.
In fact, some of the problems around inference with `Promise.all` served as motivations for `Awaited`.
Here’s an example that fails in TypeScript 4.4 and earlier.



```id
tsdeclare function MaybePromise<T>(value: T): T | Promise<T> | PromiseLike<T>;async function doSomething(): Promise<[number, number]> {  const result = await Promise.all([MaybePromise(100), MaybePromise(200)]);  // Error!  //  //    [number | Promise<100>, number | Promise<200>]  //  // is not assignable to type  //  //    [number, number]  return result;}
```



Now `Promise.all` leverages the combination of certain features with `Awaited` to give much better inference results, and the above example works.

For more information, you can read about this change on GitHub .

## Template String Types as Discriminants

TypeScript 4.5 now can narrow values that have template string types, and also recognizes template string types as discriminants.

As an example, the following used to fail, but now successfully type-checks in TypeScript 4.5.



```id
tsexport interface Success {    type: `${string}Success`;    body: string;} export interface Error {    type: `${string}Error`;    message: string} export function handler(r: Success | Error) {    if (r.type === "HttpSuccess") {        const token = r.body;                     (parameter) r: Success    }}Try
```



For more information, see the change that enables this feature .

## `module es2022`

Thanks to Kagami S. Rosylight , TypeScript now supports a new `module` setting: `es2022`.
The main feature in `module es2022` is top-level `await`, meaning you can use `await` outside of `async` functions.
This was already supported in `--module esnext` (and now `--module nodenext` ), but `es2022` is the first stable target for this feature.

You can read up more on this change here .

## Tail-Recursion Elimination on Conditional Types

TypeScript often needs to gracefully fail when it detects possibly infinite recursion, or any type expansions that can take a long time and affect your editor experience.
As a result, TypeScript has heuristics to make sure it doesn’t go off the rails when trying to pick apart an infinitely-deep type, or working with types that generate a lot of intermediate results.



```id
tstype InfiniteBox<T> = { item: InfiniteBox<T> };type Unpack<T> = T extends { item: infer U } ? Unpack<U> : T;// error: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.type Test = Unpack<InfiniteBox<number>>;
```



The above example is intentionally simple and useless, but there are plenty of types that are actually useful, and unfortunately trigger our heuristics.
As an example, the following `TrimLeft` type removes spaces from the beginning of a string-like type.
If given a string type that has a space at the beginning, it immediately feeds the remainder of the string back into `TrimLeft`.



```id
tstype TrimLeft<T extends string> =    T extends ` ${infer Rest}` ? TrimLeft<Rest> : T;// Test = "hello" | "world"type Test = TrimLeft<"   hello" | " world">;
```



This type can be useful, but if a string has 50 leading spaces, you’ll get an error.



```id
tstype TrimLeft<T extends string> =    T extends ` ${infer Rest}` ? TrimLeft<Rest> : T;// error: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.type Test = TrimLeft<"                                                oops">;
```



That’s unfortunate, because these kinds of types tend to be extremely useful in modeling operations on strings - for example, parsers for URL routers.
To make matters worse, a more useful type typically creates more type instantiations, and in turn has even more limitations on input length.

But there’s a saving grace: `TrimLeft` is written in a way that is tail-recursive in one branch.
When it calls itself again, it immediately returns the result and doesn’t do anything with it.
Because these types don’t need to create any intermediate results, they can be implemented more quickly and in a way that avoids triggering many of type recursion heuristics that are built into TypeScript.

That’s why TypeScript 4.5 performs some tail-recursion elimination on conditional types.
As long as one branch of a conditional type is simply another conditional type, TypeScript can avoid intermediate instantiations.
There are still heuristics to ensure that these types don’t go off the rails, but they are much more generous.

Keep in mind, the following type won’t be optimized, since it uses the result of a conditional type by adding it to a union.



```id
tstype GetChars<S> =    S extends `${infer Char}${infer Rest}` ? Char | GetChars<Rest> : never;
```



If you would like to make it tail-recursive, you can introduce a helper that takes an “accumulator” type parameter, just like with tail-recursive functions.



```id
tstype GetChars<S> = GetCharsHelper<S, never>;type GetCharsHelper<S, Acc> =    S extends `${infer Char}${infer Rest}` ? GetCharsHelper<Rest, Char | Acc> : Acc;
```



You can read up more on the implementation here .

## Disabling Import Elision

There are some cases where TypeScript can’t detect that you’re using an import.
For example, take the following code:



```id
tsimport { Animal } from "./animal.js";eval("console.log(new Animal().isDangerous())");
```



By default, TypeScript always removes this import because it appears to be unused.
In TypeScript 4.5, you can enable a new flag called `preserveValueImports` to prevent TypeScript from stripping out any imported values from your JavaScript outputs.
Good reasons to use `eval` are few and far between, but something very similar to this happens in Svelte:



```id
html<!-- A .svelte File --><script>  import { someFunc } from "./some-module.js";</script><button on:click="{someFunc}">Click me!</button>
```


 along with in Vue.js, using its `

# TypeScript 3.7

 

## Optional Chaining

 Playground 

Optional chaining is issue #16 on our issue tracker. For context, there have been over 23,000 issues on the TypeScript issue tracker since then.

At its core, optional chaining lets us write code where TypeScript can immediately stop running some expressions if we run into a `null` or `undefined`.
The star of the show in optional chaining is the new `?.` operator for optional property accesses .
When we write code like



```id
tslet x = foo?.bar.baz();
```



this is a way of saying that when `foo` is defined, `foo.bar.baz()` will be computed; but when `foo` is `null` or `undefined`, stop what we’re doing and just return `undefined`.”

More plainly, that code snippet is the same as writing the following.



```id
tslet x = foo === null || foo === undefined ? undefined : foo.bar.baz();
```



Note that if `bar` is `null` or `undefined`, our code will still hit an error accessing `baz`.
Likewise, if `baz` is `null` or `undefined`, we’ll hit an error at the call site.
`?.` only checks for whether the value on the left of it is `null` or `undefined` - not any of the subsequent properties.

You might find yourself using `?.` to replace a lot of code that performs repetitive nullish checks using the `&&` operator.



```id
ts// Beforeif (foo && foo.bar && foo.bar.baz) {  // ...}// After-ishif (foo?.bar?.baz) {  // ...}
```



Keep in mind that `?.` acts differently than those `&&` operations since `&&` will act specially on “falsy” values (e.g. the empty string, `0`, `NaN`, and, well, `false`), but this is an intentional feature of the construct.
It doesn’t short-circuit on valid data like `0` or empty strings.

Optional chaining also includes two other operations.
First there’s the optional element access which acts similarly to optional property accesses, but allows us to access non-identifier properties (e.g. arbitrary strings, numbers, and symbols):



```id
ts/** * Get the first element of the array if we have an array. * Otherwise return undefined. */function tryGetFirstElement<T>(arr?: T[]) {  return arr?.[0];  // equivalent to  //   return (arr === null || arr === undefined) ?  //       undefined :  //       arr[0];}
```



There’s also optional call , which allows us to conditionally call expressions if they’re not `null` or `undefined`.



```id
tsasync function makeRequest(url: string, log?: (msg: string) => void) {  log?.(`Request started at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);  // roughly equivalent to  //   if (log != null) {  //       log(`Request started at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);  //   }  const result = (await fetch(url)).json();  log?.(`Request finished at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);  return result;}
```



The “short-circuiting” behavior that optional chains have is limited property accesses, calls, element accesses - it doesn’t expand any further out from these expressions.
In other words,



```id
tslet result = foo?.bar / someComputation();
```



doesn’t stop the division or `someComputation()` call from occurring.
It’s equivalent to



```id
tslet temp = foo === null || foo === undefined ? undefined : foo.bar;let result = temp / someComputation();
```



That might result in dividing `undefined`, which is why in `strictNullChecks` , the following is an error.



```id
tsfunction barPercentage(foo?: { bar: number }) {  return foo?.bar / 100;  //     ~~~~~~~~  // Error: Object is possibly undefined.}
```



More more details, you can read up on the proposal and view the original pull request .

## Nullish Coalescing

 Playground 

The nullish coalescing operator is another upcoming ECMAScript feature that goes hand-in-hand with optional chaining, and which our team has been involved with championing in TC39.

You can think of this feature - the `??` operator - as a way to “fall back” to a default value when dealing with `null` or `undefined`.
When we write code like



```id
tslet x = foo ?? bar();
```



this is a new way to say that the value `foo` will be used when it’s “present”;
but when it’s `null` or `undefined`, calculate `bar()` in its place.

Again, the above code is equivalent to the following.



```id
tslet x = foo !== null && foo !== undefined ? foo : bar();
```



The `??` operator can replace uses of `||` when trying to use a default value.
For example, the following code snippet tries to fetch the volume that was last saved in `localStorage` (if it ever was);
however, it has a bug because it uses `||`.



```id
tsfunction initializeAudio() {  let volume = localStorage.volume || 0.5;  // ...}
```



When `localStorage.volume` is set to `0`, the page will set the volume to `0.5` which is unintended.
`??` avoids some unintended behavior from `0`, `NaN` and `""` being treated as falsy values.

We owe a large thanks to community members Wenlu Wang and Titian Cernicova Dragomir for implementing this feature!
For more details, check out their pull request and the nullish coalescing proposal repository .

## Assertion Functions

 Playground 

There’s a specific set of functions that `throw` an error if something unexpected happened.
They’re called “assertion” functions.
As an example, Node.js has a dedicated function for this called `assert`.



```id
jsassert(someValue === 42);
```



In this example if `someValue` isn’t equal to `42`, then `assert` will throw an `AssertionError`.

Assertions in JavaScript are often used to guard against improper types being passed in.
For example,



```id
jsfunction multiply(x, y) {  assert(typeof x === "number");  assert(typeof y === "number");  return x * y;}
```



Unfortunately in TypeScript these checks could never be properly encoded.
For loosely-typed code this meant TypeScript was checking less, and for slightly conservative code it often forced users to use type assertions.



```id
tsfunction yell(str) {  assert(typeof str === "string");  return str.toUppercase();  // Oops! We misspelled 'toUpperCase'.  // Would be great if TypeScript still caught this!}
```



The alternative was to instead rewrite the code so that the language could analyze it, but this isn’t convenient.



```id
tsfunction yell(str) {  if (typeof str !== "string") {    throw new TypeError("str should have been a string.");  }  // Error caught!  return str.toUppercase();}
```



Ultimately the goal of TypeScript is to type existing JavaScript constructs in the least disruptive way.
For that reason, TypeScript 3.7 introduces a new concept called “assertion signatures” which model these assertion functions.

The first type of assertion signature models the way that Node’s `assert` function works.
It ensures that whatever condition is being checked must be true for the remainder of the containing scope.



```id
tsfunction assert(condition: any, msg?: string): asserts condition {  if (!condition) {    throw new AssertionError(msg);  }}
```



`asserts condition` says that whatever gets passed into the `condition` parameter must be true if the `assert` returns (because otherwise it would throw an error).
That means that for the rest of the scope, that condition must be truthy.
As an example, using this assertion function means we do catch our original `yell` example.



```id
tsfunction yell(str) {  assert(typeof str === "string");  return str.toUppercase();  //         ~~~~~~~~~~~  // error: Property 'toUppercase' does not exist on type 'string'.  //        Did you mean 'toUpperCase'?}function assert(condition: any, msg?: string): asserts condition {  if (!condition) {    throw new AssertionError(msg);  }}
```



The other type of assertion signature doesn’t check for a condition, but instead tells TypeScript that a specific variable or property has a different type.



```id
tsfunction assertIsString(val: any): asserts val is string {  if (typeof val !== "string") {    throw new AssertionError("Not a string!");  }}
```



Here `asserts val is string` ensures that after any call to `assertIsString`, any variable passed in will be known to be a `string`.



```id
tsfunction yell(str: any) {  assertIsString(str);  // Now TypeScript knows that 'str' is a 'string'.  return str.toUppercase();  //         ~~~~~~~~~~~  // error: Property 'toUppercase' does not exist on type 'string'.  //        Did you mean 'toUpperCase'?}
```



These assertion signatures are very similar to writing type predicate signatures:



```id
tsfunction isString(val: any): val is string {  return typeof val === "string";}function yell(str: any) {  if (isString(str)) {    return str.toUppercase();  }  throw "Oops!";}
```



And just like type predicate signatures, these assertion signatures are incredibly expressive.
We can express some fairly sophisticated ideas with these.



```id
tsfunction assertIsDefined<T>(val: T): asserts val is NonNullable<T> {  if (val === undefined || val === null) {    throw new AssertionError(      `Expected 'val' to be defined, but received ${val}`    );  }}
```



To read up more about assertion signatures, check out the original pull request .

## Better Support for `never`-Returning Functions

As part of the work for assertion signatures, TypeScript needed to encode more about where and which functions were being called.
This gave us the opportunity to expand support for another class of functions: functions that return `never`.

The intent of any function that returns `never` is that it never returns.
It indicates that an exception was thrown, a halting error condition occurred, or that the program exited.
For example, `process.exit(...)` in `@types/node` is specified to return `never`.

In order to ensure that a function never potentially returned `undefined` or effectively returned from all code paths, TypeScript needed some syntactic signal - either a `return` or `throw` at the end of a function.
So users found themselves `return`-ing their failure functions.



```id
tsfunction dispatch(x: string | number): SomeType {  if (typeof x === "string") {    return doThingWithString(x);  } else if (typeof x === "number") {    return doThingWithNumber(x);  }  return process.exit(1);}
```



Now when these `never`-returning functions are called, TypeScript recognizes that they affect the control flow graph and accounts for them.



```id
tsfunction dispatch(x: string | number): SomeType {  if (typeof x === "string") {    return doThingWithString(x);  } else if (typeof x === "number") {    return doThingWithNumber(x);  }  process.exit(1);}
```



As with assertion functions, you can read up more at the same pull request .

## (More) Recursive Type Aliases

 Playground 

Type aliases have always had a limitation in how they could be “recursively” referenced.
The reason is that any use of a type alias needs to be able to substitute itself with whatever it aliases.
In some cases, that’s not possible, so the compiler rejects certain recursive aliases like the following:



```id
tstype Foo = Foo;
```



This is a reasonable restriction because any use of `Foo` would need to be replaced with `Foo` which would need to be replaced with `Foo` which would need to be replaced with `Foo` which… well, hopefully you get the idea!
In the end, there isn’t a type that makes sense in place of `Foo`.

This is fairly consistent with how other languages treat type aliases , but it does give rise to some slightly surprising scenarios for how users leverage the feature.
For example, in TypeScript 3.6 and prior, the following causes an error.



```id
tstype ValueOrArray<T> = T | Array<ValueOrArray<T>>;//   ~~~~~~~~~~~~// error: Type alias 'ValueOrArray' circularly references itself.
```



This is strange because there is technically nothing wrong with any use users could always write what was effectively the same code by introducing an interface.



```id
tstype ValueOrArray<T> = T | ArrayOfValueOrArray<T>;interface ArrayOfValueOrArray<T> extends Array<ValueOrArray<T>> {}
```



Because interfaces (and other object types) introduce a level of indirection and their full structure doesn’t need to be eagerly built out, TypeScript has no problem working with this structure.

But workaround of introducing the interface wasn’t intuitive for users.
And in principle there really wasn’t anything wrong with the original version of `ValueOrArray` that used `Array` directly.
If the compiler was a little bit “lazier” and only calculated the type arguments to `Array` when necessary, then TypeScript could express these correctly.

That’s exactly what TypeScript 3.7 introduces.
At the “top level” of a type alias, TypeScript will defer resolving type arguments to permit these patterns.

This means that code like the following that was trying to represent JSON…



```id
tstype Json = string | number | boolean | null | JsonObject | JsonArray;interface JsonObject {  [property: string]: Json;}interface JsonArray extends Array<Json> {}
```



can finally be rewritten without helper interfaces.



```id
tstype Json =  | string  | number  | boolean  | null  | { [property: string]: Json }  | Json[];
```



This new relaxation also lets us recursively reference type aliases in tuples as well.
The following code which used to error is now valid TypeScript code.



```id
tstype VirtualNode = string | [string, { [key: string]: any }, ...VirtualNode[]];const myNode: VirtualNode = [  "div",  { id: "parent" },  ["div", { id: "first-child" }, "I'm the first child"],  ["div", { id: "second-child" }, "I'm the second child"],];
```

## `--declaration` and `--allowJs`

The `declaration` flag in TypeScript allows us to generate `.d.ts` files (declaration files) from TypeScript source files (i.e. `.ts` and `.tsx` files).
These `.d.ts` files are important for a couple of reasons.

First of all, they’re important because they allow TypeScript to type-check against other projects without re-checking the original source code.
They’re also important because they allow TypeScript to interoperate with existing JavaScript libraries that weren’t built with TypeScript in mind.
Finally, a benefit that is often underappreciated: both TypeScript and JavaScript users can benefit from these files when using editors powered by TypeScript to get things like better auto-completion.

Unfortunately, `declaration` didn’t work with the `allowJs` flag which allows mixing TypeScript and JavaScript input files.
This was a frustrating limitation because it meant users couldn’t use the `declaration` flag when migrating codebases, even if they were JSDoc-annotated.
TypeScript 3.7 changes that, and allows the two options to be used together!

The most impactful outcome of this feature might a bit subtle: with TypeScript 3.7, users can write libraries in JSDoc annotated JavaScript and support TypeScript users.

The way that this works is that when using `allowJs` , TypeScript has some best-effort analyses to understand common JavaScript patterns; however, the way that some patterns are expressed in JavaScript don’t necessarily look like their equivalents in TypeScript.
When `declaration` emit is turned on, TypeScript figures out the best way to transform JSDoc comments and CommonJS exports into valid type declarations and the like in the output `.d.ts` files.

As an example, the following code snippet



```id
jsconst assert = require("assert");module.exports.blurImage = blurImage;/** * Produces a blurred image from an input buffer. * * @param input {Uint8Array} * @param width {number} * @param height {number} */function blurImage(input, width, height) {  const numPixels = width * height * 4;  assert(input.length === numPixels);  const result = new Uint8Array(numPixels);  // TODO  return result;}
```



Will produce a `.d.ts` file like



```id
ts/** * Produces a blurred image from an input buffer. * * @param input {Uint8Array} * @param width {number} * @param height {number} */export function blurImage(  input: Uint8Array,  width: number,  height: number): Uint8Array;
```



This can go beyond basic functions with `@param` tags too, where the following example:



```id
js/** * @callback Job * @returns {void} *//** Queues work */export class Worker {  constructor(maxDepth = 10) {    this.started = false;    this.depthLimit = maxDepth;    /**     * NOTE: queued jobs may add more items to queue     * @type {Job[]}     */    this.queue = [];  }  /**   * Adds a work item to the queue   * @param {Job} work   */  push(work) {    if (this.queue.length + 1 > this.depthLimit) throw new Error("Queue full!");    this.queue.push(work);  }  /**   * Starts the queue if it has not yet started   */  start() {    if (this.started) return false;    this.started = true;    while (this.queue.length) {      /** @type {Job} */ (this.queue.shift())();    }    return true;  }}
```



will be transformed into the following `.d.ts` file:



```id
ts/** * @callback Job * @returns {void} *//** Queues work */export class Worker {  constructor(maxDepth?: number);  started: boolean;  depthLimit: number;  /**   * NOTE: queued jobs may add more items to queue   * @type {Job[]}   */  queue: Job[];  /**   * Adds a work item to the queue   * @param {Job} work   */  push(work: Job): void;  /**   * Starts the queue if it has not yet started   */  start(): boolean;}export type Job = () => void;
```



Note that when using these flags together, TypeScript doesn’t necessarily have to downlevel `.js` files.
If you simply want TypeScript to create `.d.ts` files, you can use the `emitDeclarationOnly` compiler option.

## The `useDefineForClassFields` Flag and The `declare` Property Modifier

Back when TypeScript implemented public class fields, we assumed to the best of our abilities that the following code



```id
tsclass C {  foo = 100;  bar: string;}
```



would be equivalent to a similar assignment within a constructor body.



```id
tsclass C {  constructor() {    this.foo = 100;  }}
```



Unfortunately, while this seemed to be the direction that the proposal moved towards in its earlier days, there is an extremely strong chance that public class fields will be standardized differently.
Instead, the original code sample might need to de-sugar to something closer to the following:



```id
tsclass C {  constructor() {    Object.defineProperty(this, "foo", {      enumerable: true,      configurable: true,      writable: true,      value: 100,    });    Object.defineProperty(this, "bar", {      enumerable: true,      configurable: true,      writable: true,      value: void 0,    });  }}
```



While TypeScript 3.7 isn’t changing any existing emit by default, we’ve been rolling out changes incrementally to help users mitigate potential future breakage.
We’ve provided a new flag called `useDefineForClassFields` to enable this emit mode with some new checking logic.

The two biggest changes are the following:

 Declarations are initialized with `Object.defineProperty`.

- Declarations are always initialized to `undefined`, even if they have no initializer.

This can cause quite a bit of fallout for existing code that use inheritance. First of all, `set` accessors from base classes won’t get triggered - they’ll be completely overwritten.



```id
tsclass Base {  set data(value: string) {    console.log("data changed to " + value);  }}class Derived extends Base {  // No longer triggers a 'console.log'  // when using 'useDefineForClassFields'.  data = 10;}
```



Secondly, using class fields to specialize properties from base classes also won’t work.



```id
tsinterface Animal {  animalStuff: any;}interface Dog extends Animal {  dogStuff: any;}class AnimalHouse {  resident: Animal;  constructor(animal: Animal) {    this.resident = animal;  }}class DogHouse extends AnimalHouse {  // Initializes 'resident' to 'undefined'  // after the call to 'super()' when  // using 'useDefineForClassFields'!  resident: Dog;  constructor(dog: Dog) {    super(dog);  }}
```



What these two boil down to is that mixing properties with accessors is going to cause issues, and so will re-declaring properties with no initializers.

To detect the issue around accessors, TypeScript 3.7 will now emit `get`/`set` accessors in `.d.ts` files so that in TypeScript can check for overridden accessors.

Code that’s impacted by the class fields change can get around the issue by converting field initializers to assignments in constructor bodies.



```id
tsclass Base {  set data(value: string) {    console.log("data changed to " + value);  }}class Derived extends Base {  constructor() {    this.data = 10;  }}
```



To help mitigate the second issue, you can either add an explicit initializer or add a `declare` modifier to indicate that a property should have no emit.



```id
tsinterface Animal {  animalStuff: any;}interface Dog extends Animal {  dogStuff: any;}class AnimalHouse {  resident: Animal;  constructor(animal: Animal) {    this.resident = animal;  }}class DogHouse extends AnimalHouse {  declare resident: Dog;  //  ^^^^^^^  // 'resident' now has a 'declare' modifier,  // and won't produce any output code.  constructor(dog: Dog) {    super(dog);  }}
```



Currently `useDefineForClassFields` is only available when targeting ES5 and upwards, since `Object.defineProperty` doesn’t exist in ES3.
To achieve similar checking for issues, you can create a separate project that targets ES5 and uses `noEmit` to avoid a full build.

For more information, you can take a look at the original pull request for these changes .

We strongly encourage users to try the `useDefineForClassFields` flag and report back on our issue tracker or in the comments below.
This includes feedback on difficulty of adopting the flag so we can understand how we can make migration easier.

## Build-Free Editing with Project References

TypeScript’s project references provide us with an easy way to break codebases up to give us faster compiles.
Unfortunately, editing a project whose dependencies hadn’t been built (or whose output was out of date) meant that the editing experience wouldn’t work well.

In TypeScript 3.7, when opening a project with dependencies, TypeScript will automatically use the source `.ts`/`.tsx` files instead.
This means projects using project references will now see an improved editing experience where semantic operations are up-to-date and “just work”.
You can disable this behavior with the compiler option `disableSourceOfProjectReferenceRedirect` which may be appropriate when working in very large projects where this change may impact editing performance.

You can read up more about this change by reading up on its pull request .

## Uncalled Function Checks

A common and dangerous error is to forget to invoke a function, especially if the function has zero arguments or is named in a way that implies it might be a property rather than a function.



```id
tsinterface User {  isAdministrator(): boolean;  notify(): void;  doNotDisturb?(): boolean;}// later...// Broken code, do not use!function doAdminThing(user: User) {  // oops!  if (user.isAdministrator) {    sudo();    editTheConfiguration();  } else {    throw new AccessDeniedError("User is not an admin");  }}
```



Here, we forgot to call `isAdministrator`, and the code incorrectly allows non-administrator users to edit the configuration!

In TypeScript 3.7, this is identified as a likely error:



```id
tsfunction doAdminThing(user: User) {    if (user.isAdministrator) {    //  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    // error! This condition will always return true since the function is always defined.    //        Did you mean to call it instead?
```



This check is a breaking change, but for that reason the checks are very conservative.
This error is only issued in `if` conditions, and it is not issued on optional properties, if `strictNullChecks` is off, or if the function is later called within the body of the `if`:



```id
tsinterface User {  isAdministrator(): boolean;  notify(): void;  doNotDisturb?(): boolean;}function issueNotification(user: User) {  if (user.doNotDisturb) {    // OK, property is optional  }  if (user.notify) {    // OK, called the function    user.notify();  }}
```



If you intended to test the function without calling it, you can correct the definition of it to include `undefined`/`null`, or use `!!` to write something like `if (!!user.isAdministrator)` to indicate that the coercion is intentional.

We owe a big thanks to GitHub user @jwbay who took the initiative to create a proof-of-concept and iterated to provide us with the current version .

## `// @ts-nocheck` in TypeScript Files

TypeScript 3.7 allows us to add `// @ts-nocheck` comments to the top of TypeScript files to disable semantic checks.
Historically this comment was only respected in JavaScript source files in the presence of `checkJs` , but we’ve expanded support to TypeScript files to make migrations easier for all users.

## Semicolon Formatter Option

TypeScript’s built-in formatter now supports semicolon insertion and removal at locations where a trailing semicolon is optional due to JavaScript’s automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) rules. The setting is available now in Visual Studio Code Insiders , and will be available in Visual Studio 16.4 Preview 2 in the Tools Options menu.

 

Choosing a value of “insert” or “remove” also affects the format of auto-imports, extracted types, and other generated code provided by TypeScript services. Leaving the setting on its default value of “ignore” makes generated code match the semicolon preference detected in the current file.

## 3.7 Breaking Changes

### DOM Changes

 Types in `lib.dom.d.ts` have been updated .
These changes are largely correctness changes related to nullability, but impact will ultimately depend on your codebase.

### Class Field Mitigations

 As mentioned above , TypeScript 3.7 emits `get`/`set` accessors in `.d.ts` files which can cause breaking changes for consumers on older versions of TypeScript like 3.5 and prior.
TypeScript 3.6 users will not be impacted, since that version was future-proofed for this feature.

While not a breakage per se, opting in to the `useDefineForClassFields` flag can cause breakage when:

- overriding an accessor in a derived class with a property declaration

- re-declaring a property declaration with no initializer

To understand the full impact, read the section above on the `useDefineForClassFields` flag .

### Function Truthy Checks

As mentioned above, TypeScript now errors when functions appear to be uncalled within `if` statement conditions.
An error is issued when a function type is checked in `if` conditions unless any of the following apply:

- the checked value comes from an optional property

- `strictNullChecks` is disabled

- the function is later called within the body of the `if`

### Local and Imported Type Declarations Now Conflict

Due to a bug, the following construct was previously allowed in TypeScript:



```id
ts// ./someOtherModule.tsinterface SomeType {  y: string;}// ./myModule.tsimport { SomeType } from "./someOtherModule";export interface SomeType {  x: number;}function fn(arg: SomeType) {  console.log(arg.x); // Error! 'x' doesn't exist on 'SomeType'}
```



Here, `SomeType` appears to originate in both the `import` declaration and the local `interface` declaration.
Perhaps surprisingly, inside the module, `SomeType` refers exclusively to the `import`ed definition, and the local declaration `SomeType` is only usable when imported from another file.
This is very confusing and our review of the very small number of cases of code like this in the wild showed that developers usually thought something different was happening.

In TypeScript 3.7, this is now correctly identified as a duplicate identifier error .
The correct fix depends on the original intent of the author and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
Usually, the naming conflict is unintentional and the best fix is to rename the imported type.
If the intent was to augment the imported type, a proper module augmentation should be written instead.

### 3.7 API Changes

To enable the recursive type alias patterns described above, the `typeArguments` property has been removed from the `TypeReference` interface. Users should instead use the `getTypeArguments` function on `TypeChecker` instances.

# TypeScript 4.4

 

## Control Flow Analysis of Aliased Conditions and Discriminants

In JavaScript, we often have to probe a value in different ways, and do something different once we know more about its type.
TypeScript understands these checks and calls them type guards .
Instead of having to convince TypeScript of a variable’s type whenever we use it, the type-checker leverages something called control flow analysis to see if we’ve used a type guard before a given piece of code.

For example, we can write something like



```id
tsfunction foo(arg: unknown) {  if (typeof arg === "string") {    console.log(arg.toUpperCase());                (parameter) arg: string  }}Try
```



In this example, we checked whether `arg` was a `string`.
TypeScript recognized the `typeof arg === "string"` check, which it considered a type guard, and knew that `arg` was a `string` inside the body of the `if` block.
That let us access `string` methods like `toUpperCase()` without getting an error.

However, what would happen if we moved the condition out to a constant called `argIsString`?



```id
ts// In TS 4.3 and belowfunction foo(arg: unknown) {  const argIsString = typeof arg === "string";  if (argIsString) {    console.log(arg.toUpperCase());    //              ~~~~~~~~~~~    // Error! Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'unknown'.  }}
```



In previous versions of TypeScript, this would be an error - even though `argIsString` was assigned the value of a type guard, TypeScript simply lost that information.
That’s unfortunate since we might want to re-use the same check in several places.
To get around that, users often have to repeat themselves or use type assertions (a.k.a. casts).

In TypeScript 4.4, that is no longer the case.
The above example works with no errors!
When TypeScript sees that we are testing a constant value, it will do a little bit of extra work to see if it contains a type guard.
If that type guard operates on a `const`, a `readonly` property, or an un-modified parameter, then TypeScript is able to narrow that value appropriately.

Different sorts of type guard conditions are preserved - not just `typeof` checks.
For example, checks on discriminated unions work like a charm.



```id
tstype Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; sideLength: number }; function area(shape: Shape): number {  const isCircle = shape.kind === "circle";  if (isCircle) {    // We know we have a circle here!    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;  } else {    // We know we&apos;re left with a square here!    return shape.sideLength ** 2;  }}Try
```



Analysis on discriminants in 4.4 also goes a little bit deeper - we can now extract out discriminants and TypeScript can narrow the original object.



```id
tstype Shape =  | { kind: "circle"; radius: number }  | { kind: "square"; sideLength: number }; function area(shape: Shape): number {  // Extract out the &apos;kind&apos; field first.  const { kind } = shape;   if (kind === "circle") {    // We know we have a circle here!    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;  } else {    // We know we&apos;re left with a square here!    return shape.sideLength ** 2;  }}Try
```



As another example, here’s a function that checks whether two of its inputs have contents.



```id
tsfunction doSomeChecks(  inputA: string | undefined,  inputB: string | undefined,  shouldDoExtraWork: boolean) {  const mustDoWork = inputA && inputB && shouldDoExtraWork;  if (mustDoWork) {    // We can access &apos;string&apos; properties on both &apos;inputA&apos; and &apos;inputB&apos;!    const upperA = inputA.toUpperCase();    const upperB = inputB.toUpperCase();    // ...  }}Try
```



TypeScript can understand that both `inputA` and `inputB` are both present if `mustDoWork` is `true`.
That means we don’t have to write a non-null assertion like `inputA!` to convince TypeScript that `inputA` isn’t `undefined`.

One neat feature here is that this analysis works transitively.
TypeScript will hop through constants to understand what sorts of checks you’ve already performed.

 


```id
tsfunction f(x: string | number | boolean) {  const isString = typeof x === "string";  const isNumber = typeof x === "number";  const isStringOrNumber = isString || isNumber;  if (isStringOrNumber) {    x;   (parameter) x: string | number  } else {    x;   (parameter) x: boolean  }}Try
```



Note that there’s a cutoff - TypeScript doesn’t go arbitrarily deep when checking these conditions, but its analysis is deep enough for most checks.

This feature should make a lot of intuitive JavaScript code “just work” in TypeScript without it getting in your way.
For more details, check out the implementation on GitHub !

## Symbol and Template String Pattern Index Signatures

TypeScript lets us describe objects where every property has to have a certain type using index signatures .
This allows us to use these objects as dictionary-like types, where we can use string keys to index into them with square brackets.

For example, we can write a type with an index signature that takes `string` keys and maps to `boolean` values.
If we try to assign anything other than a `boolean` value, we’ll get an error.



```id
tsinterface BooleanDictionary {  [key: string]: boolean;} declare let myDict: BooleanDictionary; // Valid to assign boolean valuesmyDict["foo"] = true;myDict["bar"] = false; // Error, "oops" isn&apos;t a booleanmyDict["baz"] = "oops";Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.Try
```



While a `Map` might be a better data structure here (specifically, a `Map `), JavaScript objects are often more convenient to use or just happen to be what we’re given to work with.

Similarly, `Array ` already defines a `number` index signature that lets us insert/retrieve values of type `T`.



```id
ts// @errors: 2322 2375// This is part of TypeScript's definition of the built-in Array type.interface Array<T> {  [index: number]: T;  // ...}let arr = new Array<string>();// Validarr[0] = "hello!";// Error, expecting a 'string' value herearr[1] = 123;
```



Index signatures are very useful to express lots of code out in the wild;
however, until now they’ve been limited to `string` and `number` keys (and `string` index signatures have an intentional quirk where they can accept `number` keys since they’ll be coerced to strings anyway).
That means that TypeScript didn’t allow indexing objects with `symbol` keys.
TypeScript also couldn’t model an index signature of some subset of `string` keys - for example, an index signature which describes just properties whose names start with the text `data-`.

TypeScript 4.4 addresses these limitations, and allows index signatures for `symbol`s and template string patterns.

For example, TypeScript now allows us to declare a type that can be keyed on arbitrary `symbol`s.



```id
tsinterface Colors {  [sym: symbol]: number;} const red =  symbol' >Symbol("red");const green =  symbol' >Symbol("green");const blue =  symbol' >Symbol("blue"); let colors: Colors = {}; // Assignment of a number is allowedcolors[red] = 255;let redVal = colors[red];      let redVal: number colors[blue] = "da ba dee";Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.Try
```



Similarly, we can write an index signature with template string pattern type.
One use of this might be to exempt properties starting with `data-` from TypeScript’s excess property checking.
When we pass an object literal to something with an expected type, TypeScript will look for excess properties that weren’t declared in the expected type.



```id
ts// @errors: 2322 2375interface Options {    width?: number;    height?: number;}let a: Options = {    width: 100,    height: 100,    "data-blah": true,};interface OptionsWithDataProps extends Options {    // Permit any property starting with 'data-'.    [optName: `data-${string}`]: unknown;}let b: OptionsWithDataProps = {    width: 100,    height: 100,    "data-blah": true,    // Fails for a property which is not known, nor    // starts with 'data-'    "unknown-property": true,};
```



A final note on index signatures is that they now permit union types, as long as they’re a union of infinite-domain primitive types - specifically:

 `string`

- `number`

- `symbol`

- template string patterns (e.g. ``hello-${string}``)

An index signature whose argument is a union of these types will de-sugar into several different index signatures.



```id
tsinterface Data {  [optName: string | symbol]: any;}// Equivalent tointerface Data {  [optName: string]: any;  [optName: symbol]: any;}
```

## Defaulting to the `unknown` Type in Catch Variables (`--useUnknownInCatchVariables`)

In JavaScript, any type of value can be thrown with `throw` and caught in a `catch` clause.
Because of this, TypeScript historically typed catch clause variables as `any`, and would not allow any other type annotation:



```id
tstry {  // Who knows what this might throw...  executeSomeThirdPartyCode();} catch (err) {  // err: any  console.error(err.message); // Allowed, because 'any'  err.thisWillProbablyFail(); // Allowed, because 'any' :(}
```



Once TypeScript added the `unknown` type, it became clear that `unknown` was a better choice than `any` in `catch` clause variables for users who want the highest degree of correctness and type-safety, since it narrows better and forces us to test against arbitrary values.
Eventually TypeScript 4.0 allowed users to specify an explicit type annotation of `unknown` (or `any`) on each `catch` clause variable so that we could opt into stricter types on a case-by-case basis;
however, for some, manually specifying `: unknown` on every `catch` clause was a chore.

That’s why TypeScript 4.4 introduces a new flag called `useUnknownInCatchVariables` .
This flag changes the default type of `catch` clause variables from `any` to `unknown`.



```id
tstry {  executeSomeThirdPartyCode();} catch (err) {  // err: unknown   // Error! Property &apos;message&apos; does not exist on type &apos;unknown&apos;.  console.error(err.message);'err' is of type 'unknown'.18046'err' is of type 'unknown'.   // Works! We can narrow &apos;err&apos; from &apos;unknown&apos; to &apos;Error&apos;.  if (err instanceof Error) {    console.error(err.message);  }}Try
```



This flag is enabled under the `strict` family of options.
That means that if you check your code using `strict` , this option will automatically be turned on.
You may end up with errors in TypeScript 4.4 such as



```
Property 'message' does not exist on type 'unknown'.Property 'name' does not exist on type 'unknown'.Property 'stack' does not exist on type 'unknown'.
```



In cases where we don’t want to deal with an `unknown` variable in a `catch` clause, we can always add an explicit `: any` annotation so that we can opt out of stricter types.

 


```id
tstry {  executeSomeThirdPartyCode();} catch (err: any) {  console.error(err.message); // Works again!}Try
```



For more information, take a look at the implementing pull request .

## Exact Optional Property Types (`--exactOptionalPropertyTypes`)

In JavaScript, reading a missing property on an object produces the value `undefined`.
It’s also possible to have an actual property with the value `undefined`.
A lot of code in JavaScript tends to treat these situations the same way, and so initially TypeScript just interpreted every optional property as if a user had written `undefined` in the type.
For example,



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age?: number;}
```



was considered equivalent to



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age?: number | undefined;}
```



What this meant is that a user could explicitly write `undefined` in place of `age`.



```id
tsconst p: Person = {  name: "Daniel",  age: undefined, // This is okay by default.};
```



So by default, TypeScript doesn’t distinguish between a present property with the value `undefined` and a missing property.
While this works most of the time, not all code in JavaScript makes the same assumptions.
Functions and operators like `Object.assign`, `Object.keys`, object spread (`{ ...obj }`), and `for`-`in` loops behave differently depending on whether or not a property actually exists on an object.
In the case of our `Person` example, this could potentially lead to runtime errors if the `age` property was observed in a context where its presence was important.

In TypeScript 4.4, the new flag `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` specifies that optional property types should be interpreted exactly as written, meaning that `| undefined` is not added to the type:



```id
ts// With &apos;exactOptionalPropertyTypes&apos; on:const p: Person = {Type '{ name: string; age: undefined; }' is not assignable to type 'Person' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'. Consider adding 'undefined' to the types of the target's properties.
  Types of property 'age' are incompatible.
    Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.2375Type '{ name: string; age: undefined; }' is not assignable to type 'Person' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'. Consider adding 'undefined' to the types of the target's properties.
  Types of property 'age' are incompatible.
    Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.  name: "Daniel",  age: undefined, // Error! undefined isn&apos;t a number};Try
```



This flag is not part of the `strict` family and needs to be turned on explicitly if you’d like this behavior.
It also requires `strictNullChecks` to be enabled as well.
We’ve been making updates to DefinitelyTyped and other definitions to try to make the transition as straightforward as possible, but you may encounter some friction with this depending on how your code is structured.

For more information, you can take a look at the implementing pull request here .

## `static` Blocks in Classes

TypeScript 4.4 brings support for `static` blocks in classes , an upcoming ECMAScript feature that can help you write more-complex initialization code for static members.



```id
tsclass Foo {    static count = 0;     // This is a static block:    static {        if (someCondition()) {            Foo.count++;        }    }}Try
```



These static blocks allow you to write a sequence of statements with their own scope that can access private fields within the containing class.
That means that we can write initialization code with all the capabilities of writing statements, no leakage of variables, and full access to our class’s internals.



```id
tsclass Foo {    static #count = 0;     get count() {        return Foo.#count;    }     static {        try {            const lastInstances = loadLastInstances();            Foo.#count += lastInstances..length: number' >length;        }        catch {}    }}Try
```



Without `static` blocks, writing the code above was possible, but often involved several different types of hacks that had to compromise in some way.

Note that a class can have multiple `static` blocks, and they’re run in the same order in which they’re written.



```id
ts// Prints://    1//    2//    3class Foo {    static prop = 1    static {        console.log(Foo.prop++);    }    static {        console.log(Foo.prop++);    }    static {        console.log(Foo.prop++);    }}Try
```



We’d like to extend our thanks to Wenlu Wang for TypeScript’s implementation of this feature.

## `tsc --help` Updates and Improvements

TypeScript’s `--help` option has gotten a refresh!
Thanks to work in part by Song Gao , we’ve brought in changes to update the descriptions of our compiler options and restyle the `--help` menu with colors and other visual separation.

 

You can read more on the original proposal thread .

## Performance Improvements

### Faster Declaration Emit

TypeScript now caches whether internal symbols are accessible in different contexts, along with how specific types should be printed.
These changes can improve TypeScript’s general performance in code with fairly complex types, and is especially observed when emitting `.d.ts` files under the `declaration` flag.

 See more details here .

### Faster Path Normalization

TypeScript often has to do several types of “normalization” on file paths to get them into a consistent format that the compiler can use everywhere.
This involves things like replacing backslashes with slashes, or removing intermediate `/./` and `/../` segments of paths.
When TypeScript has to operate over millions of these paths, these operations end up being a bit slow.
In TypeScript 4.4, paths first undergo quick checks to see whether they need any normalization in the first place.
These improvements together reduce project load time by 5-10% on bigger projects, and significantly more in massive projects that we’ve tested internally.

For more details, you can view the PR for path segment normalization along with the PR for slash normalization .

### Faster Path Mapping

TypeScript now caches the way it constructs path-mappings (using the `paths` option in `tsconfig.json`).
For projects with several hundred mappings, the reduction is significant.
You can see more on the change itself .

### Faster Incremental Builds with `--strict`

In what was effectively a bug, TypeScript would end up redoing type-checking work under `incremental` compilations if `strict` was on.
This led to many builds being just as slow as if `incremental` was turned off.
TypeScript 4.4 fixes this, though the change has also been back-ported to TypeScript 4.3.

See more here .

### Faster Source Map Generation for Big Outputs

TypeScript 4.4 adds an optimization for source map generation on extremely large output files.
When building an older version of the TypeScript compiler, this results in around an 8% reduction in emit time.

We’d like to extend our thanks to David Michon who provided a simple and clean change to enable this performance win.

### Faster `--force` Builds

When using `--build` mode on project references, TypeScript has to perform up-to-date checks to determine which files need to be rebuilt.
When performing a `--force` build, however, that information is irrelevant since every project dependency will be rebuilt from scratch.
In TypeScript 4.4, `--force` builds avoid those unnecessary steps and start a full build.
See more about the change here .

## Spelling Suggestions for JavaScript

TypeScript powers the JavaScript editing experience in editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
Most of the time, TypeScript tries to stay out of the way in JavaScript files;
however, TypeScript often has a lot of information to make confident suggestions, and ways of surfacing suggestions that aren’t too invasive.

That’s why TypeScript now issues spelling suggestions in plain JavaScript files - ones without `// @ts-check` or in a project with `checkJs` turned off.
These are the same “Did you mean…?” suggestions that TypeScript files already have, and now they’re available in all JavaScript files in some form.

These spelling suggestions can provide a subtle clue that your code is wrong.
We managed to find a few bugs in existing code while testing this feature!

For more details on this new feature, take a look at the pull request !

## Inlay Hints

TypeScript 4.4 provides support for inlay hints which can help display useful information like parameter names and return types in your code.
You can think of it as a sort of friendly “ghost text”.

 

This feature was built by Wenlu Wang whose pull request has more details.

Wenlu also contributed the integration for inlay hints in Visual Studio Code which has shipped as part of the July 2021 (1.59) release .
If you’d like to try inlay hints out, make sure you’re using a recent stable or insiders version of the editor.
You can also modify when and where inlay hints get displayed in Visual Studio Code’s settings.

## Auto-Imports Show True Paths in Completion Lists

When editors like Visual Studio Code show a completion list, completions which include auto-imports are displayed with a path to the given module;
however, this path usually isn’t what TypeScript ends up placing in a module specifier.
The path is usually something relative to the workspace , meaning that if you’re importing from a package like `moment`, you’ll often see a path like `node_modules/moment`.

 

These paths end up being unwieldy and often misleading, especially given that the path that actually gets inserted into your file needs to consider Node’s `node_modules` resolution, path mappings, symlinks, and re-exports.

That’s why with TypeScript 4.4, the completion item label now shows the actual module path that will be used for the import!

 

Since this calculation can be expensive, completion lists containing many auto-imports may fill in the final module specifiers in batches as you type more characters. It’s possible that you’ll still sometimes see the old workspace-relative path labels; however, as your editing experience “warms up”, they should get replaced with the actual path after another keystroke or two.

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes for TypeScript 4.4

As with every TypeScript version, declarations for `lib.d.ts` (especially the declarations generated for web contexts), have changed.
You can consult our list of known `lib.dom.d.ts` changes to understand what is impacted.

### More-Compliant Indirect Calls for Imported Functions

In earlier versions of TypeScript, calling an import from CommonJS, AMD, and other non-ES module systems would set the `this` value of the called function.
Specifically, in the following example, when calling `fooModule.foo()`, the `foo()` method will have `fooModule` set as the value of `this`.



```id
ts// Imagine this is our imported module, and it has an export named 'foo'.let fooModule = {  foo() {    console.log(this);  },};fooModule.foo();
```



This is not the way exported functions in ECMAScript are supposed to work when we call them.
That’s why TypeScript 4.4 intentionally discards the `this` value when calling imported functions, by using the following emit.



```id
ts// Imagine this is our imported module, and it has an export named 'foo'.let fooModule = {  foo() {    console.log(this);  },};// Notice we're actually calling '(0, fooModule.foo)' now, which is subtly different.(0, fooModule.foo)();
```



You can read up more about the changes here .

### Using `unknown` in Catch Variables

Users running with the `strict` flag may see new errors around `catch` variables being `unknown`, especially if the existing code assumes only `Error` values have been caught.
This often results in error messages such as:



```
Property 'message' does not exist on type 'unknown'.Property 'name' does not exist on type 'unknown'.Property 'stack' does not exist on type 'unknown'.
```



To get around this, you can specifically add runtime checks to ensure that the thrown type matches your expected type.
Otherwise, you can just use a type assertion, add an explicit `: any` to your catch variable, or turn off `useUnknownInCatchVariables` .

### Broader Always-Truthy Promise Checks

In prior versions, TypeScript introduced “Always Truthy Promise checks” to catch code where an `await` may have been forgotten;
however, the checks only applied to named declarations.
That meant that while this code would correctly receive an error…



```id
tsasync function foo(): Promise<boolean> {  return false;}async function bar(): Promise<string> {  const fooResult = foo();  if (fooResult) {    // <- error! :D    return "true";  }  return "false";}
```



…the following code would not.



```id
tsasync function foo(): Promise<boolean> {  return false;}async function bar(): Promise<string> {  if (foo()) {    // <- no error :(    return "true";  }  return "false";}
```



TypeScript 4.4 now flags both.
For more information, read up on the original change .

### Abstract Properties Do Not Allow Initializers

The following code is now an error because abstract properties may not have initializers:



```id
tsabstract class C {  abstract prop = 1;  //       ~~~~  // Property 'prop' cannot have an initializer because it is marked abstract.}
```



Instead, you may only specify a type for the property:



```id
tsabstract class C {  abstract prop: number;}
```

# TypeScript 3.6

 

## Stricter Generators

TypeScript 3.6 introduces stricter checking for iterators and generator functions.
In earlier versions, users of generators had no way to differentiate whether a value was yielded or returned from a generator.



```id
tsfunction* foo() {  if (Math.random() < 0.5) yield 100;  return "Finished!";}let iter = foo();let curr = iter.next();if (curr.done) {  // TypeScript 3.5 and prior thought this was a 'string | number'.  // It should know it's 'string' since 'done' was 'true'!  curr.value;}
```



Additionally, generators just assumed the type of `yield` was always `any`.



```id
tsfunction* bar() {  let x: { hello(): void } = yield;  x.hello();}let iter = bar();iter.next();iter.next(123); // oops! runtime error!
```



In TypeScript 3.6, the checker now knows that the correct type for `curr.value` should be `string` in our first example, and will correctly error on our call to `next()` in our last example.
This is thanks to some changes in the `Iterator` and `IteratorResult` type declarations to include a few new type parameters, and to a new type that TypeScript uses to represent generators called the `Generator` type.

The `Iterator` type now allows users to specify the yielded type, the returned type, and the type that `next` can accept.



```id
tsinterface Iterator<T, TReturn = any, TNext = undefined> {  // Takes either 0 or 1 arguments - doesn't accept 'undefined'  next(...args: [] | [TNext]): IteratorResult<T, TReturn>;  return?(value?: TReturn): IteratorResult<T, TReturn>;  throw?(e?: any): IteratorResult<T, TReturn>;}
```



Building on that work, the new `Generator` type is an `Iterator` that always has both the `return` and `throw` methods present, and is also iterable.



```id
tsinterface Generator<T = unknown, TReturn = any, TNext = unknown>  extends Iterator<T, TReturn, TNext> {  next(...args: [] | [TNext]): IteratorResult<T, TReturn>;  return(value: TReturn): IteratorResult<T, TReturn>;  throw(e: any): IteratorResult<T, TReturn>;  [Symbol.iterator](): Generator<T, TReturn, TNext>;}
```



To allow differentiation between returned values and yielded values, TypeScript 3.6 converts the `IteratorResult` type to a discriminated union type:



```id
tstype IteratorResult<T, TReturn = any> =  | IteratorYieldResult<T>  | IteratorReturnResult<TReturn>;interface IteratorYieldResult<TYield> {  done?: false;  value: TYield;}interface IteratorReturnResult<TReturn> {  done: true;  value: TReturn;}
```



In short, what this means is that you’ll be able to appropriately narrow down values from iterators when dealing with them directly.

To correctly represent the types that can be passed in to a generator from calls to `next()`, TypeScript 3.6 also infers certain uses of `yield` within the body of a generator function.



```id
tsfunction* foo() {  let x: string = yield;  console.log(x.toUpperCase());}let x = foo();x.next(); // first call to 'next' is always ignoredx.next(42); // error! 'number' is not assignable to 'string'
```



If you’d prefer to be explicit, you can also enforce the type of values that can be returned, yielded, and evaluated from `yield` expressions using an explicit return type.
Below, `next()` can only be called with `boolean`s, and depending on the value of `done`, `value` is either a `string` or a `number`.



```id
ts/** * - yields numbers * - returns strings * - can be passed in booleans */function* counter(): Generator<number, string, boolean> {  let i = 0;  while (true) {    if (yield i++) {      break;    }  }  return "done!";}var iter = counter();var curr = iter.next();while (!curr.done) {  console.log(curr.value);  curr = iter.next(curr.value === 5);}console.log(curr.value.toUpperCase());// prints://// 0// 1// 2// 3// 4// 5// DONE!
```



For more details on the change, see the pull request here .

## More Accurate Array Spread

In pre-ES2015 targets, the most faithful emit for constructs like `for`/`of` loops and array spreads can be a bit heavy.
For this reason, TypeScript uses a simpler emit by default that only supports array types, and supports iterating on other types using the `downlevelIteration` flag.
The looser default without `downlevelIteration` works fairly well; however, there were some common cases where the transformation of array spreads had observable differences.
For example, the following array containing a spread



```id
ts[...Array(5)];
```



can be rewritten as the following array literal



```id
js[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined];
```



However, TypeScript would instead transform the original code into this code:



```id
tsArray(5).slice();
```



which is slightly different.
`Array(5)` produces an array with a length of 5, but with no defined property slots.

TypeScript 3.6 introduces a new `__spreadArrays` helper to accurately model what happens in ECMAScript 2015 in older targets outside of `downlevelIteration` .
`__spreadArrays` is also available in tslib .

For more information, see the relevant pull request .

## Improved UX Around Promises

TypeScript 3.6 introduces some improvements for when `Promise`s are mis-handled.

For example, it’s often very common to forget to `.then()` or `await` the contents of a `Promise` before passing it to another function.
TypeScript’s error messages are now specialized, and inform the user that perhaps they should consider using the `await` keyword.



```id
tsinterface User {  name: string;  age: number;  location: string;}declare function getUserData(): Promise<User>;declare function displayUser(user: User): void;async function f() {  displayUser(getUserData());  //              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  // Argument of type 'Promise<User>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'User'.  //   ...  // Did you forget to use 'await'?}
```



It’s also common to try to access a method before `await`-ing or `.then()`-ing a `Promise`.
This is another example, among many others, where we’re able to do better.



```id
tsasync function getCuteAnimals() {  fetch("https://reddit.com/r/aww.json").json();  //   ~~~~  // Property 'json' does not exist on type 'Promise<Response>'.  //  // Did you forget to use 'await'?}
```



For more details, see the originating issue , as well as the pull requests that link back to it.

## Better Unicode Support for Identifiers

TypeScript 3.6 contains better support for Unicode characters in identifiers when emitting to ES2015 and later targets.



```id
tsconst 𝓱𝓮𝓵𝓵𝓸 = "world"; // previously disallowed, now allowed in '--target es2015'
```



## `import.meta` Support in SystemJS

TypeScript 3.6 supports transforming `import.meta` to `context.meta` when your `module` target is set to `system`.



```id
ts// This module:console.log(import.meta.url);// gets turned into the following:System.register([], function (exports, context) {  return {    setters: [],    execute: function () {      console.log(context.meta.url);    },  };});
```



## `get` and `set` Accessors Are Allowed in Ambient Contexts

In previous versions of TypeScript, the language didn’t allow `get` and `set` accessors in ambient contexts (like in `declare`-d classes, or in `.d.ts` files in general).
The rationale was that accessors weren’t distinct from properties as far as writing and reading to these properties;
however, because ECMAScript’s class fields proposal may have differing behavior from in existing versions of TypeScript , we realized we needed a way to communicate this different behavior to provide appropriate errors in subclasses.

As a result, users can write getters and setters in ambient contexts in TypeScript 3.6.



```id
tsdeclare class Foo {  // Allowed in 3.6+.  get x(): number;  set x(val: number);}
```



In TypeScript 3.7, the compiler itself will take advantage of this feature so that generated `.d.ts` files will also emit `get`/`set` accessors.

## Ambient Classes and Functions Can Merge

In previous versions of TypeScript, it was an error to merge classes and functions under any circumstances.
Now, ambient classes and functions (classes/functions with the `declare` modifier, or in `.d.ts` files) can merge.
This means that now you can write the following:



```id
tsexport declare function Point2D(x: number, y: number): Point2D;export declare class Point2D {  x: number;  y: number;  constructor(x: number, y: number);}
```



instead of needing to use



```id
tsexport interface Point2D {  x: number;  y: number;}export declare var Point2D: {  (x: number, y: number): Point2D;  new (x: number, y: number): Point2D;};
```



One advantage of this is that the callable constructor pattern can be easily expressed while also allowing namespaces to merge with these declarations (since `var` declarations can’t merge with `namespace`s).

In TypeScript 3.7, the compiler will take advantage of this feature so that `.d.ts` files generated from `.js` files can appropriately capture both the callability and constructability of a class-like function.

For more details, see the original PR on GitHub .

## APIs to Support `--build` and `--incremental`

TypeScript 3.0 introduced support for referencing other projects and building them incrementally using the `--build` flag.
Additionally, TypeScript 3.4 introduced the `incremental` flag for saving information about previous compilations to only rebuild certain files.
These flags were incredibly useful for structuring projects more flexibly and speeding builds up.
Unfortunately, using these flags didn’t work with 3rd party build tools like Gulp and Webpack.
TypeScript 3.6 now exposes two sets of APIs to operate on project references and incremental program building.

For creating `incremental` builds, users can leverage the `createIncrementalProgram` and `createIncrementalCompilerHost` APIs.
Users can also re-hydrate old program instances from `.tsbuildinfo` files generated by this API using the newly exposed `readBuilderProgram` function, which is only meant to be used as for creating new programs (i.e. you can’t modify the returned instance - it’s only meant to be used for the `oldProgram` parameter in other `create*Program` functions).

For leveraging project references, a new `createSolutionBuilder` function has been exposed, which returns an instance of the new type `SolutionBuilder`.

For more details on these APIs, you can see the original pull request .

## Semicolon-Aware Code Edits

Editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code can automatically apply quick fixes, refactorings, and other transformations like automatically importing values from other modules.
These transformations are powered by TypeScript, and older versions of TypeScript unconditionally added semicolons to the end of every statement; unfortunately, this disagreed with many users’ style guidelines, and many users were displeased with the editor inserting semicolons.

TypeScript is now smart enough to detect whether your file uses semicolons when applying these sorts of edits.
If your file generally lacks semicolons, TypeScript won’t add one.

For more details, see the corresponding pull request .

## Smarter Auto-Import Syntax

JavaScript has a lot of different module syntaxes or conventions: the one in the ECMAScript standard, the one Node already supports (CommonJS), AMD, System.js, and more!
For the most part, TypeScript would default to auto-importing using ECMAScript module syntax, which was often inappropriate in certain TypeScript projects with different compiler settings, or in Node projects with plain JavaScript and `require` calls.

TypeScript 3.6 is now a bit smarter about looking at your existing imports before deciding on how to auto-import other modules.
You can see more details in the original pull request here .

## New TypeScript Playground

The TypeScript playground has received a much-needed refresh with handy new functionality!
The new playground is largely a fork of Artem Tyurin ’s TypeScript playground which community members have been using more and more.
We owe Artem a big thanks for helping out here!

The new playground now supports many new options including:

 The `target` option (allowing users to switch out of `es5` to `es3`, `es2015`, `esnext`, etc.)

- All the strictness flags (including just `strict` )

- Support for plain JavaScript files (using `allowJS` and optionally `checkJs` )

These options also persist when sharing links to playground samples, allowing users to more reliably share examples without having to tell the recipient “oh, don’t forget to turn on the `noImplicitAny` option!“.

In the near future, we’re going to be refreshing the playground samples, adding JSX support, and polishing automatic type acquisition, meaning that you’ll be able to see the same experience on the playground as you’d get in your personal editor.

As we improve the playground and the website, we welcome feedback and pull requests on GitHub !

# TypeScript 4.3

 

## Separate Write Types on Properties

In JavaScript, it’s pretty common for APIs to convert values that are passed in before storing them.
This often happens with getters and setters too.
For example, let’s imagine we’ve got a class with a setter that always converts a value into a `number` before saving it in a private field.



```id
jsclass Thing {  #size = 0;   get size() {    return this.#size;  }  set size(value) {    let num =  number' >Number(value);     // Don&apos;t allow NaN and stuff.    if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {      this.#size = 0;      return;    }     this.#size = num;  }}Try
```



How would we type this JavaScript code in TypeScript?
Well, technically we don’t have to do anything special here - TypeScript can look at this with no explicit types and can figure out that `size` is a number.

The problem is that `size` allows you to assign more than just `number`s to it.
We could get around this by saying that `size` has the type `unknown` or `any` like in this snippet:



```id
tsclass Thing {  // ...  get size(): unknown {    return this.#size;  }}
```



But that’s no good - `unknown` forces people reading `size` to do a type assertion, and `any` won’t catch any mistakes.
If we really want to model APIs that convert values, previous versions of TypeScript forced us to pick between being precise (which makes reading values easier, and writing harder) and being permissive (which makes writing values easier, and reading harder).

That’s why TypeScript 4.3 allows you to specify types for reading and writing to properties.



```id
tsclass Thing {  #size = 0;   get size(): number {    return this.#size;  }   set size(value: string | number | boolean) {    let num =  number' >Number(value);     // Don&apos;t allow NaN and stuff.    if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {      this.#size = 0;      return;    }     this.#size = num;  }}Try
```



In the above example, our `set` accessor takes a broader set of types (`string`s, `boolean`s, and `number`s), but our `get` accessor always guarantees it will be a `number`.
Now we can finally assign other types to these properties with no errors!



```id
tslet thing = new Thing(); // Assigning other types to `thing.size` works!thing.size = "hello";thing.size = true;thing.size = 42; // Reading `thing.size` always produces a number!let mySize: number = thing.size;Try
```



When considering how two properties with the same name relate to each other, TypeScript will only use the “reading” type (e.g. the type on the `get` accessor above).
“Writing” types are only considered when directly writing to a property.

Keep in mind, this isn’t a pattern that’s limited to classes.
You can write getters and setters with different types in object literals.



```id
tsfunction makeThing(): Thing {  let size = 0;  return {    get size(): number {      return size;    },    set size(value: string | number | boolean) {      let num = Number(value);      // Don't allow NaN and stuff.      if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {        size = 0;        return;      }      size = num;    },  };}
```



In fact, we’ve added syntax to interfaces/object types to support different reading/writing types on properties.



```id
ts// Now valid!interface Thing {    get size(): number    set size(value: number | string | boolean);}
```



One limitation of using different types for reading and writing properties is that the type for reading a property has to be assignable to the type that you’re writing.
In other words, the getter type has to be assignable to the setter.
This ensures some level of consistency, so that a property is always assignable to itself.

For more information on this feature, take a look at the implementing pull request .

## `override` and the `--noImplicitOverride` Flag

When extending classes in JavaScript, the language makes it super easy (pun intended) to override methods - but unfortunately, there are some mistakes that you can run into.

One big one is missing renames.
For example, take the following classes:



```id
tsclass SomeComponent {  show() {    // ...  }  hide() {    // ...  }}class SpecializedComponent extends SomeComponent {  show() {    // ...  }  hide() {    // ...  }}
```



`SpecializedComponent` subclasses `SomeComponent`, and overrides the `show` and `hide` methods.
What happens if someone decides to rip out `show` and `hide` and replace them with a single method?



```id
diff class SomeComponent {-    show() {-        // ...-    }-    hide() {-        // ...-    }+    setVisible(value: boolean) {+        // ...+    } } class SpecializedComponent extends SomeComponent {     show() {         // ...     }     hide() {         // ...     } }
```



 Oh no! 
Our `SpecializedComponent` didn’t get updated.
Now it’s just adding these two useless `show` and `hide` methods that probably won’t get called.

Part of the issue here is that a user can’t make it clear whether they meant to add a new method, or to override an existing one.
That’s why TypeScript 4.3 adds the `override` keyword.



```id
tsclass SpecializedComponent extends SomeComponent {    override show() {        // ...    }    override hide() {        // ...    }}
```



When a method is marked with `override`, TypeScript will always make sure that a method with the same name exists in a the base class.



```id
tsclass SomeComponent {    setVisible(value: boolean) {        // ...    }}class SpecializedComponent extends SomeComponent {    override show() {This member cannot have an 'override' modifier because it is not declared in the base class 'SomeComponent'.4113This member cannot have an 'override' modifier because it is not declared in the base class 'SomeComponent'.     }}Try
```



This is a big improvement, but it doesn’t help if you forget to write `override` on a method - and that’s a big mistake users can run into also.

For example, you might accidentally “trample over” a method that exists in a base class without realizing it.



```id
tsclass Base {  someHelperMethod() {    // ...  }}class Derived extends Base {  // Oops! We weren't trying to override here,  // we just needed to write a local helper method.  someHelperMethod() {    // ...  }}
```



That’s why TypeScript 4.3 also provides a new `noImplicitOverride` flag.
When this option is turned on, it becomes an error to override any method from a superclass unless you explicitly use an `override` keyword.
In that last example, TypeScript would error under `noImplicitOverride` , and give us a clue that we probably need to rename our method inside of `Derived`.

We’d like to extend our thanks to our community for the implementation here.
The work for these items was implemented in a pull request by Wenlu Wang , though an earlier pull request implementing only the `override` keyword by Paul Cody Johnston served as a basis for direction and discussion.
We extend our gratitude for putting in the time for these features.

## Template String Type Improvements

In recent versions, TypeScript introduced a new type construct: template string types.
These are types that either construct new string-like types by concatenating…



```id
tstype Color = "red" | "blue";type Quantity = "one" | "two";type SeussFish = `${Quantity | Color} fish`;// same as//   type SeussFish = "one fish" | "two fish"//                  | "red fish" | "blue fish";
```



…or match patterns of other string-like types.



```id
tsdeclare let s1: `${number}-${number}-${number}`;declare let s2: `1-2-3`;// Works!s1 = s2;
```



The first change we made is just in when TypeScript will infer a template string type.
When a template string is contextually typed by a string-literal-like type (i.e. when TypeScript sees we’re passing a template string to something that takes a literal type) it will try to give that expression a template type.



```id
tsfunction bar(s: string): `hello ${string}` {    // Previously an error, now works!    return `hello ${s}`;}
```



This also kicks in when inferring types, and the type parameter `extends string`



```id
tsdeclare let s: string;declare function f<T extends string>(x: T): T;// Previously: string// Now       : `hello ${string}`let x2 = f(`hello ${s}`);
```



The second major change here is that TypeScript can now better-relate, and infer between , different template string types.

To see this, take the following example code:



```id
tsdeclare let s1: `${number}-${number}-${number}`;declare let s2: `1-2-3`;declare let s3: `${number}-2-3`;s1 = s2;s1 = s3;
```



When checking against a string literal type like on `s2`, TypeScript could match against the string contents and figure out that `s2` was compatible with `s1` in the first assignment;
however, as soon as it saw another template string, it just gave up.
As a result, assignments like `s3` to `s1` just didn’t work.

TypeScript now actually does the work to prove whether or not each part of a template string can successfully match.
You can now mix and match template strings with different substitutions and TypeScript will do a good job to figure out whether they’re really compatible.



```id
tsdeclare let s1: `${number}-${number}-${number}`;declare let s2: `1-2-3`;declare let s3: `${number}-2-3`;declare let s4: `1-${number}-3`;declare let s5: `1-2-${number}`;declare let s6: `${number}-2-${number}`;// Now *all of these* work!s1 = s2;s1 = s3;s1 = s4;s1 = s5;s1 = s6;
```



In doing this work, we were also sure to add better inference capabilities.
You can see an example of these in action:



```id
tsdeclare function foo<V extends string>(arg: `*${V}*`): V;function test<T extends string>(s: string, n: number, b: boolean, t: T) {    let x1 = foo("*hello*");            // "hello"    let x2 = foo("**hello**");          // "*hello*"    let x3 = foo(`*${s}*` as const);    // string    let x4 = foo(`*${n}*` as const);    // `${number}`    let x5 = foo(`*${b}*` as const);    // "true" | "false"    let x6 = foo(`*${t}*` as const);    // `${T}`    let x7 = foo(`**${s}**` as const);  // `*${string}*`}
```

## ECMAScript `#private` Class Elements

TypeScript 4.3 expands which elements in a class can be given `#private` `#names` to make them truly private at run-time.
In addition to properties, methods and accessors can also be given private names.



```id
tsclass Foo {  #someMethod() {    //...  }  get #someValue() {    return 100;  }  publicMethod() {    // These work.    // We can access private-named members inside this class.    this.#someMethod();    return this.#someValue;  }}new Foo().#someMethod();//        ~~~~~~~~~~~// error!// Property '#someMethod' is not accessible// outside class 'Foo' because it has a private identifier.new Foo().#someValue;//        ~~~~~~~~~~// error!// Property '#someValue' is not accessible// outside class 'Foo' because it has a private identifier.
```



Even more broadly, static members can now also have private names.



```id
tsclass Foo {  static #someMethod() {    // ...  }}Foo.#someMethod();//  ~~~~~~~~~~~// error!// Property '#someMethod' is not accessible// outside class 'Foo' because it has a private identifier.
```



This feature was authored in a pull request from our friends at Bloomberg - written by Titian Cernicova-Dragomir and Kubilay Kahveci , with support and expertise from Joey Watts , Rob Palmer , and Tim McClure .
We’d like to extend our thanks to all of them!

## `ConstructorParameters` Works on Abstract Classes

In TypeScript 4.3, the `ConstructorParameters` type helper now works on `abstract` classes.



```id
tsabstract class C {  constructor(a: string, b: number) {    // ...  }}// Has the type '[a: string, b: number]'.type CParams = ConstructorParameters<typeof C>;
```



This is thanks to work done in TypeScript 4.2, where construct signatures can be marked as abstract:



```id
tstype MyConstructorOf<T> = {    abstract new(...args: any[]): T;}// or using the shorthand syntax:type MyConstructorOf<T> = abstract new (...args: any[]) => T;
```



You can see the change in more detail on GitHub .

## Contextual Narrowing for Generics

TypeScript 4.3 now includes some slightly smarter type-narrowing logic on generic values.
This allows TypeScript to accept more patterns, and sometimes even catch mistakes.

For some motivation, let’s say we’re trying to write a function called `makeUnique`.
It’ll take a `Set` or an `Array` of elements, and if it’s given an `Array`, it’ll sort that `Array` remove duplicates according to some comparison function.
After all that, it will return the original collection.



```id
tsfunction makeUnique<T>(  collection: Set<T> | T[],  comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): Set<T> | T[] {  // Early bail-out if we have a Set.  // We assume the elements are already unique.  if (collection instanceof Set) {    return collection;  }  // Sort the array, then remove consecutive duplicates.  collection.sort(comparer);  for (let i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {    let j = i;    while (      j < collection.length &&      comparer(collection[i], collection[j + 1]) === 0    ) {      j++;    }    collection.splice(i + 1, j - i);  }  return collection;}
```



Let’s leave questions about this function’s implementation aside, and assume it arose from the requirements of a broader application.
Something that you might notice is that the signature doesn’t capture the original type of `collection`.
We can do that by adding a type parameter called `C` in place of where we’ve written `Set | T[]`.



```id
diff- function makeUnique<T>(collection: Set<T> | T[], comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): Set<T> | T[]+ function makeUnique<T, C extends Set<T> | T[]>(collection: C, comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): C
```



In TypeScript 4.2 and earlier, you’d end up with a bunch of errors as soon as you tried this.



```id
tsfunction makeUnique<T, C extends Set<T> | T[]>(  collection: C,  comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): C {  // Early bail-out if we have a Set.  // We assume the elements are already unique.  if (collection instanceof Set) {    return collection;  }  // Sort the array, then remove consecutive duplicates.  collection.sort(comparer);  //         ~~~~  // error: Property 'sort' does not exist on type 'C'.  for (let i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {    //                             ~~~~~~    // error: Property 'length' does not exist on type 'C'.    let j = i;    while (      j < collection.length &&      comparer(collection[i], collection[j + 1]) === 0    ) {      //                    ~~~~~~      // error: Property 'length' does not exist on type 'C'.      //                                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      // error: Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'number'      //        can't be used to index type 'Set<T> | T[]'.      j++;    }    collection.splice(i + 1, j - i);    //         ~~~~~~    // error: Property 'splice' does not exist on type 'C'.  }  return collection;}
```



Ew, errors!
Why is TypeScript being so mean to us?

The issue is that when we perform our `collection instanceof Set` check, we’re expecting that to act as a type guard that narrows the type from `Set | T[]` to `Set ` and `T[]` depending on the branch we’re in;
however, we’re not dealing with a `Set | T[]`, we’re trying to narrow the generic value `collection`, whose type is `C`.

It’s a very subtle distinction, but it makes a difference.
TypeScript can’t just grab the constraint of `C` (which is `Set | T[]`) and narrow that.
If TypeScript did try to narrow from `Set | T[]`, it would forget that `collection` is also a `C` in each branch because there’s no easy way to preserve that information.
If hypothetically TypeScript tried that approach, it would break the above example in a different way.
At the return positions, where the function expects values with the type `C`, we would instead get a `Set ` and a `T[]` in each branch, which TypeScript would reject.



```id
tsfunction makeUnique<T>(  collection: Set<T> | T[],  comparer: (x: T, y: T) => number): Set<T> | T[] {  // Early bail-out if we have a Set.  // We assume the elements are already unique.  if (collection instanceof Set) {    return collection;    //     ~~~~~~~~~~    // error: Type 'Set<T>' is not assignable to type 'C'.    //          'Set<T>' is assignable to the constraint of type 'C', but    //          'C' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint 'Set<T> | T[]'.  }  // ...  return collection;  //     ~~~~~~~~~~  // error: Type 'T[]' is not assignable to type 'C'.  //          'T[]' is assignable to the constraint of type 'C', but  //          'C' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint 'Set<T> | T[]'.}
```



So how does TypeScript 4.3 change things?
Well, basically in a few key places when writing code, all the type system really cares about is the constraint of a type.
For example, when we write `collection.length`, TypeScript doesn’t care about the fact that `collection` has the type `C`, it only cares about the properties available, which are determined by the constraint `T[] | Set `.

In cases like this, TypeScript will grab the narrowed type of the constraint because that will give you the data you care about;
however, in any other case, we’ll just try to narrow the original generic type (and often end up with the original generic type).

In other words, based on how you use a generic value, TypeScript will narrow it a little differently.
The end result is that the entire above example compiles with no type-checking errors.

For more details, you can look at the original pull request on GitHub .

## Always-Truthy Promise Checks

Under `strictNullChecks` , checking whether a `Promise` is “truthy” in a conditional will trigger an error.



```id
tsasync function foo(): Promise<boolean> {  return false;}async function bar(): Promise<string> {  if (foo()) {    //  ~~~~~    // Error!    // This condition will always return true since    // this 'Promise<boolean>' appears to always be defined.    // Did you forget to use 'await'?    return "true";  }  return "false";}
```



 This change was contributed by Jack Works , and we extend our thanks to them!

## `static` Index Signatures

Index signatures allow us to set more properties on a value than a type explicitly declares.



```id
tsclass Foo {  hello = "hello";  world = 1234;  // This is an index signature:  [propName: string]: string | number | undefined;}let instance = new Foo();// Valid assignmentinstance["whatever"] = 42;// Has type 'string | number | undefined'.let x = instance["something"];
```



Up until now, an index signature could only be declared on the instance side of a class.
Thanks to a pull request from Wenlu Wang , index signatures can now be declared as `static`.



```id
tsclass Foo {  static hello = "hello";  static world = 1234;  static [propName: string]: string | number | undefined;}// Valid.Foo["whatever"] = 42;// Has type 'string | number | undefined'let x = Foo["something"];
```



The same sorts of rules apply for index signatures on the static side of a class as they do for the instance side - namely, that every other static property has to be compatible with the index signature.



```id
tsclass Foo {  static prop = true;  //     ~~~~  // Error! Property 'prop' of type 'boolean'  // is not assignable to string index type  // 'string | number | undefined'.  static [propName: string]: string | number | undefined;}
```



## `.tsbuildinfo` Size Improvements

In TypeScript 4.3, `.tsbuildinfo` files that are generated as part of `incremental` builds should be significantly smaller.
This is thanks to several optimizations in the internal format, creating tables with numeric identifiers to be used throughout the file instead of repeating full paths and similar information.
This work was spear-headed by Tobias Koppers in their pull request , serving as inspiration for the ensuing pull request and further optimizations .

We have seen significant reductions of `.tsbuildinfo` file sizes including

 1MB to 411 KB

- 14.9MB to 1MB

- 1345MB to 467MB

Needless to say, these sorts of savings in size translate to slightly faster build times as well.

## Lazier Calculations in `--incremental` and `--watch` Compilations

One of the issues with `incremental` and `--watch` modes are that while they make later compilations go faster, the initial compilation can be a bit slower - in some cases, significantly slower.
This is because these modes have to perform a bunch of book-keeping, computing information about the current project, and sometimes saving that data in a `.tsbuildinfo` file for later builds.

That’s why on top of `.tsbuildinfo` size improvements, TypeScript 4.3 also ships some changes to `incremental` and `--watch` modes that make the first build of a project with these flags just as fast as an ordinary build!
To do this, much of the information that would ordinarily be computed up-front is instead done on an on-demand basis for later builds.
While this can add some overhead to a subsequent build, TypeScript’s `incremental` and `--watch` functionality will still typically operate on a much smaller set of files, and any needed information will be saved afterwards.
In a sense, `incremental` and `--watch` builds will “warm up” and get faster at compiling files once you’ve updated them a few times.

In a repository with 3000 files, this reduced initial build times to almost a third !

 This work was started by Tobias Koppers , whose work ensued in the resulting final change for this functionality.
We’d like to extend a great thanks to Tobias for helping us find these opportunities for improvements!

## Import Statement Completions

One of the biggest pain-points users run into with import and export statements in JavaScript is the order - specifically that imports are written as



```id
tsimport { func } from "./module.js";
```



instead of



```id
tsfrom "./module.js" import { func };
```



This causes some pain when writing out a full import statement from scratch because auto-complete wasn’t able to work correctly.
For example, if you start writing something like `import {`, TypeScript has no idea what module you’re planning on importing from, so it couldn’t provide any scoped-down completions.

To alleviate this, we’ve leveraged the power of auto-imports!
Auto-imports already deal with the issue of not being able to narrow down completions from a specific module - their whole point is to provide every possible export and automatically insert an import statement at the top of your file.

So when you now start writing an `import` statement that doesn’t have a path, we’ll provide you with a list of possible imports.
When you commit a completion, we’ll complete the full import statement, including the path that you were going to write.

 

This work requires editors that specifically support the feature.
You’ll be able to try this out by using the latest Insiders versions of Visual Studio Code .

For more information, take a look at the implementing pull request !

## Editor Support for `@link` Tags

TypeScript can now understand `@link` tags, and will try to resolve declarations that they link to.
What this means is that you’ll be able to hover over names within `@link` tags and get quick information, or use commands like go-to-definition or find-all-references.

For example, you’ll be able to go-to-definition on `plantCarrot` in `@link plantCarrot` in the example below and a TypeScript-supported editor will jump to `plantCarrot`’s function declaration.



```id
ts/** * To be called 70 to 80 days after {@link plantCarrot}. */function harvestCarrot(carrot: Carrot) {}/** * Call early in spring for best results. Added in v2.1.0. * @param seed Make sure it's a carrot seed! */function plantCarrot(seed: Seed) {  // TODO: some gardening}
```



 

For more information, see the pull request on GitHub !

## Go-to-Definition on Non-JavaScript File Paths

Many loaders allow users to include assets in their applications using JavaScript imports.
They’ll typically be written as something like `import "./styles.css"` or the like.

Up until now, TypeScript’s editor functionality wouldn’t even attempt to read this file, so go-to-definition would typically fail.
At best, go-to-definition would jump to a declaration like `declare module "*.css"` if it could find something along those lines.

TypeScript’s language service now tries to jump to the correct file when you perform a go-to-definition on relative file paths, even if they’re not JavaScript or TypeScript files!
Try it out with imports to CSS, SVGs, PNGs, font files, Vue files, and more.

For more information, you can check out the implementing pull request .

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

As with every TypeScript version, declarations for `lib.d.ts` (especially the declarations generated for web contexts), have changed.
In this release, we leveraged Mozilla’s browser-compat-data to remove APIs that no browser implements.
While it is unlike that you are using them, APIs such as `Account`, `AssertionOptions`, `RTCStatsEventInit`, `MSGestureEvent`, `DeviceLightEvent`, `MSPointerEvent`, `ServiceWorkerMessageEvent`, and `WebAuthentication` have all been removed from `lib.d.ts`.
This is discussed in some detail here .

 https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-DOM-lib-generator/issues/991 

### `useDefineForClassFields` now defaults to true on `esnext` and eventually on `es2022`

In 2021 the class fields feature was added into the JavaScript specification with behavior which differed from how TypeScript had implemented it. In preparation for this, in TypeScript 3.7, a flag was added ( `useDefineForClassFields` ) to migrate to emitted JavaScript to match the JavaScript standard behavior.

Now that the feature is in JavaScript we are changing the default to `true` for ES2022 and above, including ESNext.

### Errors on Always-Truthy Promise Checks

Under `strictNullChecks` , using a `Promise` that always appears to be defined within a condition check is now considered an error.



```id
tsdeclare var p: Promise<number>;if (p) {  //  ~  // Error!  // This condition will always return true since  // this 'Promise<number>' appears to always be defined.  //  // Did you forget to use 'await'?}
```



For more details, see the original change .

### Union Enums Cannot Be Compared to Arbitrary Numbers

Certain `enum`s are considered union `enum`s when their members are either automatically filled in, or trivially written.
In those cases, an enum can recall each value that it potentially represents.

In TypeScript 4.3, if a value with a union `enum` type is compared with a numeric literal that it could never be equal to, then the type-checker will issue an error.



```id
tsenum E {  A = 0,  B = 1,}function doSomething(x: E) {  // Error! This condition will always return 'false' since the types 'E' and '-1' have no overlap.  if (x === -1) {    // ...  }}
```



As a workaround, you can re-write an annotation to include the appropriate literal type.



```id
tsenum E {  A = 0,  B = 1,}// Include -1 in the type, if we're really certain that -1 can come through.function doSomething(x: E | -1) {  if (x === -1) {    // ...  }}
```



You can also use a type-assertion on the value.



```id
tsenum E {  A = 0,  B = 1,}function doSomething(x: E) {  // Use a type assertion on 'x' because we know we're not actually just dealing with values from 'E'.  if ((x as number) === -1) {    // ...  }}
```



Alternatively, you can re-declare your enum to have a non-trivial initializer so that any number is both assignable and comparable to that enum. This may be useful if the intent is for the enum to specify a few well-known values.



```id
tsenum E {  // the leading + on 0 opts TypeScript out of inferring a union enum.  A = +0,  B = 1,}
```

# TypeScript 3.5

 

## Speed improvements

TypeScript 3.5 introduces several optimizations around type-checking and incremental builds.

### Type-checking speed-ups

TypeScript 3.5 contains certain optimizations over TypeScript 3.4 for type-checking more efficiently.
These improvements are significantly more pronounced in editor scenarios where type-checking drives operations like code completion lists.

### `--incremental` improvements

TypeScript 3.5 improves on 3.4’s `incremental` build mode, by saving information about how the state of the world was calculated - compiler settings, why files were looked up, where files were found, etc.
In scenarios involving hundreds of projects using TypeScript’s project references in `--build` mode, we’ve found that the amount of time rebuilding can be reduced by as much as 68% compared to TypeScript 3.4 !

For more details, you can see the pull requests to

 cache module resolution 

- cache settings calculated from `tsconfig.json` 

## The `Omit` helper type

TypeScript 3.5 introduces the new `Omit` helper type, which creates a new type with some properties dropped from the original.



```id
tstype Person = {  name: string;  age: number;  location: string;};type QuantumPerson = Omit<Person, "location">;// equivalent totype QuantumPerson = {  name: string;  age: number;};
```



Here we were able to copy over all the properties of `Person` except for `location` using the `Omit` helper.

For more details, see the pull request on GitHub to add `Omit` , as well as the change to use `Omit` for object rest .

### Improved excess property checks in union types

In TypeScript 3.4 and earlier, certain excess properties were allowed in situations where they really shouldn’t have been.
For instance, TypeScript 3.4 permitted the incorrect `name` property in the object literal even though its types don’t match between `Point` and `Label`.



```id
tstype Point = {  x: number;  y: number;};type Label = {  name: string;};const thing: Point | Label = {  x: 0,  y: 0,  name: true // uh-oh!};
```



Previously, a non-discriminated union wouldn’t have any excess property checking done on its members, and as a result, the incorrectly typed `name` property slipped by.

In TypeScript 3.5, the type-checker at least verifies that all the provided properties belong to some union member and have the appropriate type, meaning that the sample above correctly issues an error.

Note that partial overlap is still permitted as long as the property types are valid.



```id
tsconst pl: Point | Label = {  x: 0,  y: 0,  name: "origin" // okay};
```



## The `--allowUmdGlobalAccess` flag

In TypeScript 3.5, you can now reference UMD global declarations like



```
export as namespace foo;
```



from anywhere - even modules - using the new `allowUmdGlobalAccess` flag.

This mode adds flexibility for mixing and matching the way 3rd party libraries, where globals that libraries declare can always be consumed, even from within modules.

For more details, see the pull request on GitHub .

## Smarter union type checking

In TypeScript 3.4 and prior, the following example would fail:



```id
tstype S = { done: boolean; value: number };type T = { done: false; value: number } | { done: true; value: number };declare let source: S;declare let target: T;target = source;
```



That’s because `S` isn’t assignable to `{ done: false, value: number }` nor `{ done: true, value: number }`.
Why?
Because the `done` property in `S` isn’t specific enough - it’s `boolean` whereas each constituent of `T` has a `done` property that’s specifically `true` or `false`.
That’s what we meant by each constituent type being checked in isolation: TypeScript doesn’t just union each property together and see if `S` is assignable to that.
If it did, some bad code could get through like the following:



```id
tsinterface Foo {  kind: "foo";  value: string;}interface Bar {  kind: "bar";  value: number;}function doSomething(x: Foo | Bar) {  if (x.kind === "foo") {    x.value.toLowerCase();  }}// uh-oh - luckily TypeScript errors here!doSomething({  kind: "foo",  value: 123});
```



However, this was a bit overly strict for the original example.
If you figure out the precise type of any possible value of `S`, you can actually see that it matches the types in `T` exactly.

In TypeScript 3.5, when assigning to types with discriminant properties like in `T`, the language actually will go further and decompose types like `S` into a union of every possible inhabitant type.
In this case, since `boolean` is a union of `true` and `false`, `S` will be viewed as a union of `{ done: false, value: number }` and `{ done: true, value: number }`.

For more details, you can see the original pull request on GitHub .

## Higher order type inference from generic constructors

In TypeScript 3.4, we improved inference for when generic functions that return functions like so:



```id
tsfunction compose<T, U, V>(f: (x: T) => U, g: (y: U) => V): (x: T) => V {  return x => g(f(x));}
```



took other generic functions as arguments, like so:



```id
tsfunction arrayify<T>(x: T): T[] {  return [x];}type Box<U> = { value: U };function boxify<U>(y: U): Box<U> {  return { value: y };}let newFn = compose(arrayify, boxify);
```



Instead of a relatively useless type like `(x: {}) => Box `, which older versions of the language would infer, TypeScript 3.4’s inference allows `newFn` to be generic.
Its new type is ` (x: T) => Box `.

TypeScript 3.5 generalizes this behavior to work on constructor functions as well.



```id
tsclass Box<T> {  kind: "box";  value: T;  constructor(value: T) {    this.value = value;  }}class Bag<U> {  kind: "bag";  value: U;  constructor(value: U) {    this.value = value;  }}function composeCtor<T, U, V>(  F: new (x: T) => U,  G: new (y: U) => V): (x: T) => V {  return x => new G(new F(x));}let f = composeCtor(Box, Bag); // has type '<T>(x: T) => Bag<Box<T>>'let a = f(1024); // has type 'Bag<Box<number>>'
```



In addition to compositional patterns like the above, this new inference on generic constructors means that functions that operate on class components in certain UI libraries like React can more correctly operate on generic class components.



```id
tstype ComponentClass<P> = new (props: P) => Component<P>;declare class Component<P> {  props: P;  constructor(props: P);}declare function myHoc<P>(C: ComponentClass<P>): ComponentClass<P>;type NestedProps<T> = { foo: number; stuff: T };declare class GenericComponent<T> extends Component<NestedProps<T>> {}// type is 'new <T>(props: NestedProps<T>) => Component<NestedProps<T>>'const GenericComponent2 = myHoc(GenericComponent);
```

# TypeScript 4.2

 

## Smarter Type Alias Preservation

TypeScript has a way to declare new names for types called type aliases.
If you’re writing a set of functions that all work on `string | number | boolean`, you can write a type alias to avoid repeating yourself over and over again.



```id
tstype BasicPrimitive = number | string | boolean;
```



TypeScript has always used a set of rules and guesses for when to reuse type aliases when printing out types.
For example, take the following code snippet.



```id
tsexport type BasicPrimitive = number | string | boolean;export function doStuff(value: BasicPrimitive) {  let x = value;  return x;}
```



If we hover our mouse over `x` in an editor like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the TypeScript Playground , we’ll get a quick info panel that shows the type `BasicPrimitive`.
Likewise, if we get the declaration file output (`.d.ts` output) for this file, TypeScript will say that `doStuff` returns `BasicPrimitive`.

However, what happens if we return a `BasicPrimitive` or `undefined`?



```id
tsexport type BasicPrimitive = number | string | boolean;export function doStuff(value: BasicPrimitive) {  if (Math.random() < 0.5) {    return undefined;  }  return value;}
```



We can see what happens in the TypeScript 4.1 playground .
While we might want TypeScript to display the return type of `doStuff` as `BasicPrimitive | undefined`, it instead displays `string | number | boolean | undefined`!
What gives?

Well this has to do with how TypeScript represents types internally.
When creating a union type out of one or more union types, it will always normalize those types into a new flattened union type - but doing that loses information.
The type-checker would have to find every combination of types from `string | number | boolean | undefined` to see what type aliases could have been used, and even then, there might be multiple type aliases to `string | number | boolean`.

In TypeScript 4.2, our internals are a little smarter.
We keep track of how types were constructed by keeping around parts of how they were originally written and constructed over time.
We also keep track of, and differentiate, type aliases to instances of other aliases!

Being able to print back the types based on how you used them in your code means that as a TypeScript user, you can avoid some unfortunately humongous types getting displayed, and that often translates to getting better `.d.ts` file output, error messages, and in-editor type displays in quick info and signature help.
This can help TypeScript feel a little bit more approachable for newcomers.

For more information, check out the first pull request that improves various cases around preserving union type aliases , along with a second pull request that preserves indirect aliases .

## Leading/Middle Rest Elements in Tuple Types

In TypeScript, tuple types are meant to model arrays with specific lengths and element types.



```id
ts// A tuple that stores a pair of numberslet a: [number, number] = [1, 2];// A tuple that stores a string, a number, and a booleanlet b: [string, number, boolean] = ["hello", 42, true];
```



Over time, TypeScript’s tuple types have become more and more sophisticated, since they’re also used to model things like parameter lists in JavaScript.
As a result, they can have optional elements and rest elements, and can even have labels for tooling and readability.



```id
ts// A tuple that has either one or two strings.let c: [string, string?] = ["hello"];c = ["hello", "world"]; // A labeled tuple that has either one or two strings.let d: [first: string, second?: string] = ["hello"];d = ["hello", "world"]; // A tuple with a *rest element* - holds at least 2 strings at the front,// and any number of booleans at the back.let e: [string, string, ...boolean[]]; e = ["hello", "world"];e = ["hello", "world", false];e = ["hello", "world", true, false, true];Try
```



In TypeScript 4.2, rest elements specifically been expanded in how they can be used.
In prior versions, TypeScript only allowed `...rest` elements at the very last position of a tuple type.

However, now rest elements can occur anywhere within a tuple - with only a few restrictions.



```id
tslet foo: [...string[], number]; foo = [123];foo = ["hello", 123];foo = ["hello!", "hello!", "hello!", 123]; let bar: [boolean, ...string[], boolean]; bar = [true, false];bar = [true, "some text", false];bar = [true, "some", "separated", "text", false];Try
```



The only restriction is that a rest element can be placed anywhere in a tuple, so long as it’s not followed by another optional element or rest element.
In other words, only one rest element per tuple, and no optional elements after rest elements.



```id
tsinterface Clown {  /*...*/}interface Joker {  /*...*/} let StealersWheel: [...Clown[], "me", ...Joker[]];A rest element cannot follow another rest element.1265A rest element cannot follow another rest element. let StringsAndMaybeBoolean: [...string[], boolean?];An optional element cannot follow a rest element.1266An optional element cannot follow a rest element.Try
```



These non-trailing rest elements can be used to model functions that take any number of leading arguments, followed by a few fixed ones.



```id
tsdeclare function doStuff(...args: [...names: string[], shouldCapitalize: boolean]): void; doStuff(/*shouldCapitalize:*/ false)doStuff("fee", "fi", "fo", "fum", /*shouldCapitalize:*/ true);Try
```



Even though JavaScript doesn’t have any syntax to model leading rest parameters, we were still able to declare `doStuff` as a function that takes leading arguments by declaring the `...args` rest parameter with a tuple type that uses a leading rest element .
This can help model lots of existing JavaScript out there!

For more details, see the original pull request .

## Stricter Checks For The `in` Operator

In JavaScript, it is a runtime error to use a non-object type on the right side of the `in` operator.
TypeScript 4.2 ensures this can be caught at design-time.



```id
ts"foo" in 42;Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'object'.2322Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'object'.Try
```



This check is fairly conservative for the most part, so if you have received an error about this, it is likely an issue in the code.

A big thanks to our external contributor Jonas Hübotter for their pull request !

## `--noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`

Back when TypeScript first introduced index signatures, you could only get properties declared by them with “bracketed” element access syntax like `person["name"]`.



```id
tsinterface SomeType {  /** This is an index signature. */  [propName: string]: any;} function doStuff(value: SomeType) {  let x = value["someProperty"];}Try
```



This ended up being cumbersome in situations where we need to work with objects that have arbitrary properties.
For example, imagine an API where it’s common to misspell a property name by adding an extra `s` character at the end.



```id
tsinterface Options {  /** File patterns to be excluded. */  exclude?: string[];   /**   * It handles any extra properties that we haven&apos;t declared as type &apos;any&apos;.   */  [x: string]: any;} function processOptions(opts: Options) {  // Notice we&apos;re *intentionally* accessing `excludes`, not `exclude`  if (opts.excludes) {    console.error(      "The option `excludes` is not valid. Did you mean `exclude`?"    );  }}Try
```



To make these types of situations easier, a while back, TypeScript made it possible to use “dotted” property access syntax like `person.name` when a type had a string index signature.
This also made it easier to transition existing JavaScript code over to TypeScript.

However, loosening the restriction also meant that misspelling an explicitly declared property became much easier.



```id
tsfunction processOptions(opts: Options) {  // ...   // Notice we&apos;re *accidentally* accessing `excludes` this time.  // Oops! Totally valid.  for (const excludePattern of opts.excludes) {    // ...  }}Try
```



In some cases, users would prefer to explicitly opt into the index signature - they would prefer to get an error message when a dotted property access doesn’t correspond to a specific property declaration.

That’s why TypeScript introduces a new flag called `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` .
Under this mode, you’ll be opted in to TypeScript’s older behavior that issues an error.
This new setting is not under the `strict` family of flags, since we believe users will find it more useful on certain codebases than others.

You can understand this feature in more detail by reading up on the corresponding pull request .
We’d also like to extend a big thanks to Wenlu Wang who sent us this pull request!

## `abstract` Construct Signatures

TypeScript allows us to mark a class as abstract .
This tells TypeScript that the class is only meant to be extended from, and that certain members need to be filled in by any subclass to actually create an instance.



```id
tsabstract class Shape {  abstract getArea(): number;} new Shape();Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.2511Cannot create an instance of an abstract class. class Square extends Shape {  #sideLength: number;   constructor(sideLength: number) {    super();    this.#sideLength = sideLength;  }   getArea() {    return this.#sideLength ** 2;  }} // Works fine.new Square(42);Try
```



To make sure this restriction in `new`-ing up `abstract` classes is consistently applied, you can’t assign an `abstract` class to anything that expects a construct signature.



```id
tsinterface HasArea {  getArea(): number;} let  HasArea' >Ctor: new () => HasArea = Shape;Type 'typeof Shape' is not assignable to type 'new () => HasArea'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.2322Type 'typeof Shape' is not assignable to type 'new () => HasArea'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.Try
```



This does the right thing in case we intend to run code like `new Ctor`, but it’s overly-restrictive in case we want to write a subclass of `Ctor`.



```id
tsabstract class Shape {  abstract getArea(): number;} interface HasArea {  getArea(): number;} function  HasArea): typeof (Anonymous class)' >makeSubclassWithArea( HasArea' >Ctor: new () => HasArea) {  return class extends  HasArea' >Ctor {    getArea() {      return 42    }  };} let MyShape =  HasArea): typeof (Anonymous class)' >makeSubclassWithArea(Shape);Argument of type 'typeof Shape' is not assignable to parameter of type 'new () => HasArea'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.2345Argument of type 'typeof Shape' is not assignable to parameter of type 'new () => HasArea'.
  Cannot assign an abstract constructor type to a non-abstract constructor type.Try
```



It also doesn’t work well with built-in helper types like `InstanceType`.



```id
tstype MyInstance =  any> = T extends abstract new (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any' >InstanceType<typeof Shape>;Try
```



That’s why TypeScript 4.2 allows you to specify an `abstract` modifier on constructor signatures.



```id
tsinterface HasArea {    getArea(): number;} // Works!let  HasArea' >Ctor: abstract new () => HasArea = Shape;Try
```



Adding the `abstract` modifier to a construct signature signals that you can pass in `abstract` constructors.
It doesn’t stop you from passing in other classes/constructor functions that are “concrete” - it really just signals that there’s no intent to run the constructor directly, so it’s safe to pass in either class type.

This feature allows us to write mixin factories in a way that supports abstract classes.
For example, in the following code snippet, we’re able to use the mixin function `withStyles` with the `abstract` class `SuperClass`.



```id
tsabstract class SuperClass {    abstract someMethod(): void;    badda() {}} type  = abstract new (...args: any[]) => T' >AbstractConstructor<' >T> = abstract new (...args: any[]) => ' >T function >(Ctor: T): ((abstract new (...args: any[]) => StyledClass) & {
    prototype: withStyles<any>.StyledClass;
}) & T' >withStyles<>(Ctor: T): ((abstract new (...args: any[]) => StyledClass) & {
    prototype: withStyles<any>.StyledClass;
}) & T' >T extends  = abstract new (...args: any[]) => T' >AbstractConstructor<object>>(' >Ctor: >(Ctor: T): ((abstract new (...args: any[]) => StyledClass) & {
    prototype: withStyles<any>.StyledClass;
}) & T' >T) {    abstract class StyledClass extends ' >Ctor {        getStyles() {            // ...        }    }    return StyledClass;} class SubClass extends (Ctor: typeof SuperClass): ((abstract new (...args: any[]) => withStyles<typeof SuperClass>.StyledClass) & {
    prototype: withStyles<any>.StyledClass;
}) & typeof SuperClass' >withStyles(SuperClass) {    someMethod() {        this.someMethod()    }}Try
```



Note that `withStyles` is demonstrating a specific rule, where a class (like `StyledClass`) that extends a value that’s generic and bounded by an abstract constructor (like `Ctor`) has to also be declared `abstract`.
This is because there’s no way to know if a class with more abstract members was passed in, and so it’s impossible to know whether the subclass implements all the abstract members.

You can read up more on abstract construct signatures on its pull request .

## Understanding Your Project Structure With `--explainFiles`

A surprisingly common scenario for TypeScript users is to ask “why is TypeScript including this file?“.
Inferring the files of your program turns out to be a complicated process, and so there are lots of reasons why a specific combination of `lib.d.ts` got used, why certain files in `node_modules` are getting included, and why certain files are being included even though we thought specifying `exclude` would keep them out.

That’s why TypeScript now provides an `explainFiles` flag.



```id
shtsc --explainFiles
```



When using this option, the TypeScript compiler will give some very verbose output about why a file ended up in your program.
To read it more easily, you can forward the output to a file, or pipe it to a program that can easily view it.



```id
sh# Forward output to a text filetsc --explainFiles > explanation.txt# Pipe output to a utility program like `less`, or an editor like VS Codetsc --explainFiles | lesstsc --explainFiles | code -
```



Typically, the output will start out by listing out reasons for including `lib.d.ts` files, then for local files, and then `node_modules` files.



```
TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es5.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es5' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2015.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2015.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2015' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2016.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2016.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2016' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2017.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2017.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2017' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2018.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2018.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2018' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2019.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2019.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2019' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2020.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.es2020.d.ts  Library referenced via 'es2020' from file 'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.esnext.d.ts'TS_Compiler_Directory/4.2.2/lib/lib.esnext.d.ts  Library 'lib.esnext.d.ts' specified in compilerOptions...

```



Right now, we make no guarantees about the output format - it might change over time.
On that note, we’re interested in improving this format if you have any suggestions!

## Improved Uncalled Function Checks in Logical Expressions

Thanks to further improvements from Alex Tarasyuk , TypeScript’s uncalled function checks now apply within `&&` and `||` expressions.

Under `strictNullChecks` , the following code will now error.



```id
tsfunction shouldDisplayElement(element: Element) {  // ...  return true;}function getVisibleItems(elements: Element[]) {  return elements.filter((e) => shouldDisplayElement && e.children.length);  //                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  // This condition will always return true since the function is always defined.  // Did you mean to call it instead.}
```



For more details, check out the pull request here .

## Destructured Variables Can Be Explicitly Marked as Unused

Thanks to another pull request from Alex Tarasyuk , you can now mark destructured variables as unused by prefixing them with an underscore (the `_` character).



```id
tslet [_first, second] = getValues();
```



Previously, if `_first` was never used later on, TypeScript would issue an error under `noUnusedLocals` .
Now, TypeScript will recognize that `_first` was intentionally named with an underscore because there was no intent to use it.

For more details, take a look at the full change .

## Relaxed Rules Between Optional Properties and String Index Signatures

String index signatures are a way of typing dictionary-like objects, where you want to allow access with arbitrary keys:



```id
tsconst movieWatchCount: { [key: string]: number } = {}; function watchMovie(title: string) {  movieWatchCount[title] = (movieWatchCount[title] ?? 0) + 1;}Try
```



Of course, for any movie title not yet in the dictionary, `movieWatchCount[title]` will be `undefined` (TypeScript 4.1 added the option `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to include `undefined` when reading from an index signature like this).
Even though it’s clear that there must be some strings not present in `movieWatchCount`, previous versions of TypeScript treated optional object properties as unassignable to otherwise compatible index signatures, due to the presence of `undefined`.



```id
tstype WesAndersonWatchCount = {  "Fantastic Mr. Fox"?: number;  "The Royal Tenenbaums"?: number;  "Moonrise Kingdom"?: number;  "The Grand Budapest Hotel"?: number;}; declare const wesAndersonWatchCount: WesAndersonWatchCount;const movieWatchCount: { [key: string]: number } = wesAndersonWatchCount;//    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ error!// Type &apos;WesAndersonWatchCount&apos; is not assignable to type &apos;{ [key: string]: number; }&apos;.//    Property &apos;"Fantastic Mr. Fox"&apos; is incompatible with index signature.//      Type &apos;number | undefined&apos; is not assignable to type &apos;number&apos;.//        Type &apos;undefined&apos; is not assignable to type &apos;number&apos;. (2322)Try
```



TypeScript 4.2 allows this assignment. However, it does not allow the assignment of non-optional properties with `undefined` in their types, nor does it allow writing `undefined` to a specific key:



```id
tstype BatmanWatchCount = {  "Batman Begins": number | undefined;  "The Dark Knight": number | undefined;  "The Dark Knight Rises": number | undefined;}; declare const batmanWatchCount: BatmanWatchCount; // Still an error in TypeScript 4.2.const movieWatchCount: { [key: string]: number } = batmanWatchCount;Type 'BatmanWatchCount' is not assignable to type '{ [key: string]: number; }'.
  Property '"Batman Begins"' is incompatible with index signature.
    Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'BatmanWatchCount' is not assignable to type '{ [key: string]: number; }'.
  Property '"Batman Begins"' is incompatible with index signature.
    Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'. // Still an error in TypeScript 4.2.// Index signatures don&apos;t implicitly allow explicit `undefined`.movieWatchCount["It&apos;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"] = undefined;Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.2322Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.Try
```



The new rule also does not apply to number index signatures, since they are assumed to be array-like and dense:



```id
tsdeclare let sortOfArrayish: { [key: number]: string };declare let numberKeys: { 42?: string }; sortOfArrayish = numberKeys;Type '{ 42?: string | undefined; }' is not assignable to type '{ [key: number]: string; }'.
  Property '42' is incompatible with index signature.
    Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.2322Type '{ 42?: string | undefined; }' is not assignable to type '{ [key: number]: string; }'.
  Property '42' is incompatible with index signature.
    Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.Try
```



You can get a better sense of this change by reading up on the original PR .

## Declare Missing Helper Function

Thanks to a community pull request from Alexander Tarasyuk , we now have a quick fix for declaring new functions and methods based on the call-site!

 

## Breaking Changes

We always strive to minimize breaking changes in a release.
TypeScript 4.2 contains some breaking changes, but we believe they should be manageable in an upgrade.

### `lib.d.ts` Updates

As with every TypeScript version, declarations for `lib.d.ts` (especially the declarations generated for web contexts), have changed.
There are various changes, though `Intl` and `ResizeObserver`’s may end up being the most disruptive.

### `noImplicitAny` Errors Apply to Loose `yield` Expressions

When the value of a `yield` expression is captured, but TypeScript can’t immediately figure out what type you intend for it to receive (i.e. the `yield` expression isn’t contextually typed), TypeScript will now issue an implicit `any` error.



```id
tsfunction* ' >g1() {  const value = yield 1;'yield' expression implicitly results in an 'any' type because its containing generator lacks a return-type annotation.7057'yield' expression implicitly results in an 'any' type because its containing generator lacks a return-type annotation.} function* ' >g2() {  // No error.  // The result of `yield 1` is unused.  yield 1;} function* ' >g3() {  // No error.  // `yield 1` is contextually typed by &apos;string&apos;.  const value: string = yield 1;} function* ' >g4(): ' >Generator<number, void, string> {  // No error.  // TypeScript can figure out the type of `yield 1`  // from the explicit return type of `g4`.  const value = yield 1;}Try
```



See more details in the corresponding changes .

### Expanded Uncalled Function Checks

As described above, uncalled function checks will now operate consistently within `&&` and `||` expressions when using `strictNullChecks` .
This can be a source of new breaks, but is typically an indication of a logic error in existing code.

### Type Arguments in JavaScript Are Not Parsed as Type Arguments

Type arguments were already not allowed in JavaScript, but in TypeScript 4.2, the parser will parse them in a more spec-compliant way.
So when writing the following code in a JavaScript file:



```id
tsf<T>(100);
```



TypeScript will parse it as the following JavaScript:



```id
jsf < T > 100;
```



This may impact you if you were leveraging TypeScript’s API to parse type constructs in JavaScript files, which may have occurred when trying to parse Flow files.

See the pull request for more details on what’s checked.

### Tuple size limits for spreads

Tuple types can be made by using any sort of spread syntax (`...`) in TypeScript.



```id
ts// Tuple types with spread elementstype NumStr = [number, string];type NumStrNumStr = [...NumStr, ...NumStr];// Array spread expressionsconst numStr = [123, "hello"] as const;const numStrNumStr = [...numStr, ...numStr] as const;
```



Sometimes these tuple types can accidentally grow to be huge, and that can make type-checking take a long time.
Instead of letting the type-checking process hang (which is especially bad in editor scenarios), TypeScript has a limiter in place to avoid doing all that work.

You can see this pull request for more details.

### `.d.ts` Extensions Cannot Be Used In Import Paths

In TypeScript 4.2, it is now an error for your import paths to contain `.d.ts` in the extension.



```id
ts// must be changed to something like//   - "./foo"//   - "./foo.js"import { Foo } from "./foo.d.ts";
```



Instead, your import paths should reflect whatever your loader will do at runtime.
Any of the following imports might be usable instead.



```id
tsimport { Foo } from "./foo";import { Foo } from "./foo.js";import { Foo } from "./foo/index.js";
```



### Reverting Template Literal Inference

This change removed a feature from TypeScript 4.2 beta.
If you haven’t yet upgraded past our last stable release, you won’t be affected, but you may still be interested in the change.

The beta version of TypeScript 4.2 included a change in inference to template strings.
In this change, template string literals would either be given template string types or simplify to multiple string literal types.
These types would then widen to `string` when assigning to mutable variables.



```id
tsdeclare const yourName: string;// 'bar' is constant.// It has type '`hello ${string}`'.const bar = `hello ${yourName}`;// 'baz' is mutable.// It has type 'string'.let baz = `hello ${yourName}`;
```



This is similar to how string literal inference works.



```id
ts// 'bar' has type '"hello"'.const bar = "hello";// 'baz' has type 'string'.let baz = "hello";
```



For that reason, we believed that making template string expressions have template string types would be “consistent”;
however, from what we’ve seen and heard, that isn’t always desirable.

In response, we’ve reverted this feature (and potential breaking change).
If you do want a template string expression to be given a literal-like type, you can always add `as const` to the end of it.



```id
tsdeclare const yourName: string;// 'bar' has type '`hello ${string}`'.const bar = `hello ${yourName}` as const;//                              ^^^^^^^^// 'baz' has type 'string'.const baz = `hello ${yourName}`;
```



### TypeScript’s `lift` Callback in `visitNode` Uses a Different Type

TypeScript has a `visitNode` function that takes a `lift` function.
`lift` now expects a `readonly Node[]` instead of a `NodeArray `.
This is technically an API breaking change which you can read more on here .

# TypeScript 4.1

 

## Template Literal Types

String literal types in TypeScript allow us to model functions and APIs that expect a set of specific strings.



```id
tsfunction setVerticalAlignment(location: "top" | "middle" | "bottom") {  // ...} setVerticalAlignment("middel");Argument of type '"middel"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top" | "middle" | "bottom"'.2345Argument of type '"middel"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top" | "middle" | "bottom"'.Try
```



This is pretty nice because string literal types can basically spell-check our string values.

We also like that string literals can be used as property names in mapped types.
In this sense, they’re also usable as building blocks:



```id
tstype Options = {  [K in "noImplicitAny" | "strictNullChecks" | "strictFunctionTypes"]?: boolean;};// same as//   type Options = {//       noImplicitAny?: boolean,//       strictNullChecks?: boolean,//       strictFunctionTypes?: boolean//   };
```



But there’s another place that string literal types could be used as building blocks: building other string literal types.

That’s why TypeScript 4.1 brings the template literal string type.
It has the same syntax as template literal strings in JavaScript , but is used in type positions.
When you use it with concrete literal types, it produces a new string literal type by concatenating the contents.



```id
tstype World = "world"; type Greeting = `hello ${World}`;        type Greeting = "hello world"Try
```



What happens when you have unions in substitution positions?
It produces the set of every possible string literal that could be represented by each union member.



```id
tstype Color = "red" | "blue";type Quantity = "one" | "two"; type SeussFish = `${Quantity | Color} fish`;type SeussFish = "one fish" | "two fish" | "red fish" | "blue fish"Try
```



This can be used beyond cute examples in release notes.
For example, several libraries for UI components have a way to specify both vertical and horizontal alignment in their APIs, often with both at once using a single string like `"bottom-right"`.
Between vertically aligning with `"top"`, `"middle"`, and `"bottom"`, and horizontally aligning with `"left"`, `"center"`, and `"right"`, there are 9 possible strings where each of the former strings is connected with each of the latter strings using a dash.



```id
tstype VerticalAlignment = "top" | "middle" | "bottom";type HorizontalAlignment = "left" | "center" | "right"; // Takes//   | "top-left"    | "top-center"    | "top-right"//   | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right"//   | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right" declare function setAlignment(value: `${VerticalAlignment}-${HorizontalAlignment}`): void; setAlignment("top-left");   // works!setAlignment("top-middel"); // error!Argument of type '"top-middel"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"'.2345Argument of type '"top-middel"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"'.setAlignment("top-pot");    // error! but good doughnuts if you&apos;re ever in SeattleArgument of type '"top-pot"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"'.2345Argument of type '"top-pot"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "middle-left" | "middle-center" | "middle-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"'.Try
```



While there are lots of examples of this sort of API in the wild, this is still a bit of a toy example since we could write these out manually.
In fact, for 9 strings, this is likely fine; but when you need a ton of strings, you should consider automatically generating them ahead of time to save work on every type-check (or just use `string`, which will be much simpler to comprehend).

Some of the real value comes from dynamically creating new string literals.
For example, imagine a `makeWatchedObject` API that takes an object and produces a mostly identical object, but with a new `on` method to detect for changes to the properties.



```id
tslet person = makeWatchedObject({  firstName: "Homer",  age: 42, // give-or-take  location: "Springfield",});person.on("firstNameChanged", () => {  console.log(`firstName was changed!`);});
```



Notice that `on` listens on the event `"firstNameChanged"`, not just `"firstName"`.
How would we type this?



```id
tstype PropEventSource<T> = {    on(eventName: `${string & keyof T}Changed`, callback: () => void): void;};/// Create a "watched object" with an 'on' method/// so that you can watch for changes to properties.declare function makeWatchedObject<T>(obj: T): T & PropEventSource<T>;
```



With this, we can build something that errors when we give the wrong property!



```id
ts// error!' >person. void): void' >on("firstName", () => {});Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "ageChanged" | "locationChanged"'.2345Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "ageChanged" | "locationChanged"'. // error!' >person. void): void' >on("frstNameChanged", () => {});Argument of type '"frstNameChanged"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "ageChanged" | "locationChanged"'.2345Argument of type '"frstNameChanged"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "ageChanged" | "locationChanged"'.Try
```



We can also do something special in template literal types: we can infer from substitution positions.
We can make our last example generic to infer from parts of the `eventName` string to figure out the associated property.



```id
tstype  = {
    on<K extends string & keyof T>(eventName: `${K}Changed`, callback: (newValue: T[K]) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<' >T> = {    (eventName: `${K}Changed`, callback: (newValue: T[K]) => void): void' >on<(eventName: `${K}Changed`, callback: (newValue: T[K]) => void): void' >K extends string & keyof ' >T>        (eventName: `${(eventName: `${K}Changed`, callback: (newValue: T[K]) => void): void' >K}Changed`,  void' >callback: (newValue: ' >T[(eventName: `${K}Changed`, callback: (newValue: T[K]) => void): void' >K]) => void ): void;}; declare function (obj: T): T & PropEventSource<T>' >makeWatchedObject<(obj: T): T & PropEventSource<T>' >T>(obj: (obj: T): T & PropEventSource<T>' >T): (obj: T): T & PropEventSource<T>' >T &  = {
    on<K extends string & keyof T>(eventName: `${K}Changed`, callback: (newValue: T[K]) => void): void;
}' >PropEventSource<(obj: T): T & PropEventSource<T>' >T>; let ' >person = (obj: {
    firstName: string;
    age: number;
    location: string;
}): {
    firstName: string;
    age: number;
    location: string;
} & PropEventSource<{
    firstName: string;
    age: number;
    location: string;
}>' >makeWatchedObject({    firstName: "Homer",    age: 42,    location: "Springfield",}); // works! &apos;newName&apos; is typed as &apos;string&apos;' >person.(eventName: "firstNameChanged", callback: (newValue: string) => void): void' >on("firstNameChanged", newName => {    // &apos;newName&apos; has the type of &apos;firstName&apos;    console.log(`new name is ${newName.toUpperCase()}`);}); // works! &apos;newAge&apos; is typed as &apos;number&apos;' >person.(eventName: "ageChanged", callback: (newValue: number) => void): void' >on("ageChanged", newAge => {    if (newAge < 0) {        console.log("warning! negative age");    }})Try
```



Here we made `on` into a generic method.
When a user calls with the string `"firstNameChanged'`, TypeScript will try to infer the right type for `K`.
To do that, it will match `K` against the content prior to `"Changed"` and infer the string `"firstName"`.
Once TypeScript figures that out, the `on` method can fetch the type of `firstName` on the original object, which is `string` in this case.
Similarly, when we call with `"ageChanged"`, it finds the type for the property `age` which is `number`).

Inference can be combined in different ways, often to deconstruct strings, and reconstruct them in different ways.
In fact, to help with modifying these string literal types, we’ve added a few new utility type aliases for modifying casing in letters (i.e. converting to lowercase and uppercase characters).



```id
tstype  = `${Uppercase<T>}`' >EnthusiasticGreeting<' >T extends string> = `${ = intrinsic' >Uppercase<' >T>}` type HELLO =  = `${Uppercase<T>}`' >EnthusiasticGreeting<"hello">;      type HELLO = "HELLO"Try
```



The new type aliases are `Uppercase`, `Lowercase`, `Capitalize` and `Uncapitalize`.
The first two transform every character in a string, and the latter two transform only the first character in a string.

For more details, see the original pull request and the in-progress pull request to switch to type alias helpers .

## Key Remapping in Mapped Types

Just as a refresher, a mapped type can create new object types based on arbitrary keys



```id
tstype Options = {  [K in "noImplicitAny" | "strictNullChecks" | "strictFunctionTypes"]?: boolean;};// same as//   type Options = {//       noImplicitAny?: boolean,//       strictNullChecks?: boolean,//       strictFunctionTypes?: boolean//   };
```



or new object types based on other object types.



```id
ts/// 'Partial<T>' is the same as 'T', but with each property marked optional.type Partial<T> = {  [K in keyof T]?: T[K];};
```



Until now, mapped types could only produce new object types with keys that you provided them; however, lots of the time you want to be able to create new keys, or filter out keys, based on the inputs.

That’s why TypeScript 4.1 allows you to re-map keys in mapped types with a new `as` clause.



```id
tstype MappedTypeWithNewKeys<T> = {    [K in keyof T as NewKeyType]: T[K]    //            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^    //            This is the new syntax!}
```



With this new `as` clause, you can leverage features like template literal types to easily create property names based off of old ones.



```id
tstype  = { [K in keyof T as `get${Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => T[K]; }' >Getters<' >T> = {    [K in keyof ' >T as `get${ = intrinsic' >Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => ' >T[K]}; interface Person {    name: string;    age: number;    location: string;} type  string;
    getAge: () => number;
    getLocation: () => string;
}' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>LazyPerson =  = { [K in keyof T as `get${Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => T[K]; }' >Getters<Person>;         type LazyPerson = {
    getName: () => string;
    getAge: () => number;
    getLocation: () => string;
}Try
```



and you can even filter out keys by producing `never`.
That means you don’t have to use an extra `Omit` helper type in some cases.



```id
ts// Remove the &apos;kind&apos; propertytype  = { [K in keyof T as Exclude<K, "kind">]: T[K]; }' >RemoveKindField<' >T> = {    [K in keyof ' >T as  = T extends U ? never : T' >Exclude<K, "kind">]: ' >T[K]}; interface Circle {    kind: "circle";    radius: number;} type KindlessCircle =  = { [K in keyof T as Exclude<K, "kind">]: T[K]; }' >RemoveKindField<Circle>;           type KindlessCircle = {
    radius: number;
}Try
```

## Recursive Conditional Types

In JavaScript it’s fairly common to see functions that can flatten and build up container types at arbitrary levels.
For example, consider the `.then()` method on instances of `Promise`.
`.then(...)` unwraps each promise until it finds a value that’s not “promise-like”, and passes that value to a callback.
There’s also a relatively new `flat` method on `Array`s that can take a depth of how deep to flatten.

Expressing this in TypeScript’s type system was, for all practical intents and purposes, not possible.
While there were hacks to achieve this, the types ended up looking very unreasonable.

That’s why TypeScript 4.1 eases some restrictions on conditional types - so that they can model these patterns.
In TypeScript 4.1, conditional types can now immediately reference themselves within their branches, making it easier to write recursive type aliases.

For example, if we wanted to write a type to get the element types of nested arrays, we could write the following `deepFlatten` type.



```id
tstype ElementType<T> = T extends ReadonlyArray<infer U> ? ElementType<U> : T;function deepFlatten<T extends readonly unknown[]>(x: T): ElementType<T>[] {  throw "not implemented";}// All of these return the type 'number[]':deepFlatten([1, 2, 3]);deepFlatten([[1], [2, 3]]);deepFlatten([[1], [[2]], [[[3]]]]);
```



Similarly, in TypeScript 4.1 we can write an `Awaited` type to deeply unwrap `Promise`s.



```id
tstype Awaited<T> = T extends PromiseLike<infer U> ? Awaited<U> : T;/// Like `promise.then(...)`, but more accurate in types.declare function customThen<T, U>(  p: Promise<T>,  onFulfilled: (value: Awaited<T>) => U): Promise<Awaited<U>>;
```



Keep in mind that while these recursive types are powerful, they should be used responsibly and sparingly.

First off, these types can do a lot of work which means that they can increase type-checking time.
Trying to model numbers in the Collatz conjecture or Fibonacci sequence might be fun, but don’t ship that in `.d.ts` files on npm.

But apart from being computationally intensive, these types can hit an internal recursion depth limit on sufficiently-complex inputs.
When that recursion limit is hit, that results in a compile-time error.
In general, it’s better not to use these types at all than to write something that fails on more realistic examples.

See more at the implementation .

## Checked Indexed Accesses (`--noUncheckedIndexedAccess`)

TypeScript has a feature called index signatures .
These signatures are a way to signal to the type system that users can access arbitrarily-named properties.



```id
tsinterface Options {  path: string;  permissions: number;   // Extra properties are caught by this index signature.  [propName: string]: string | number;} function checkOptions(opts: Options) {  opts.path; // string  opts.permissions; // number   // These are all allowed too!  // They have the type &apos;string | number&apos;.  opts.yadda.toString();  opts["foo bar baz"].toString();  opts[Math.random()].toString();}Try
```



In the above example, `Options` has an index signature that says any accessed property that’s not already listed should have the type `string | number`.
This is often convenient for optimistic code that assumes you know what you’re doing, but the truth is that most values in JavaScript do not support every potential property name.
Most types will not, for example, have a value for a property key created by `Math.random()` like in the previous example.
For many users, this behavior was undesirable, and felt like it wasn’t leveraging the full strict-checking of `strictNullChecks` .

That’s why TypeScript 4.1 ships with a new flag called `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` .
Under this new mode, every property access (like `foo.bar`) or indexed access (like `foo["bar"]`) is considered potentially undefined.
That means that in our last example, `opts.yadda` will have the type `string | number | undefined` as opposed to just `string | number`.
If you need to access that property, you’ll either have to check for its existence first or use a non-null assertion operator (the postfix `!` character).



```id
tsfunction checkOptions(opts: Options) {  opts.path; // string  opts.permissions; // number   // These are not allowed with noUncheckedIndexedAccess  opts.yadda.toString();'opts.yadda' is possibly 'undefined'.18048'opts.yadda' is possibly 'undefined'.  opts["foo bar baz"].toString();Object is possibly 'undefined'.2532Object is possibly 'undefined'.  opts[Math.random()].toString();Object is possibly 'undefined'.2532Object is possibly 'undefined'.   // Checking if it&apos;s really there first.  if (opts.yadda) {    console.log(opts.yadda.toString());  }   // Basically saying "trust me I know what I&apos;m doing"  // with the &apos;!&apos; non-null assertion operator.  opts.yadda!.toString();}Try
```



One consequence of using `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is that indexing into an array is also more strictly checked, even in a bounds-checked loop.



```id
tsfunction screamLines(strs: string[]) {  // This will have issues  for (let i = 0; i < strs..length: number' >length; i++) {    console.log(strs[i].toUpperCase());Object is possibly 'undefined'.2532Object is possibly 'undefined'.  }}Try
```



If you don’t need the indexes, you can iterate over individual elements by using a `for`-`of` loop or a `forEach` call.



```id
tsfunction screamLines(strs: string[]) {  // This works fine  for (const str of strs) {    console.log(str.toUpperCase());  }   // This works fine  strs..forEach(callbackfn: (value: string, index: number, array: string[]) => void, thisArg?: any): void' >forEach((str) => {    console.log(str.toUpperCase());  });}Try
```



This flag can be handy for catching out-of-bounds errors, but it might be noisy for a lot of code, so it is not automatically enabled by the `strict` flag; however, if this feature is interesting to you, you should feel free to try it and determine whether it makes sense for your team’s codebase!

You can learn more at the implementing pull request .

## `paths` without `baseUrl`

Using path-mapping is fairly common - often it’s to have nicer imports, often it’s to simulate monorepo linking behavior.

Unfortunately, specifying `paths` to enable path-mapping required also specifying an option called `baseUrl` , which allows bare specifier paths to be reached relative to the `baseUrl` too.
This also often caused poor paths to be used by auto-imports.

In TypeScript 4.1, the `paths` option can be used without `baseUrl` .
This helps avoid some of these issues.

## `checkJs` Implies `allowJs`

Previously if you were starting a checked JavaScript project, you had to set both `allowJs` and `checkJs` .
This was a slightly annoying bit of friction in the experience, so `checkJs` now implies `allowJs` by default.

 See more details at the pull request .

## React 17 JSX Factories

TypeScript 4.1 supports React 17’s upcoming `jsx` and `jsxs` factory functions through two new options for the `jsx` compiler option:

 `react-jsx`

- `react-jsxdev`

These options are intended for production and development compiles respectively.
Often, the options from one can extend from the other.
For example, a `tsconfig.json` for production builds might look like the following:



```
// ./src/tsconfig.json{  "compilerOptions": {    "module": "esnext",    "target": "es2015",    "jsx": "react-jsx",    "strict": true  },  "include": ["./**/*"]}
```



and one for development builds might look like the following:



```
// ./src/tsconfig.dev.json{  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",  "compilerOptions": {    "jsx": "react-jsxdev"  }}
```

## Editor Support for the JSDoc `@see` Tag

The JSDoc tag `@see` tag now has better support in editors for TypeScript and JavaScript.
This allows you to use functionality like go-to-definition in a dotted name following the tag.
For example, going to definition on `first` or `C` in the JSDoc comment just works in the following example:



```id
ts// @filename: first.tsexport class C {}// @filename: main.tsimport * as first from "./first";/** * @see first.C */function related() {}
```



Thanks to frequent contributor Wenlu Wang for implementing this !

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

`lib.d.ts` may have a set of changed APIs, potentially in part due to how the DOM types are automatically generated.
One specific change is that `Reflect.enumerate` has been removed, as it was removed from ES2016.

### `abstract` Members Can’t Be Marked `async`

Members marked as `abstract` can no longer be marked as `async`.
The fix here is to remove the `async` keyword, since callers are only concerned with the return type.

### `any`/`unknown` Are Propagated in Falsy Positions

Previously, for an expression like `foo && somethingElse`, the type of `foo` was `any` or `unknown`, the type of the whole that expression would be the type of `somethingElse`.

For example, previously the type for `x` here was `{ someProp: string }`.



```id
tsdeclare let foo: unknown;declare let somethingElse: { someProp: string };let x = foo && somethingElse;
```



However, in TypeScript 4.1, we are more careful about how we determine this type.
Since nothing is known about the type on the left side of the `&&`, we propagate `any` and `unknown` outward instead of the type on the right side.

The most common pattern we saw of this tended to be when checking compatibility with `boolean`s, especially in predicate functions.



```id
tsfunction isThing(x: any): boolean {  return x && typeof x === "object" && x.blah === "foo";}
```



Often the appropriate fix is to switch from `foo && someExpression` to `!!foo && someExpression`.

### `resolve`’s Parameters Are No Longer Optional in `Promise`s

When writing code like the following



```id
tsnew Promise((resolve) => {  doSomethingAsync(() => {    doSomething();    resolve();  });});
```



You may get an error like the following:



```
  resolve()  ~~~~~~~~~error TS2554: Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.  An argument for 'value' was not provided.
```



This is because `resolve` no longer has an optional parameter, so by default, it must now be passed a value.
Often this catches legitimate bugs with using `Promise`s.
The typical fix is to pass it the correct argument, and sometimes to add an explicit type argument.



```id
tsnew Promise<number>((resolve) => {  //     ^^^^^^^^  doSomethingAsync((value) => {    doSomething();    resolve(value);    //      ^^^^^  });});
```



However, sometimes `resolve()` really does need to be called without an argument.
In these cases, we can give `Promise` an explicit `void` generic type argument (i.e. write it out as `Promise `).
This leverages new functionality in TypeScript 4.1 where a potentially-`void` trailing parameter can become optional.



```id
tsnew Promise<void>((resolve) => {  //     ^^^^^^  doSomethingAsync(() => {    doSomething();    resolve();  });});
```



TypeScript 4.1 ships with a quick fix to help fix this break.

### Conditional Spreads Create Optional Properties

In JavaScript, object spreads (like `{ ...foo }`) don’t operate over falsy values.
So in code like `{ ...foo }`, `foo` will be skipped over if it’s `null` or `undefined`.

Many users take advantage of this to spread properties “conditionally”.



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age: number;  location: string;}interface Animal {  name: string;  owner: Person;}function copyOwner(pet?: Animal) {  return {    ...(pet && pet.owner),    otherStuff: 123,  };}// We could also use optional chaining here:function copyOwner(pet?: Animal) {  return {    ...pet?.owner,    otherStuff: 123,  };}
```



Here, if `pet` is defined, the properties of `pet.owner` will be spread in - otherwise, no properties will be spread into the returned object.

The return type of `copyOwner` was previously a union type based on each spread:



```
{ x: number } | { x: number, name: string, age: number, location: string }
```



This modeled exactly how the operation would occur: if `pet` was defined, all the properties from `Person` would be present; otherwise, none of them would be defined on the result.
It was an all-or-nothing operation.

However, we’ve seen this pattern taken to the extreme, with hundreds of spreads in a single object, each spread potentially adding in hundreds or thousands of properties.
It turns out that for various reasons, this ends up being extremely expensive, and usually for not much benefit.

In TypeScript 4.1, the returned type sometimes uses all-optional properties.



```
{    x: number;    name?: string;    age?: number;    location?: string;}
```



This ends up performing better and generally displaying better too.

For more details, see the original change .
While this behavior is not entirely consistent right now, we expect a future release will produce cleaner and more predictable results.

### Unmatched parameters are no longer related

TypeScript would previously relate parameters that didn’t correspond to each other by relating them to the type `any`.
With changes in TypeScript 4.1 , the language now skips this process entirely.
This means that some cases of assignability will now fail, but it also means that some cases of overload resolution can fail as well.
For example, overload resolution on `util.promisify` in Node.js may select a different overload in TypeScript 4.1, sometimes causing new or different errors downstream.

As a workaround, you may be best using a type assertion to squelch errors.

# TypeScript 3.4

 

## Faster subsequent builds with the `--incremental` flag

TypeScript 3.4 introduces a new flag called `incremental` which tells TypeScript to save information about the project graph from the last compilation.
The next time TypeScript is invoked with `incremental` , it will use that information to detect the least costly way to type-check and emit changes to your project.



```
// tsconfig.json{  "compilerOptions": {    "incremental": true,    "outDir": "./lib"  },  "include": ["./src"]}
```



By default with these settings, when we run `tsc`, TypeScript will look for a file called `.tsbuildinfo` in the output directory (`./lib`).
If `./lib/.tsbuildinfo` doesn’t exist, it’ll be generated.
But if it does, `tsc` will try to use that file to incrementally type-check and update our output files.

These `.tsbuildinfo` files can be safely deleted and don’t have any impact on our code at runtime - they’re purely used to make compilations faster.
We can also name them anything that we want, and place them anywhere we want using the `tsBuildInfoFile` option.



```
// front-end.tsconfig.json{  "compilerOptions": {    "incremental": true,    "tsBuildInfoFile": "./buildcache/front-end",    "outDir": "./lib"  },  "include": ["./src"]}
```



### Composite projects

Part of the intent with composite projects (`tsconfig.json`s with `composite` set to `true`) is that references between different projects can be built incrementally.
As such, composite projects will always produce `.tsbuildinfo` files.

### `outFile`

When `outFile` is used, the build information file’s name will be based on the output file’s name.
As an example, if our output JavaScript file is `./output/foo.js`, then under the `incremental` flag, TypeScript will generate the file `./output/foo.tsbuildinfo`.
As above, this can be controlled with the `tsBuildInfoFile` option.

## Higher order type inference from generic functions

TypeScript 3.4 can now produce generic function types when inference from other generic functions produces free type variables for inferences.
This means many function composition patterns now work better in 3.4.

To get more specific, let’s build up some motivation and consider the following `compose` function:



```id
tsfunction compose<A, B, C>(f: (arg: A) => B, g: (arg: B) => C): (arg: A) => C {  return (x) => g(f(x));}
```



`compose` takes two other functions:

 `f` which takes some argument (of type `A`) and returns a value of type `B`

- `g` which takes an argument of type `B` (the type `f` returned), and returns a value of type `C`

`compose` then returns a function which feeds its argument through `f` and then `g`.

When calling this function, TypeScript will try to figure out the types of `A`, `B`, and `C` through a process called type argument inference .
This inference process usually works pretty well:



```id
tsinterface Person {  name: string;  age: number;}function getDisplayName(p: Person) {  return p.name.toLowerCase();}function getLength(s: string) {  return s.length;}// has type '(p: Person) => number'const getDisplayNameLength = compose(getDisplayName, getLength);// works and returns the type 'number'getDisplayNameLength({ name: "Person McPersonface", age: 42 });
```



The inference process is fairly straightforward here because `getDisplayName` and `getLength` use types that can easily be referenced.
However, in TypeScript 3.3 and earlier, generic functions like `compose` didn’t work so well when passed other generic functions.



```id
tsinterface Box<T> {  value: T;}function makeArray<T>(x: T): T[] {  return [x];}function makeBox<U>(value: U): Box<U> {  return { value };}// has type '(arg: {}) => Box<{}[]>'const makeBoxedArray = compose(makeArray, makeBox);makeBoxedArray("hello!").value[0].toUpperCase();//                                ~~~~~~~~~~~// error: Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type '{}'.
```



In older versions, TypeScript would infer the empty object type (`{}`) when inferring from other type variables like `T` and `U`.

During type argument inference in TypeScript 3.4, for a call to a generic function that returns a function type, TypeScript will , as appropriate, propagate type parameters from generic function arguments onto the resulting function type.

In other words, instead of producing the type



```id
ts(arg: {}) => Box<{}[]>
```



TypeScript 3.4 produces the type



```id
ts<T>(arg: T) => Box<T[]>
```



Notice that `T` has been propagated from `makeArray` into the resulting type’s type parameter list.
This means that genericity from `compose`’s arguments has been preserved and our `makeBoxedArray` sample will just work!



```id
tsinterface Box<T> {  value: T;}function makeArray<T>(x: T): T[] {  return [x];}function makeBox<U>(value: U): Box<U> {  return { value };}// has type '<T>(arg: T) => Box<T[]>'const makeBoxedArray = compose(makeArray, makeBox);// works with no problem!makeBoxedArray("hello!").value[0].toUpperCase();
```



For more details, you can read more at the original change .

## Improvements for `ReadonlyArray` and `readonly` tuples

TypeScript 3.4 makes it a little bit easier to use read-only array-like types.

### A new syntax for `ReadonlyArray`

The `ReadonlyArray` type describes `Array`s that can only be read from.
Any variable with a reference to a `ReadonlyArray` can’t add, remove, or replace any elements of the array.



```id
tsfunction foo(arr: ReadonlyArray<string>) {  arr.slice(); // okay  arr.push("hello!"); // error!}
```



While it’s good practice to use `ReadonlyArray` over `Array` when no mutation is intended, it’s often been a pain given that arrays have a nicer syntax.
Specifically, `number[]` is a shorthand version of `Array `, just as `Date[]` is a shorthand for `Array `.

TypeScript 3.4 introduces a new syntax for `ReadonlyArray` using a new `readonly` modifier for array types.



```id
tsfunction foo(arr: readonly string[]) {  arr.slice(); // okay  arr.push("hello!"); // error!}
```



### `readonly` tuples

TypeScript 3.4 also introduces new support for `readonly` tuples.
We can prefix any tuple type with the `readonly` keyword to make it a `readonly` tuple, much like we now can with array shorthand syntax.
As you might expect, unlike ordinary tuples whose slots could be written to, `readonly` tuples only permit reading from those positions.



```id
tsfunction foo(pair: readonly [string, string]) {  console.log(pair[0]); // okay  pair[1] = "hello!"; // error}
```



The same way that ordinary tuples are types that extend from `Array` - a tuple with elements of type `T1`, `T2`, … `Tn` extends from `Array ` - `readonly` tuples are types that extend from `ReadonlyArray`. So a `readonly` tuple with elements `T1`, `T2`, … `Tn` extends from `ReadonlyArray `readonly` mapped type modifiers and `readonly` arrays

In earlier versions of TypeScript, we generalized mapped types to operate differently on array-like types.
This meant that a mapped type like `Boxify` could work on arrays and tuples alike.



```id
tsinterface Box<T> {  value: T;}type Boxify<T> = {  [K in keyof T]: Box<T[K]>;};// { a: Box<string>, b: Box<number> }type A = Boxify<{ a: string; b: number }>;// Array<Box<number>>type B = Boxify<number[]>;// [Box<string>, Box<number>]type C = Boxify<[string, boolean]>;
```



Unfortunately, mapped types like the `Readonly` utility type were effectively no-ops on array and tuple types.



```id
ts// lib.d.tstype Readonly<T> = {  readonly [K in keyof T]: T[K];};// How code acted *before* TypeScript 3.4// { readonly a: string, readonly b: number }type A = Readonly<{ a: string; b: number }>;// number[]type B = Readonly<number[]>;// [string, boolean]type C = Readonly<[string, boolean]>;
```



In TypeScript 3.4, the `readonly` modifier in a mapped type will automatically convert array-like types to their corresponding `readonly` counterparts.



```id
ts// How code acts now *with* TypeScript 3.4// { readonly a: string, readonly b: number }type A = Readonly<{ a: string; b: number }>;// readonly number[]type B = Readonly<number[]>;// readonly [string, boolean]type C = Readonly<[string, boolean]>;
```



Similarly, you could write a utility type like `Writable` mapped type that strips away `readonly`-ness, and that would convert `readonly` array containers back to their mutable equivalents.



```id
tstype Writable<T> = {  -readonly [K in keyof T]: T[K];};// { a: string, b: number }type A = Writable<{  readonly a: string;  readonly b: number;}>;// number[]type B = Writable<readonly number[]>;// [string, boolean]type C = Writable<readonly [string, boolean]>;
```



### Caveats

Despite its appearance, the `readonly` type modifier can only be used for syntax on array types and tuple types.
It is not a general-purpose type operator.



```id
tslet err1: readonly Set<number>; // error!let err2: readonly Array<boolean>; // error!let okay: readonly boolean[]; // works fine
```



You can see more details in the pull request .

## `const` assertions

TypeScript 3.4 introduces a new construct for literal values called `const` assertions.
Its syntax is a type assertion with `const` in place of the type name (e.g. `123 as const`).
When we construct new literal expressions with `const` assertions, we can signal to the language that

- no literal types in that expression should be widened (e.g. no going from `"hello"` to `string`)

- object literals get `readonly` properties

- array literals become `readonly` tuples



```id
ts// Type '"hello"'let x = "hello" as const;// Type 'readonly [10, 20]'let y = [10, 20] as const;// Type '{ readonly text: "hello" }'let z = { text: "hello" } as const;
```



Outside of `.tsx` files, the angle bracket assertion syntax can also be used.



```id
ts// Type '"hello"'let x = <const>"hello";// Type 'readonly [10, 20]'let y = <const>[10, 20];// Type '{ readonly text: "hello" }'let z = <const>{ text: "hello" };
```



This feature means that types that would otherwise be used just to hint immutability to the compiler can often be omitted.



```id
ts// Works with no types referenced or declared.// We only needed a single const assertion.function getShapes() {  let result = [    { kind: "circle", radius: 100 },    { kind: "square", sideLength: 50 },  ] as const;  return result;}for (const shape of getShapes()) {  // Narrows perfectly!  if (shape.kind === "circle") {    console.log("Circle radius", shape.radius);  } else {    console.log("Square side length", shape.sideLength);  }}
```



Notice the above needed no type annotations.
The `const` assertion allowed TypeScript to take the most specific type of the expression.

This can even be used to enable `enum`-like patterns in plain JavaScript code if you choose not to use TypeScript’s `enum` construct.



```id
tsexport const Colors = {  red: "RED",  blue: "BLUE",  green: "GREEN",} as const;// or use an 'export default'export default {  red: "RED",  blue: "BLUE",  green: "GREEN",} as const;
```



### Caveats

One thing to note is that `const` assertions can only be applied immediately on simple literal expressions.



```id
ts// Error! A 'const' assertion can only be applied// to a string, number, boolean, array, or object literal.let a = (Math.random() < 0.5 ? 0 : 1) as const;let b = (60 * 60 * 1000) as const;// Works!let c = Math.random() < 0.5 ? (0 as const) : (1 as const);let d = 3_600_000 as const;
```



Another thing to keep in mind is that `const` contexts don’t immediately convert an expression to be fully immutable.



```id
tslet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];let foo = {  name: "foo",  contents: arr,} as const;foo.name = "bar"; // error!foo.contents = []; // error!foo.contents.push(5); // ...works!
```



For more details, you can check out the respective pull request .

## Type-checking for `globalThis`

TypeScript 3.4 introduces support for type-checking ECMAScript’s new `globalThis` - a global variable that, well, refers to the global scope.
Unlike the above solutions, `globalThis` provides a standard way for accessing the global scope which can be used across different environments.



```id
ts// in a global file:var abc = 100;// Refers to 'abc' from above.globalThis.abc = 200;
```



Note that global variables declared with `let` and `const` don’t show up on `globalThis`.



```id
tslet answer = 42;// error! Property 'answer' does not exist on 'typeof globalThis'.globalThis.answer = 333333;
```



It’s also important to note that TypeScript doesn’t transform references to `globalThis` when compiling to older versions of ECMAScript.
As such, unless you’re targeting evergreen browsers (which already support `globalThis`), you may want to use an appropriate polyfill instead.

For more details on the implementation, see the feature’s pull request .

# TypeScript 3.3

 

## Improved behavior for calling union types

In prior versions of TypeScript, unions of callable types could only be invoked if they had identical parameter lists.



```id
tstype Fruit = "apple" | "orange";type Color = "red" | "orange";type FruitEater = (fruit: Fruit) => number; // eats and ranks the fruittype ColorConsumer = (color: Color) => string; // consumes and describes the colorsdeclare let f: FruitEater | ColorConsumer;// Cannot invoke an expression whose type lacks a call signature.//   Type 'FruitEater | ColorConsumer' has no compatible call signatures.ts(2349)f("orange");
```



However, in the above example, both `FruitEater`s and `ColorConsumer`s should be able to take the string `"orange"`, and return either a `number` or a `string`.

In TypeScript 3.3, this is no longer an error.



```id
tstype Fruit = "apple" | "orange";type Color = "red" | "orange";type FruitEater = (fruit: Fruit) => number; // eats and ranks the fruittype ColorConsumer = (color: Color) => string; // consumes and describes the colorsdeclare let f: FruitEater | ColorConsumer;f("orange"); // It works! Returns a 'number | string'.f("apple"); // error - Argument of type '"apple"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"orange"'.f("red"); // error - Argument of type '"red"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"orange"'.
```



In TypeScript 3.3, the parameters of these signatures are intersected together to create a new signature.

In the example above, the parameters `fruit` and `color` are intersected together to a new parameter of type `Fruit & Color`.
`Fruit & Color` is really the same as `("apple" | "orange") & ("red" | "orange")` which is equivalent to 

```
("apple" & "red") | ("apple" & "orange") | ("orange" & "red") | ("orange" & "orange")
```

.
Each of those impossible intersections reduces to `never`, and we’re left with `"orange" & "orange"` which is just `"orange"`.

## Caveats

This new behavior only kicks in when at most one type in the union has multiple overloads, and at most one type in the union has a generic signature.
That means methods on `number[] | string[]` like `map` (which is generic) still won’t be callable.

On the other hand, methods like `forEach` will now be callable, but under `noImplicitAny` there may be some issues.



```id
tsinterface Dog {  kind: "dog";  dogProp: any;}interface Cat {  kind: "cat";  catProp: any;}const catOrDogArray: Dog[] | Cat[] = [];catOrDogArray.forEach(animal => {  //                ~~~~~~ error!  // Parameter 'animal' implicitly has an 'any' type.});
```



This is still strictly more capable in TypeScript 3.3, and adding an explicit type annotation will work.



```id
tsinterface Dog {  kind: "dog";  dogProp: any;}interface Cat {  kind: "cat";  catProp: any;}const catOrDogArray: Dog[] | Cat[] = [];catOrDogArray.forEach((animal: Dog | Cat) => {  if (animal.kind === "dog") {    animal.dogProp;    // ...  } else if (animal.kind === "cat") {    animal.catProp;    // ...  }});
```



## Incremental file watching for composite projects in `--build --watch`

TypeScript 3.0 introduced a new feature for structuring builds called “composite projects”.
Part of the goal here was to ensure users could break up large projects into smaller parts that build quickly and preserve project structure, without compromising the existing TypeScript experience.
Thanks to composite projects, TypeScript can use `--build` mode to recompile only the set of projects and dependencies.
You can think of this as optimizing inter -project builds.

TypeScript 2.7 also introduced `--watch` mode builds via a new incremental “builder” API.
In a similar vein, the entire idea is that this mode only re-checks and re-emits changed files or files whose dependencies might impact type-checking.
You can think of this as optimizing intra -project builds.

Prior to 3.3, building composite projects using `--build --watch` actually didn’t use this incremental file watching infrastructure.
An update in one project under `--build --watch` mode would force a full build of that project, rather than determining which files within that project were affected.

In TypeScript 3.3, `--build` mode’s `--watch` flag does leverage incremental file watching as well.
That can mean significantly faster builds under `--build --watch`.
In our testing, this functionality has resulted in a reduction of 50% to 75% in build times of the original `--build --watch` times.
 You can read more on the original pull request for the change to see specific numbers, but we believe most composite project users will see significant wins here.

# TypeScript 4.0

 

## Variadic Tuple Types

Consider a function in JavaScript called `concat` that takes two array or tuple types and concatenates them together to make a new array.



```id
jsfunction concat(arr1, arr2) {  return [...arr1, ...arr2];}
```



Also consider `tail`, that takes an array or tuple, and returns all elements but the first.



```id
jsfunction tail(arg) {  const [_, ...result] = arg;  return result;}
```



How would we type either of these in TypeScript?

For `concat`, the only valid thing we could do in older versions of the language was to try and write some overloads.



```id
tsfunction concat(arr1: [], arr2: []): [];function concat<A>(arr1: [A], arr2: []): [A];function concat<A, B>(arr1: [A, B], arr2: []): [A, B];function concat<A, B, C>(arr1: [A, B, C], arr2: []): [A, B, C];function concat<A, B, C, D>(arr1: [A, B, C, D], arr2: []): [A, B, C, D];function concat<A, B, C, D, E>(arr1: [A, B, C, D, E], arr2: []): [A, B, C, D, E];function concat<A, B, C, D, E, F>(arr1: [A, B, C, D, E, F], arr2: []): [A, B, C, D, E, F];
```



Uh…okay, that’s…seven overloads for when the second array is always empty.
Let’s add some for when `arr2` has one argument.

 


```id
tsfunction concat<A2>(arr1: [], arr2: [A2]): [A2];function concat<A1, A2>(arr1: [A1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, C1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1, C1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, C1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, C1, D1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1, C1, D1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, C1, D1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1, C1, D1, E1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, A2];function concat<A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, A2>(arr1: [A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1], arr2: [A2]): [A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, A2];
```



We hope it’s clear that this is getting unreasonable.
Unfortunately, you’d also end up with the same sorts of issues typing a function like `tail`.

This is another case of what we like to call “death by a thousand overloads”, and it doesn’t even solve the problem generally.
It only gives correct types for as many overloads as we care to write.
If we wanted to make a catch-all case, we’d need an overload like the following:



```id
tsfunction concat<T, U>(arr1: T[], arr2: U[]): Array<T | U>;
```



But that signature doesn’t encode anything about the lengths of the input, or the order of the elements, when using tuples.

TypeScript 4.0 brings two fundamental changes, along with inference improvements, to make typing these possible.

The first change is that spreads in tuple type syntax can now be generic.
This means that we can represent higher-order operations on tuples and arrays even when we don’t know the actual types we’re operating over.
When generic spreads are instantiated (or, replaced with a real type) in these tuple types, they can produce other sets of array and tuple types.

For example, that means we can type function like `tail`, without our “death by a thousand overloads” issue.



```id
tsfunction (arr: readonly [any, ...T]): [...T]' >tail<(arr: readonly [any, ...T]): [...T]' >T extends any[]>(arr: readonly [any, ...(arr: readonly [any, ...T]): [...T]' >T]) {  const [_ignored, ...rest] = arr;  return rest;} const myTuple = [1, 2, 3, 4] as const;const myArray = ["hello", "world"]; const r1 = (arr: readonly [any, 2, 3, 4]): [2, 3, 4]' >tail(myTuple);      const r1: [2, 3, 4] const r2 = (arr: readonly [any, 2, 3, 4, ...string[]]): [2, 3, 4, ...string[]]' >tail([...myTuple, ...myArray] as const);      const r2: [2, 3, 4, ...string[]]Try
```



The second change is that rest elements can occur anywhere in a tuple - not just at the end!



```id
tstype Strings = [string, string];type Numbers = [number, number];type StrStrNumNumBool = [...Strings, ...Numbers, boolean];
```



Previously, TypeScript would issue an error like the following:



```
A rest element must be last in a tuple type.
```



But with TypeScript 4.0, this restriction is relaxed.

Note that in cases when we spread in a type without a known length, the resulting type becomes unbounded as well, and all the following elements factor into the resulting rest element type.



```id
tstype Strings = [string, string];type Numbers = number[];type Unbounded = [...Strings, ...Numbers, boolean];
```



By combining both of these behaviors together, we can write a single well-typed signature for `concat`:



```id
tstype Arr = readonly any[]; function (arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >concat<(arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >T extends Arr, (arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >U extends Arr>(arr1: (arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >T, arr2: (arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >U): [...(arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >T, ...(arr1: T, arr2: U): [...T, ...U]' >U] {  return [...arr1, ...arr2];}Try
```



While that one signature is still a bit lengthy, it’s just one signature that doesn’t have to be repeated, and it gives predictable behavior on all arrays and tuples.

This functionality on its own is great, but it shines in more sophisticated scenarios too.
For example, consider a function to partially apply arguments called `partialCall`.
`partialCall` takes a function - let’s call it `f` - along with the initial few arguments that `f` expects.
It then returns a new function that takes any other arguments that `f` still needs, and calls `f` when it receives them.



```id
jsfunction partialCall(f, ...headArgs) {  return (...tailArgs) => f(...headArgs, ...tailArgs);}
```



TypeScript 4.0 improves the inference process for rest parameters and rest tuple elements so that we can type this and have it “just work”.



```id
tstype Arr = readonly unknown[]; function (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >partialCall<(f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >T extends Arr, (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >U extends Arr, (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >R>(   R' >f: (...args: [...(f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >T, ...(f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >U]) => (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >R,  ...headArgs: (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >T) {  return (...tailArgs: (f: (...args: [...T, ...U]) => R, ...headArgs: T): (...tailArgs: U) => R' >U) =>  R' >f(...headArgs, ...tailArgs);}Try
```



In this case, `partialCall` understands which parameters it can and can’t initially take, and returns functions that appropriately accept and reject anything left over.



```id
tsconst  void' >foo = (x: string, y: number, z: boolean) => {}; const  void' >f1 = (f: (x: string, y: number, z: boolean) => void, x: string): (...tailArgs: [y: number, z: boolean]) => void' >partialCall( void' >foo, 100);Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.2345Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'. const  void' >f2 = (f: (x: string, y: number, z: boolean) => void, x: string, y: number, z: boolean): (...tailArgs: []) => void' >partialCall( void' >foo, "hello", 100, true, "oops");Expected 4 arguments, but got 5.2554Expected 4 arguments, but got 5. // This works!const  void' style='border-bottom: solid 2px lightgrey;'>f3 = (f: (args_0: string, y: number, z: boolean) => void, headArgs_0: string): (...tailArgs: [y: number, z: boolean]) => void' >partialCall( void' >foo, "hello");      const f3: (y: number, z: boolean) => void // What can we do with f3 now? // Works! void' >f3(123, true);  void' >f3();Expected 2 arguments, but got 0.2554Expected 2 arguments, but got 0.  void' >f3(123, "hello");Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'boolean'.2345Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'boolean'.Try
```



Variadic tuple types enable a lot of new exciting patterns, especially around function composition.
We expect we may be able to leverage it to do a better job type-checking JavaScript’s built-in `bind` method.
A handful of other inference improvements and patterns also went into this, and if you’re interested in learning more, you can take a look at the pull request for variadic tuples.

## Labeled Tuple Elements

Improving the experience around tuple types and parameter lists is important because it allows us to get strongly typed validation around common JavaScript idioms - really just slicing and dicing argument lists and passing them to other functions.
The idea that we can use tuple types for rest parameters is one place where this is crucial.

For example, the following function that uses a tuple type as a rest parameter…



```id
tsfunction foo(...args: [string, number]): void {  // ...}
```



…should appear no different from the following function…



```id
tsfunction foo(arg0: string, arg1: number): void {  // ...}
```



…for any caller of `foo`.



```id
tsfoo("hello", 42); foo("hello", 42, true);Expected 2 arguments, but got 3.2554Expected 2 arguments, but got 3.foo("hello");Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.2554Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.Try
```



There is one place where the differences begin to become observable though: readability.
In the first example, we have no parameter names for the first and second elements.
While these have no impact on type-checking, the lack of labels on tuple positions can make them harder to use - harder to communicate our intent.

That’s why in TypeScript 4.0, tuples types can now provide labels.



```id
tstype Range = [start: number, end: number];
```



To deepen the connection between parameter lists and tuple types, the syntax for rest elements and optional elements mirrors the syntax for parameter lists.



```id
tstype Foo = [first: number, second?: string, ...rest: any[]];
```



There are a few rules when using labeled tuples.
For one, when labeling a tuple element, all other elements in the tuple must also be labeled.



```id
tstype Bar = [first: string, number];Try
```



It’s worth noting - labels don’t require us to name our variables differently when destructuring.
They’re purely there for documentation and tooling.



```id
tsfunction foo(x: [first: string, second: number]) {    // ...     // note: we didn&apos;t need to name these &apos;first&apos; and &apos;second&apos;    const [a, b] = x;    a   const a: string    b   const b: number}Try
```



Overall, labeled tuples are handy when taking advantage of patterns around tuples and argument lists, along with implementing overloads in a type-safe way.
In fact, TypeScript’s editor support will try to display them as overloads when possible.

 

To learn more, check out the pull request for labeled tuple elements.

## Class Property Inference from Constructors

TypeScript 4.0 can now use control flow analysis to determine the types of properties in classes when `noImplicitAny` is enabled.

 


```id
tsclass Square {  // Previously both of these were any  area;   (property) Square.area: number  sideLength;      (property) Square.sideLength: number  constructor(sideLength: number) {    this.sideLength = sideLength;    this.area = sideLength ** 2;  }}Try
```



In cases where not all paths of a constructor assign to an instance member, the property is considered to potentially be `undefined`.

 


```id
tsclass Square {  sideLength;      (property) Square.sideLength: number | undefined   constructor(sideLength: number) {    if (Math.random()) {      this.sideLength = sideLength;    }  }   get area() {    return this.sideLength ** 2;Object is possibly 'undefined'.2532Object is possibly 'undefined'.  }}Try
```



In cases where you know better (e.g. you have an `initialize` method of some sort), you’ll still need an explicit type annotation along with a definite assignment assertion (`!`) if you’re in `strictPropertyInitialization` .



```id
tsclass Square {  // definite assignment assertion  //        v  sideLength!: number;  // type annotation   constructor(sideLength: number) {    this.initialize(sideLength);  }   initialize(sideLength: number) {    this.sideLength = sideLength;  }   get area() {    return this.sideLength ** 2;  }}Try
```



For more details, see the implementing pull request .

## Short-Circuiting Assignment Operators

JavaScript, and a lot of other languages, support a set of operators called compound assignment operators.
Compound assignment operators apply an operator to two arguments, and then assign the result to the left side.
You may have seen these before:



```id
ts// Addition// a = a + ba += b;// Subtraction// a = a - ba -= b;// Multiplication// a = a * ba *= b;// Division// a = a / ba /= b;// Exponentiation// a = a ** ba **= b;// Left Bit Shift// a = a << ba <<= b;
```



So many operators in JavaScript have a corresponding assignment operator!
Up until recently, however, there were three notable exceptions: logical and (`&&`), logical or (`||`), and nullish coalescing (`??`).

That’s why TypeScript 4.0 supports a new ECMAScript feature to add three new assignment operators: `&&=`, `||=`, and `??=`.

These operators are great for substituting any example where a user might write code like the following:



```id
tsa = a && b;a = a || b;a = a ?? b;
```



Or a similar `if` block like



```id
ts// could be 'a ||= b'if (!a) {  a = b;}
```



There are even some patterns we’ve seen (or, uh, written ourselves) to lazily initialize values, only if they’ll be needed.



```id
tslet values: string[];(values ?? (values = [])).push("hello");// After(values ??= []).push("hello");
```



(look, we’re not proud of all the code we write…)

On the rare case that you use getters or setters with side-effects, it’s worth noting that these operators only perform assignments if necessary.
In that sense, not only is the right side of the operator “short-circuited” - the assignment itself is too.



```id
tsobj.prop ||= foo();// roughly equivalent to either of the followingobj.prop || (obj.prop = foo());if (!obj.prop) {    obj.prop = foo();}
```



 Try running the following example to see how that differs from always performing the assignment.



```id
tsconst obj = {    get prop() {        console.log("getter has run");         // Replace me!        return Math.random() < 0.5;    },    set prop(_val: boolean) {        console.log("setter has run");    }}; function foo() {    console.log("right side evaluated");    return true;} console.log("This one always runs the setter");obj.prop = obj.prop || foo(); console.log("This one *sometimes* runs the setter");obj.prop ||= foo();Try
```



We’d like to extend a big thanks to community member Wenlu Wang for this contribution!

For more details, you can take a look at the pull request here .
You can also check out TC39’s proposal repository for this feature .

## `unknown` on `catch` Clause Bindings

Since the beginning days of TypeScript, `catch` clause variables have always been typed as `any`.
This meant that TypeScript allowed you to do anything you wanted with them.



```id
tstry {  // Do some work} catch (x) {  // x has type &apos;any&apos; - have fun!  console.log(x.message);  console.log(x.toUpperCase());  x++;  x.yadda.yadda.yadda();}Try
```



The above has some undesirable behavior if we’re trying to prevent more errors from happening in our error-handling code!
Because these variables have the type `any` by default, they lack any type-safety which could have errored on invalid operations.

That’s why TypeScript 4.0 now lets you specify the type of `catch` clause variables as `unknown` instead.
`unknown` is safer than `any` because it reminds us that we need to perform some sorts of type-checks before operating on our values.

 


```id
tstry {  // ...} catch (e: unknown) {  // Can&apos;t access values on unknowns  console.log(e.toUpperCase());'e' is of type 'unknown'.18046'e' is of type 'unknown'.   if (typeof e === "string") {    // We&apos;ve narrowed &apos;e&apos; down to the type &apos;string&apos;.    console.log(e.toUpperCase());  }}Try
```



While the types of `catch` variables won’t change by default, we might consider a new `strict` mode flag in the future so that users can opt in to this behavior.
In the meantime, it should be possible to write a lint rule to force `catch` variables to have an explicit annotation of either `: any` or `: unknown`.

For more details you can peek at the changes for this feature .

## Custom JSX Factories

When using JSX, a fragment is a type of JSX element that allows us to return multiple child elements.
When we first implemented fragments in TypeScript, we didn’t have a great idea about how other libraries would utilize them.
Nowadays most other libraries that encourage using JSX and support fragments have a similar API shape.

In TypeScript 4.0, users can customize the fragment factory through the new `jsxFragmentFactory` option.

As an example, the following `tsconfig.json` file tells TypeScript to transform JSX in a way compatible with React, but switches each factory invocation to `h` instead of `React.createElement`, and uses `Fragment` instead of `React.Fragment`.



```
{  "compilerOptions": {    "target": "esnext",    "module": "commonjs",    "jsx": "react",    "jsxFactory": "h",    "jsxFragmentFactory": "Fragment"  }}
```



In cases where you need to have a different JSX factory on a per-file basis , you can take advantage of the new `/** @jsxFrag */` pragma comment.
For example, the following…



```id
tsx// Note: these pragma comments need to be written// with a JSDoc-style multiline syntax to take effect. /** @jsx h *//** @jsxFrag Fragment */ import { h, Fragment } from "preact"; export const Header = (  <>    <, HTMLHeadingElement>' >h1>Welcome</, HTMLHeadingElement>' >h1>  </>);Try
```



…will get transformed to this output JavaScript…



```id
tsximport React from &apos;react&apos;;export const Header = (React.createElement(React.Fragment, null,    React.createElement("h1", null, "Welcome"))); Try
```



We’d like to extend a big thanks to community member Noj Vek for sending this pull request and patiently working with our team on it.

## Speed Improvements in `build` mode with `--noEmitOnError`

Previously, compiling a program after a previous compile with errors under `incremental` would be extremely slow when using the `noEmitOnError` flag.
This is because none of the information from the last compilation would be cached in a `.tsbuildinfo` file based on the `noEmitOnError` flag.

TypeScript 4.0 changes this which gives a great speed boost in these scenarios, and in turn improves `--build` mode scenarios (which imply both `incremental` and `noEmitOnError` ).

For details, read up more on the pull request .

## `--incremental` with `--noEmit`

TypeScript 4.0 allows us to use the `noEmit` flag while still leveraging `incremental` compiles.
This was previously not allowed, as `incremental` needs to emit a `.tsbuildinfo` files; however, the use-case to enable faster incremental builds is important enough to enable for all users.

For more details, you can see the implementing pull request .

## Editor Improvements

The TypeScript compiler doesn’t only power the editing experience for TypeScript itself in most major editors - it also powers the JavaScript experience in the Visual Studio family of editors and more.
For that reason, much of our work focuses on improving editor scenarios - the place you spend most of your time as a developer.

Using new TypeScript/JavaScript functionality in your editor will differ depending on your editor, but

 Visual Studio Code supports selecting different versions of TypeScript . Alternatively, there’s the JavaScript/TypeScript Nightly Extension to stay on the bleeding edge (which is typically very stable).

- Visual Studio 2017/2019 have [the SDK installers above] and MSBuild installs .

- Sublime Text 3 supports selecting different versions of TypeScript 

You can check out a partial list of editors that have support for TypeScript to learn more about whether your favorite editor has support to use new versions.

### Convert to Optional Chaining

Optional chaining is a recent feature that’s received a lot of love.
That’s why TypeScript 4.0 brings a new refactoring to convert common patterns to take advantage of optional chaining and nullish coalescing !

 

Keep in mind that while this refactoring doesn’t perfectly capture the same behavior due to subtleties with truthiness/falsiness in JavaScript, we believe it should capture the intent for most use-cases, especially when TypeScript has more precise knowledge of your types.

For more details, check out the pull request for this feature .

### `/** @deprecated */` Support

TypeScript’s editing support now recognizes when a declaration has been marked with a `/** @deprecated */` JSDoc comment.
That information is surfaced in completion lists and as a suggestion diagnostic that editors can handle specially.
In an editor like VS Code, deprecated values are typically displayed in a strike-though style like this .

 

This new functionality is available thanks to Wenlu Wang .
See the pull request for more details.

### Partial Semantic Mode at Startup

We’ve heard a lot from users suffering from long startup times, especially on bigger projects.
The culprit is usually a process called program construction .
This is the process of starting with an initial set of root files, parsing them, finding their dependencies, parsing those dependencies, finding those dependencies’ dependencies, and so on.
The bigger your project is, the longer you’ll have to wait before you can get basic editor operations like go-to-definition or quick info.

That’s why we’ve been working on a new mode for editors to provide a partial experience until the full language service experience has loaded up.
The core idea is that editors can run a lightweight partial server that only looks at the current files that the editor has open.

It’s hard to say precisely what sorts of improvements you’ll see, but anecdotally, it used to take anywhere between 20 seconds to a minute before TypeScript would become fully responsive on the Visual Studio Code codebase.
In contrast, our new partial semantic mode seems to bring that delay down to just a few seconds .
As an example, in the following video, you can see two side-by-side editors with TypeScript 3.9 running on the left and TypeScript 4.0 running on the right.

 
 

When restarting both editors on a particularly large codebase, the one with TypeScript 3.9 can’t provide completions or quick info at all.
On the other hand, the editor with TypeScript 4.0 can immediately give us a rich experience in the current file we’re editing, despite loading the full project in the background.

Currently the only editor that supports this mode is Visual Studio Code which has some UX improvements coming up in Visual Studio Code Insiders .
We recognize that this experience may still have room for polish in UX and functionality, and we have a list of improvements in mind.
We’re looking for more feedback on what you think might be useful.

For more information, you can see the original proposal , the implementing pull request , along with the follow-up meta issue .

### Smarter Auto-Imports

Auto-import is a fantastic feature that makes coding a lot easier; however, every time auto-import doesn’t seem to work, it can throw users off a lot.
One specific issue that we heard from users was that auto-imports didn’t work on dependencies that were written in TypeScript - that is, until they wrote at least one explicit import somewhere else in their project.

Why would auto-imports work for `@types` packages, but not for packages that ship their own types?
It turns out that auto-imports only work on packages your project already includes.
Because TypeScript has some quirky defaults that automatically add packages in `node_modules/@types` to your project, those packages would be auto-imported.
On the other hand, other packages were excluded because crawling through all your `node_modules` packages can be really expensive.

All of this leads to a pretty lousy getting started experience for when you’re trying to auto-import something that you’ve just installed but haven’t used yet.

TypeScript 4.0 now does a little extra work in editor scenarios to include the packages you’ve listed in your `package.json`’s `dependencies` (and `peerDependencies`) fields.
The information from these packages is only used to improve auto-imports, and doesn’t change anything else like type-checking.
This allows us to provide auto-imports for all of your dependencies that have types, without incurring the cost of a complete `node_modules` search.

In the rare cases when your `package.json` lists more than ten typed dependencies that haven’t been imported yet, this feature automatically disables itself to prevent slow project loading.
To force the feature to work, or to disable it entirely, you should be able to configure your editor.
For Visual Studio Code, this is the “Include Package JSON Auto Imports” (or 

```
typescript.preferences.includePackageJsonAutoImports
```

) setting.

 
For more details, you can see the proposal issue along with the implementing pull request .

## Our New Website!

 The TypeScript website has recently been rewritten from the ground up and rolled out!

 

 We already wrote a bit about our new site , so you can read up more there; but it’s worth mentioning that we’re still looking to hear what you think!
If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, you can file them over on the website’s issue tracker .

## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Our `lib.d.ts` declarations have changed - most specifically, types for the DOM have changed.
The most notable change may be the removal of `document.origin` which only worked in old versions of IE and Safari
MDN recommends moving to `self.origin` .

### Properties Overriding Accessors (and vice versa) is an Error

Previously, it was only an error for properties to override accessors, or accessors to override properties, when using `useDefineForClassFields` ; however, TypeScript now always issues an error when declaring a property in a derived class that would override a getter or setter in the base class.



```id
tsclass Base {  get foo() {    return 100;  }  set foo(value) {    // ...  }} class Derived extends Base {  foo = 10;'foo' is defined as an accessor in class 'Base', but is overridden here in 'Derived' as an instance property.2610'foo' is defined as an accessor in class 'Base', but is overridden here in 'Derived' as an instance property.}Try
```




```id
tsclass Base {  prop = 10;} class Derived extends Base {  get prop() {'prop' is defined as a property in class 'Base', but is overridden here in 'Derived' as an accessor.2611'prop' is defined as a property in class 'Base', but is overridden here in 'Derived' as an accessor.    return 100;  }}Try
```



See more details on the implementing pull request .

### Operands for `delete` must be optional.

When using the `delete` operator in `strictNullChecks` , the operand must now be `any`, `unknown`, `never`, or be optional (in that it contains `undefined` in the type).
Otherwise, use of the `delete` operator is an error.



```id
tsinterface Thing {  prop: string;} function f(x: Thing) {  delete x.prop;The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional.2790The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional.}Try
```



See more details on the implementing pull request .

### Usage of TypeScript’s Node Factory is Deprecated

Today TypeScript provides a set of “factory” functions for producing AST Nodes; however, TypeScript 4.0 provides a new node factory API.
As a result, for TypeScript 4.0 we’ve made the decision to deprecate these older functions in favor of the new ones.

For more details, read up on the relevant pull request for this change .

TypeScript: Documentation - TypeScript 3.2

# TypeScript 3.2

 

## `strictBindCallApply`

TypeScript 3.2 introduces a new `strictBindCallApply` compiler option (in the `strict` family of options) with which the `bind`, `call`, and `apply` methods on function objects are strongly typed and strictly checked.



```id
tsfunction foo(a: number, b: string): string {  return a + b;}let a = foo.apply(undefined, [10]); // error: too few argumentslet b = foo.apply(undefined, [10, 20]); // error: 2nd argument is a numberlet c = foo.apply(undefined, [10, "hello", 30]); // error: too many argumentslet d = foo.apply(undefined, [10, "hello"]); // okay! returns a string
```



This is achieved by introducing two new types, `CallableFunction` and `NewableFunction`, in `lib.d.ts`. These types contain specialized generic method declarations for `bind`, `call`, and `apply` for regular functions and constructor functions, respectively. The declarations use generic rest parameters (see #24897) to capture and reflect parameter lists in a strongly typed manner. In `strictBindCallApply` mode these declarations are used in place of the (very permissive) declarations provided by type `Function`.

## Caveats

Since the stricter checks may uncover previously unreported errors, this is a breaking change in `strict` mode.

Additionally, another caveat of this new functionality is that due to certain limitations, `bind`, `call`, and `apply` can’t yet fully model generic functions or functions that have overloads.
When using these methods on a generic function, type parameters will be substituted with the empty object type (`{}`), and when used on a function with overloads, only the last overload will ever be modeled.

## Generic spread expressions in object literals

In TypeScript 3.2, object literals now allow generic spread expressions which now produce intersection types, similar to the `Object.assign` function and JSX literals. For example:



```id
tsfunction taggedObject<T, U extends string>(obj: T, tag: U) {  return { ...obj, tag }; // T & { tag: U }}let x = taggedObject({ x: 10, y: 20 }, "point"); // { x: number, y: number } & { tag: "point" }
```



Property assignments and non-generic spread expressions are merged to the greatest extent possible on either side of a generic spread expression. For example:



```id
tsfunction foo1<T>(t: T, obj1: { a: string }, obj2: { b: string }) {  return { ...obj1, x: 1, ...t, ...obj2, y: 2 }; // { a: string, x: number } & T & { b: string, y: number }}
```



Non-generic spread expressions continue to be processed as before: Call and construct signatures are stripped, only non-method properties are preserved, and for properties with the same name, the type of the rightmost property is used. This contrasts with intersection types which concatenate call and construct signatures, preserve all properties, and intersect the types of properties with the same name. Thus, spreads of the same types may produce different results when they are created through instantiation of generic types:



```id
tsfunction spread<T, U>(t: T, u: U) {  return { ...t, ...u }; // T & U}declare let x: { a: string; b: number };declare let y: { b: string; c: boolean };let s1 = { ...x, ...y }; // { a: string, b: string, c: boolean }let s2 = spread(x, y); // { a: string, b: number } & { b: string, c: boolean }let b1 = s1.b; // stringlet b2 = s2.b; // number & string
```



## Generic object rest variables and parameters

TypeScript 3.2 also allows destructuring a rest binding from a generic variable. This is achieved by using the predefined `Pick` and `Exclude` helper types from `lib.d.ts`, and using the generic type in question as well as the names of the other bindings in the destructuring pattern.



```id
tsfunction excludeTag<T extends { tag: string }>(obj: T) {  let { tag, ...rest } = obj;  return rest; // Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, "tag">>}const taggedPoint = { x: 10, y: 20, tag: "point" };const point = excludeTag(taggedPoint); // { x: number, y: number }
```



## BigInt

BigInts are part of an upcoming proposal in ECMAScript that allow us to model theoretically arbitrarily large integers.
TypeScript 3.2 brings type-checking for BigInts, as well as support for emitting BigInt literals when targeting `esnext`.

BigInt support in TypeScript introduces a new primitive type called the `bigint` (all lowercase).
You can get a `bigint` by calling the `BigInt()` function or by writing out a BigInt literal by adding an `n` to the end of any integer numeric literal:



```id
tslet foo: bigint = BigInt(100); // the BigInt functionlet bar: bigint = 100n; // a BigInt literal// *Slaps roof of fibonacci function*// This bad boy returns ints that can get *so* big!function fibonacci(n: bigint) {  let result = 1n;  for (let last = 0n, i = 0n; i < n; i++) {    const current = result;    result += last;    last = current;  }  return result;}fibonacci(10000n);
```



While you might imagine close interaction between `number` and `bigint`, the two are separate domains.



```id
tsdeclare let foo: number;declare let bar: bigint;foo = bar; // error: Type 'bigint' is not assignable to type 'number'.bar = foo; // error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'bigint'.
```



As specified in ECMAScript, mixing `number`s and `bigint`s in arithmetic operations is an error.
You’ll have to explicitly convert values to `BigInt`s.



```id
tsconsole.log(3.141592 * 10000n); // errorconsole.log(3145 * 10n); // errorconsole.log(BigInt(3145) * 10n); // okay!
```



Also important to note is that `bigint`s produce a new string when using the `typeof` operator: the string `"bigint"`.
Thus, TypeScript correctly narrows using `typeof` as you’d expect.



```id
tsfunction whatKindOfNumberIsIt(x: number | bigint) {  if (typeof x === "bigint") {    console.log("'x' is a bigint!");  } else {    console.log("'x' is a floating-point number");  }}
```



We’d like to extend a huge thanks to Caleb Sander for all the work on this feature.
We’re grateful for the contribution, and we’re sure our users are too!

## Caveats

As we mentioned, BigInt support is only available for the `esnext` target.
It may not be obvious, but because BigInts have different behavior for mathematical operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc., providing functionality for older targets where the feature doesn’t exist (like `es2017` and below) would involve rewriting each of these operations.
TypeScript would need to dispatch to the correct behavior depending on the type, and so every addition, string concatenation, multiplication, etc. would involve a function call.

For that reason, we have no immediate plans to provide downleveling support.
On the bright side, Node 11 and newer versions of Chrome already support this feature, so you’ll be able to use BigInts there when targeting `esnext`.

Certain targets may include a polyfill or BigInt-like runtime object.
For those purposes you may want to add `esnext.bigint` to the `lib` setting in your compiler options.

## Non-unit types as union discriminants

TypeScript 3.2 makes narrowing easier by relaxing rules for what it considers a discriminant property.
Common properties of unions are now considered discriminants as long as they contain some singleton type (e.g. a string literal, `null`, or `undefined`), and they contain no generics.

As a result, TypeScript 3.2 considers the `error` property in the following example to be a discriminant, whereas before it wouldn’t since `Error` isn’t a singleton type.
Thanks to this, narrowing works correctly in the body of the `unwrap` function.



```id
tstype Result<T> = { error: Error; data: null } | { error: null; data: T };function unwrap<T>(result: Result<T>) {  if (result.error) {    // Here 'error' is non-null    throw result.error;  }  // Now 'data' is non-null  return result.data;}
```



## `tsconfig.json` inheritance via Node.js packages

TypeScript 3.2 now resolves `tsconfig.json`s from `node_modules`. When using a bare path for the `extends` field in `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript will dive into `node_modules` packages for us.



```
{  "extends": "@my-team/tsconfig-base",  "include": ["./**/*"],  "compilerOptions": {    // Override certain options on a project-by-project basis.    "strictBindCallApply": false  }}
```



Here, TypeScript will climb up `node_modules` folders looking for a `@my-team/tsconfig-base` package. For each of those packages, TypeScript will first check whether `package.json` contains a `"tsconfig"` field, and if it does, TypeScript will try to load a configuration file from that field. If neither exists, TypeScript will try to read from a `tsconfig.json` at the root. This is similar to the lookup process for `.js` files in packages that Node uses, and the `.d.ts` lookup process that TypeScript already uses.

This feature can be extremely useful for bigger organizations, or projects with lots of distributed dependencies.

## The new `--showConfig` flag

`tsc`, the TypeScript compiler, supports a new flag called `--showConfig`.
When running `tsc --showConfig`, TypeScript will calculate the effective `tsconfig.json` (after calculating options inherited from the `extends` field) and print that out.
This can be useful for diagnosing configuration issues in general.

## `Object.defineProperty` declarations in JavaScript

When writing in JavaScript files (using `allowJs` ), TypeScript now recognizes declarations that use `Object.defineProperty`.
This means you’ll get better completions, and stronger type-checking when enabling type-checking in JavaScript files (by turning on the `checkJs` option or adding a `// @ts-check` comment to the top of your file).



```id
js// @ts-checklet obj = {};Object.defineProperty(obj, "x", { value: "hello", writable: false });obj.x.toLowercase();//    ~~~~~~~~~~~//    error://     Property 'toLowercase' does not exist on type 'string'.//     Did you mean 'toLowerCase'?obj.x = "world";//  ~//  error://   Cannot assign to 'x' because it is a read-only property.
```

# TypeScript 3.9

 

## Improvements in Inference and `Promise.all`

Recent versions of TypeScript (around 3.7) have had updates to the declarations of functions like `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`.
Unfortunately, that introduced a few regressions, especially when mixing in values with `null` or `undefined`.



```id
tsinterface Lion {  roar(): void;}interface Seal {  singKissFromARose(): void;}async function visitZoo(  lionExhibit: Promise<Lion>,  sealExhibit: Promise<Seal | undefined>) {  let [lion, seal] = await Promise.all([lionExhibit, sealExhibit]);  lion.roar(); // uh oh  //  ~~~~  // Object is possibly 'undefined'.}
```



This is strange behavior!
The fact that `sealExhibit` contained an `undefined` somehow poisoned type of `lion` to include `undefined`.

Thanks to a pull request from Jack Bates , this has been fixed with improvements in our inference process in TypeScript 3.9.
The above no longer errors.
If you’ve been stuck on older versions of TypeScript due to issues around `Promise`s, we encourage you to give 3.9 a shot!

### What About the `awaited` Type?

If you’ve been following our issue tracker and design meeting notes, you might be aware of some work around a new type operator called `awaited` .
This goal of this type operator is to accurately model the way that `Promise` unwrapping works in JavaScript.

We initially anticipated shipping `awaited` in TypeScript 3.9, but as we’ve run early TypeScript builds with existing codebases, we’ve realized that the feature needs more design work before we can roll it out to everyone smoothly.
As a result, we’ve decided to pull the feature out of our main branch until we feel more confident.
We’ll be experimenting more with the feature, but we won’t be shipping it as part of this release.

## Speed Improvements

TypeScript 3.9 ships with many new speed improvements.
Our team has been focusing on performance after observing extremely poor editing/compilation speed with packages like material-ui and styled-components.
We’ve dived deep here, with a series of different pull requests that optimize certain pathological cases involving large unions, intersections, conditional types, and mapped types.

 https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36576 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36590 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36607 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36622 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36754 

- https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36696 

Each of these pull requests gains about a 5-10% reduction in compile times on certain codebases.
In total, we believe we’ve achieved around a 40% reduction in material-ui’s compile time!

We also have some changes to file renaming functionality in editor scenarios.
We heard from the Visual Studio Code team that when renaming a file, just figuring out which import statements needed to be updated could take between 5 to 10 seconds.
TypeScript 3.9 addresses this issue by changing the internals of how the compiler and language service caches file lookups .

While there’s still room for improvement, we hope this work translates to a snappier experience for everyone!

## `// @ts-expect-error` Comments

Imagine that we’re writing a library in TypeScript and we’re exporting some function called `doStuff` as part of our public API.
The function’s types declare that it takes two `string`s so that other TypeScript users can get type-checking errors, but it also does a runtime check (maybe only in development builds) to give JavaScript users a helpful error.



```id
tsfunction doStuff(abc: string, xyz: string) {  assert(typeof abc === "string");  assert(typeof xyz === "string");  // do some stuff}
```



So TypeScript users will get a helpful red squiggle and an error message when they misuse this function, and JavaScript users will get an assertion error.
We’d like to test this behavior, so we’ll write a unit test.



```id
tsexpect(() => {  doStuff(123, 456);}).toThrow();
```



Unfortunately if our tests are written in TypeScript, TypeScript will give us an error!



```id
tsdoStuff(123, 456);//          ~~~// error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```



That’s why TypeScript 3.9 brings a new feature: `// @ts-expect-error` comments.
When a line is preceded by a `// @ts-expect-error` comment, TypeScript will suppress that error from being reported;
but if there’s no error, TypeScript will report that `// @ts-expect-error` wasn’t necessary.

As a quick example, the following code is okay



```id
ts// @ts-expect-errorconsole.log(47 * "octopus");
```



while the following code



```id
ts// @ts-expect-errorconsole.log(1 + 1);
```



results in the error



```
Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive.
```



We’d like to extend a big thanks to Josh Goldberg , the contributor who implemented this feature.
For more information, you can take a look at the `ts-expect-error` pull request .

### `ts-ignore` or `ts-expect-error`?

In some ways `// @ts-expect-error` can act as a suppression comment, similar to `// @ts-ignore`.
The difference is that `// @ts-ignore` will do nothing if the following line is error-free.

You might be tempted to switch existing `// @ts-ignore` comments over to `// @ts-expect-error`, and you might be wondering which is appropriate for future code.
While it’s entirely up to you and your team, we have some ideas of which to pick in certain situations.

Pick `ts-expect-error` if:

- you’re writing test code where you actually want the type system to error on an operation

- you expect a fix to be coming in fairly quickly and you just need a quick workaround

- you’re in a reasonably-sized project with a proactive team that wants to remove suppression comments as soon as affected code is valid again

Pick `ts-ignore` if:

- you have a larger project and new errors have appeared in code with no clear owner

- you are in the middle of an upgrade between two different versions of TypeScript, and a line of code errors in one version but not another.

- you honestly don’t have the time to decide which of these options is better.

## Uncalled Function Checks in Conditional Expressions

In TypeScript 3.7 we introduced uncalled function checks to report an error when you’ve forgotten to call a function.



```id
tsfunction hasImportantPermissions(): boolean {  // ...}// Oops!if (hasImportantPermissions) {  //  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  // This condition will always return true since the function is always defined.  // Did you mean to call it instead?  deleteAllTheImportantFiles();}
```



However, this error only applied to conditions in `if` statements.
Thanks to a pull request from Alexander Tarasyuk , this feature is also now supported in ternary conditionals (i.e. the `cond ? trueExpr : falseExpr` syntax).



```id
tsdeclare function listFilesOfDirectory(dirPath: string): string[];declare function isDirectory(): boolean;function getAllFiles(startFileName: string) {  const result: string[] = [];  traverse(startFileName);  return result;  function traverse(currentPath: string) {    return isDirectory      ? //     ~~~~~~~~~~~        // This condition will always return true        // since the function is always defined.        // Did you mean to call it instead?        listFilesOfDirectory(currentPath).forEach(traverse)      : result.push(currentPath);  }}
```



 https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/36048 

## Editor Improvements

The TypeScript compiler not only powers the TypeScript editing experience in most major editors, it also powers the JavaScript experience in the Visual Studio family of editors and more.
Using new TypeScript/JavaScript functionality in your editor will differ depending on your editor, but

- Visual Studio Code supports selecting different versions of TypeScript . Alternatively, there’s the JavaScript/TypeScript Nightly Extension to stay on the bleeding edge (which is typically very stable).

- Visual Studio 2017/2019 have [the SDK installers above] and MSBuild installs .

- Sublime Text 3 supports selecting different versions of TypeScript 

### CommonJS Auto-Imports in JavaScript

One great new improvement is in auto-imports in JavaScript files using CommonJS modules.

In older versions, TypeScript always assumed that regardless of your file, you wanted an ECMAScript-style import like



```id
jsimport * as fs from "fs";
```



However, not everyone is targeting ECMAScript-style modules when writing JavaScript files.
Plenty of users still use CommonJS-style `require(...)` imports like so



```id
jsconst fs = require("fs");
```



TypeScript now automatically detects the types of imports you’re using to keep your file’s style clean and consistent.

 

For more details on the change, see the corresponding pull request .

### Code Actions Preserve Newlines

TypeScript’s refactorings and quick fixes often didn’t do a great job of preserving newlines.
As a really basic example, take the following code.



```id
tsconst maxValue = 100;/*start*/for (let i = 0; i <= maxValue; i++) {  // First get the squared value.  let square = i ** 2;  // Now print the squared value.  console.log(square);}/*end*/
```



If we highlighted the range from `/*start*/` to `/*end*/` in our editor to extract to a new function, we’d end up with code like the following.



```id
tsconst maxValue = 100;printSquares();function printSquares() {  for (let i = 0; i <= maxValue; i++) {    // First get the squared value.    let square = i ** 2;    // Now print the squared value.    console.log(square);  }}
```



 

That’s not ideal - we had a blank line between each statement in our `for` loop, but the refactoring got rid of it!
TypeScript 3.9 does a little more work to preserve what we write.



```id
tsconst maxValue = 100;printSquares();function printSquares() {  for (let i = 0; i <= maxValue; i++) {    // First get the squared value.    let square = i ** 2;    // Now print the squared value.    console.log(square);  }}
```

### Quick Fixes for Missing Return Expressions

There are occasions where we might forget to return the value of the last statement in a function, especially when adding curly braces to arrow functions.



```id
ts// beforelet f1 = () => 42;// oops - not the same!let f2 = () => {  42;};
```



Thanks to a pull request from community member Wenlu Wang , TypeScript can provide a quick-fix to add missing `return` statements, remove curly braces, or add parentheses to arrow function bodies that look suspiciously like object literals.

 

### Support for “Solution Style” `tsconfig.json` Files

Editors need to figure out which configuration file a file belongs to so that it can apply the appropriate options and figure out which other files are included in the current “project”.
By default, editors powered by TypeScript’s language server do this by walking up each parent directory to find a `tsconfig.json`.

One case where this slightly fell over is when a `tsconfig.json` simply existed to reference other `tsconfig.json` files.



```
// tsconfig.json{  "files": [],  "references": [    { "path": "./tsconfig.shared.json" },    { "path": "./tsconfig.frontend.json" },    { "path": "./tsconfig.backend.json" }  ]}
```



This file that really does nothing but manage other project files is often called a “solution” in some environments.
Here, none of these `tsconfig.*.json` files get picked up by the server, but we’d really like the language server to understand that the current `.ts` file probably belongs to one of the mentioned projects in this root `tsconfig.json`.

TypeScript 3.9 adds support to editing scenarios for this configuration.
For more details, take a look at the pull request that added this functionality .

## Breaking Changes

### Parsing Differences in Optional Chaining and Non-Null Assertions

TypeScript recently implemented the optional chaining operator, but we’ve received user feedback that the behavior of optional chaining (`?.`) with the non-null assertion operator (`!`) is extremely counter-intuitive.

Specifically, in previous versions, the code



```id
tsfoo?.bar!.baz;
```



was interpreted to be equivalent to the following JavaScript.



```id
js(foo?.bar).baz;
```



In the above code the parentheses stop the “short-circuiting” behavior of optional chaining, so if `foo` is `undefined`, accessing `baz` will cause a runtime error.

The Babel team who pointed this behavior out, and most users who provided feedback to us, believe that this behavior is wrong.
We do too!
The thing we heard the most was that the `!` operator should just “disappear” since the intent was to remove `null` and `undefined` from the type of `bar`.

In other words, most people felt that the original snippet should be interpreted as



```id
jsfoo?.bar.baz;
```



which just evaluates to `undefined` when `foo` is `undefined`.

This is a breaking change, but we believe most code was written with the new interpretation in mind.
Users who want to revert to the old behavior can add explicit parentheses around the left side of the `!` operator.



```id
tsfoo?.bar!.baz;
```



### `}` and `>` are Now Invalid JSX Text Characters

The JSX Specification forbids the use of the `}` and `>` characters in text positions.
TypeScript and Babel have both decided to enforce this rule to be more conformant.
The new way to insert these characters is to use an HTML escape code (e.g. ` 2 &gt 1 `) or insert an expression with a string literal (e.g. ` 2 {">"} 1 `).

Luckily, thanks to the pull request enforcing this from Brad Zacher , you’ll get an error message along the lines of



```
Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'>'}` or `>`?Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'}'}` or `&rbrace;`?
```



For example:



```id
tsxlet directions = <span>Navigate to: Menu Bar > Tools > Options</span>;//                                           ~       ~// Unexpected token. Did you mean `{'>'}` or `>`?
```



That error message came with a handy quick fix, and thanks to Alexander Tarasyuk , you can apply these changes in bulk if you have a lot of errors.

### Stricter Checks on Intersections and Optional Properties

Generally, an intersection type like `A & B` is assignable to `C` if either `A` or `B` is assignable to `C`; however, sometimes that has problems with optional properties.
For example, take the following:



```id
tsinterface A {  a: number; // notice this is 'number'}interface B {  b: string;}interface C {  a?: boolean; // notice this is 'boolean'  b: string;}declare let x: A & B;declare let y: C;y = x;
```



In previous versions of TypeScript, this was allowed because while `A` was totally incompatible with `C`, `B` was compatible with `C`.

In TypeScript 3.9, so long as every type in an intersection is a concrete object type, the type system will consider all of the properties at once.
As a result, TypeScript will see that the `a` property of `A & B` is incompatible with that of `C`:



```
Type 'A & B' is not assignable to type 'C'.  Types of property 'a' are incompatible.    Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'boolean | undefined'.
```



For more information on this change, see the corresponding pull request .

### Intersections Reduced By Discriminant Properties

There are a few cases where you might end up with types that describe values that just don’t exist.
For example



```id
tsdeclare function smushObjects<T, U>(x: T, y: U): T & U;interface Circle {  kind: "circle";  radius: number;}interface Square {  kind: "square";  sideLength: number;}declare let x: Circle;declare let y: Square;let z = smushObjects(x, y);console.log(z.kind);
```



This code is slightly weird because there’s really no way to create an intersection of a `Circle` and a `Square` - they have two incompatible `kind` fields.
In previous versions of TypeScript, this code was allowed and the type of `kind` itself was `never` because `"circle" & "square"` described a set of values that could `never` exist.

In TypeScript 3.9, the type system is more aggressive here - it notices that it’s impossible to intersect `Circle` and `Square` because of their `kind` properties.
So instead of collapsing the type of `z.kind` to `never`, it collapses the type of `z` itself (`Circle & Square`) to `never`.
That means the above code now errors with:



```
Property 'kind' does not exist on type 'never'.
```



Most of the breaks we observed seem to correspond with slightly incorrect type declarations.
For more details, see the original pull request .

### Getters/Setters are No Longer Enumerable

In older versions of TypeScript, `get` and `set` accessors in classes were emitted in a way that made them enumerable; however, this wasn’t compliant with the ECMAScript specification which states that they must be non-enumerable.
As a result, TypeScript code that targeted ES5 and ES2015 could differ in behavior.

Thanks to a pull request from GitHub user pathurs , TypeScript 3.9 now conforms more closely with ECMAScript in this regard.

### Type Parameters That Extend `any` No Longer Act as `any`

In previous versions of TypeScript, a type parameter constrained to `any` could be treated as `any`.



```id
tsfunction foo<T extends any>(arg: T) {  arg.spfjgerijghoied; // no error!}
```



This was an oversight, so TypeScript 3.9 takes a more conservative approach and issues an error on these questionable operations.



```id
tsfunction foo<T extends any>(arg: T) {  arg.spfjgerijghoied;  //  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  // Property 'spfjgerijghoied' does not exist on type 'T'.}
```



### `export *` is Always Retained

In previous TypeScript versions, declarations like `export * from "foo"` would be dropped in our JavaScript output if `foo` didn’t export any values.
This sort of emit is problematic because it’s type-directed and can’t be emulated by Babel.
TypeScript 3.9 will always emit these `export *` declarations.
In practice, we don’t expect this to break much existing code.

### More libdom.d.ts refinements

We are continuing to move more of TypeScript’s built-in .d.ts library (lib.d.ts and family) to be generated from Web IDL files directly from the DOM specification.
As a result some vendor-specific types related to media access have been removed.

Adding this file to an ambient `*.d.ts` to your project will bring them back:

 


```id
tsinterface AudioTrackList {     [Symbol.iterator](): IterableIterator<AudioTrack>; }interface HTMLVideoElement {  readonly audioTracks: AudioTrackList  msFrameStep(forward: boolean): void;  msInsertVideoEffect(activatableClassId: string, effectRequired: boolean, config?: any): void;  msSetVideoRectangle(left: number, top: number, right: number, bottom: number): void;  webkitEnterFullScreen(): void;  webkitEnterFullscreen(): void;  webkitExitFullScreen(): void;  webkitExitFullscreen(): void;  msHorizontalMirror: boolean;  readonly msIsLayoutOptimalForPlayback: boolean;  readonly msIsStereo3D: boolean;  msStereo3DPackingMode: string;  msStereo3DRenderMode: string;  msZoom: boolean;  onMSVideoFormatChanged: ((this: HTMLVideoElement, ev: Event) => any) | null;  onMSVideoFrameStepCompleted: ((this: HTMLVideoElement, ev: Event) => any) | null;  onMSVideoOptimalLayoutChanged: ((this: HTMLVideoElement, ev: Event) => any) | null;  webkitDisplayingFullscreen: boolean;  webkitSupportsFullscreen: boolean;}interface MediaError {  readonly msExtendedCode: number;  readonly MS_MEDIA_ERR_ENCRYPTED: number;}
```

# TypeScript 3.1

 

## Mapped types on tuples and arrays

In TypeScript 3.1, mapped object types [1] over tuples and arrays now produce new tuples/arrays, rather than creating a new type where members like `push()`, `pop()`, and `length` are converted.
For example:



```id
tstype MapToPromise<T> = { [K in keyof T]: Promise<T[K]> };type Coordinate = [number, number];type PromiseCoordinate = MapToPromise<Coordinate>; // [Promise<number>, Promise<number>]
```



`MapToPromise` takes a type `T`, and when that type is a tuple like `Coordinate`, only the numeric properties are converted.
In `[number, number]`, there are two numerically named properties: `0` and `1`.
When given a tuple like that, `MapToPromise` will create a new tuple where the `0` and `1` properties are `Promise`s of the original type.
So the resulting type `PromiseCoordinate` ends up with the type `[Promise , Promise ]`.

## Properties declarations on functions

TypeScript 3.1 brings the ability to define properties on function declarations and `const`-declared functions, simply by assigning to properties on these functions in the same scope.
This allows us to write canonical JavaScript code without resorting to `namespace` hacks.
For example:



```id
tsfunction readImage(path: string, callback: (err: any, image: Image) => void) {  // ...}readImage.sync = (path: string) => {  const contents = fs.readFileSync(path);  return decodeImageSync(contents);};
```



Here, we have a function `readImage` which reads an image in a non-blocking asynchronous way.
In addition to `readImage`, we’ve provided a convenience function on `readImage` itself called `readImage.sync`.

While ECMAScript exports are often a better way of providing this functionality, this new support allows code written in this style to “just work” in TypeScript.
Additionally, this approach for property declarations allows us to express common patterns like `defaultProps` and `propTypes` on React function components (formerly known as SFCs).



```id
tsexport const FooComponent = ({ name }) => <div>Hello! I am {name}</div>;FooComponent.defaultProps = {  name: "(anonymous)",};
```


 {
 if (err) callback(err, undefined);
 else decodeImage(data, (err, image) => {
 if (err) callback(err, undefined);
 else callback(undefined, image);
 });
 });
-->
 

 [1] More specifically, homomorphic mapped types like in the above form.

## Version selection with `typesVersions`

Feedback from our community, as well as our own experience, has shown us that leveraging the newest TypeScript features while also accommodating users on the older versions are difficult.
TypeScript introduces a new feature called `typesVersions` to help accommodate these scenarios.

You can read about it in the Publishing section of the declaration files section
